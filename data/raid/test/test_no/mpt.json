    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type.

To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection.

Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects.

    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions.

    "Many deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation involve a Fully\nConvolutional Neural Network (FCN) followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF)\nto carry out inference over an image.

We therefore suggest incorporating\ninto the inference algorithm additional higher-order potentials inspired by the\nway humans identify and localize parts. We incorporate two relations that were\nshown to be useful to human object identification - containment and attachment\n- into the energy term of the CRF and evaluate their performance on the Pascal\nVOC Parts dataset.

The model is trained jointly in a multi-task learning setting.\nIn this paper, we propose Mixed-Supervised Dual-Network (MSDN), a novel\narchitecture which consists of two separate networks for the detection and\nsegmentation tasks respectively, and a series of connection modules between the\nlayers of the two networks. These connection modules are used to transfer\nuseful information from the auxiliary detection task to help the segmentation\ntask.

    "  We introduce a high-level graphical framework for designing and analysing\nquantum error correcting codes, centred on what we term the coherent parity\ncheck (CPC).

We show how CSS codes form a subset of CPC codes and, more\ngenerally, how to compute stabilizers for a CPC code. As an explicit example of\nthis framework, we give a method for turning almost any pair of classical\n[n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code. Further, we give a simple\ntechnique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and\ndemonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally, we use the\ngraphical tools to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within\nCPC codes. As our framework gives a new tool for constructing small- to\nmedium-sized codes with relatively high code rates, it provides a new source\nfor codes that could be suitable for emerging devices, while its zx-calculus\nfoundations enable natural integration of error correction with graphical\ncompiler toolchains. It also provides a powerful framework for reasoning about\nall stabilizer quantum error correction codes of any size.\n",
    "Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional\nnetworks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling\nlayers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to\npredictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has\nattempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or\nMRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between\nobjects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these\nproblems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The\ndownside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than\ntraditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.\n  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk\nNetwork (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and\nspatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity.\nOur proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and\nsemantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk\nlayer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the\nnetwork. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix\nmultiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks\nand it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard\nback-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional\nparameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces\nan improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.",

So this can be understood as one\napplication of Floer theory and the theory of $\\infty$-categories in basic\ndifferential geometry. We also develop, based on this $\\infty$-categorical\nFukaya theory, some basic new integer valued invariants of smooth manifolds,\ncalled quantum obstruction. On the way we also construct what we call quantum\nMaslov classes, which are higher degree variants of the relative Seidel\nmorphism. This also leads to new applications in Hofer geometry of the space of\nLagrangian equators in $S^2$.\n",

    "Most progress in semantic segmentation reports on daytime images taken under\nfavorable illumination conditions. We instead address the problem of semantic\nsegmentation of nighttime images and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting\ndaytime models to nighttime without using nighttime annotations. Moreover, we\ndesign a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of\nsemantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum\nframework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night via\nlabeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively\ndarker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspondences for the\nreal images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel\nuncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic\nsegmentation, designed for adverse conditions and including image regions\nbeyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion;\n3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which comprises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920\nunlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts\nplus a set of 151 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created\nwith our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark to perform our novel\nevaluation. Experiments show that our guided curriculum adaptation\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real nighttime sets both\nfor standard metrics and our uncertainty-aware metric. Furthermore, our\nuncertainty-aware evaluation reveals that selective invalidation of predictions\ncan lead to better results on data with ambiguous content such as our nighttime\nbenchmark and profit safety-oriented applications which involve invalid inputs.",
    "  Granular materials do not flow homogeneously like fluids when submitted to\nexternal stress,but often form rigid regions that are separated by narrow shear\nbands where the material yields and flows. This shear localization impacts\ntheir apparent rheology, which makes it difficult to infer a constitutive\nbehaviour from conventional rheometric measurements. Moreover, they present a\ndilatant behaviour, which makes their study in classical fixedvolume geometries\ndifficult. These features led to perform extensive studies with inclined plane\nflows, which were of crucial importance for the development and the validation\nof the $\\mu(I)$ rheology. Our aim is to develop a method to characterize\ngranular materials with rheometrical tools. Using unusual rheometry\nmeasurements in an annular shear cell adapted from Boyer et al.

    "Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a\nnatural language expression.

To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective\nby decoupling it into a \"Locate-Then-Segment\" (LTS) scheme. Given a language\nexpression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding\ntarget image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object\nbased on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual\nfeatures to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model\ninteraction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with\nposition prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a\nlight-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly\neffective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+\nand +3.4% on RefCOCOg).

The method partitions a QLF image into segments of uniform texture and\nintensity called superpixels; every superpixel is statistically modeled as a\nrealization of a single 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) whose parameters\nare estimated; the superpixel is then assigned to one of three classes\n(background, biofilm, tooth substratum) based on the training set of data.

In this paper, a novel\napproach for clustering based image segmentation is proposed. Here, we give\nimportance on color space and choose lab for this task. The famous hard\nclustering algorithm K-means is used, but as its performance is dependent on\nchoosing a proper distance measure, so, we go for cosine distance measure. Then\nthe segmented image is filtered with sobel filter. The filtered image is\nanalyzed with marker watershed algorithm to have the final segmented result of\nour original image. The MSE and PSNR values are evaluated to observe the\nperformance.",
    "Class imbalance has emerged as one of the major challenges for medical image\nsegmentation. The model cascade (MC) strategy significantly alleviates the\nclass imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for\ncoarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this\nmethod leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation\namong the models. To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model,\ni.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better\nthan MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net\nintegrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists\nof shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific\nparameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively\noptimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design\nboth an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based\ntraining strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between\ntasks and design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can\nadaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the\ncategory-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing\nmethod is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most\nimpressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing\nset and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed approaches, we\nalso won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating\nteams. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/chenhong-zhou/OM-Net.",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks have driven substantial advancements in\nthe automatic understanding of images. Requiring a large collection of images\nand their associated annotations is one of the main bottlenecks limiting the\nadoption of deep networks. In the task of medical image segmentation, requiring\npixel-level semantic annotations performed by human experts exacerbate this\ndifficulty. This paper proposes a new framework to train a fully convolutional\nsegmentation network from a large set of cheap unreliable annotations and a\nsmall set of expert-level clean annotations. We propose a spatially adaptive\nreweighting approach to treat clean and noisy pixel-level annotations\ncommensurately in the loss function. We deploy a meta-learning approach to\nassign higher importance to pixels whose loss gradient direction is closer to\nthose of clean data. Our experiments on training the network using segmentation\nground truth corrupted with different levels of annotation noise show how\nspatial reweighting improves the robustness of deep networks to noisy\nannotations.",
    "Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely\napplied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively\nand be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a\ngood machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good\nmodel training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the\nperformance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the\nmachine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each\nprocedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training\ndata ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information\nfor the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each\nmodel or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model\ncapture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can\nprovide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible\nlocal optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in\nmachine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the\ndiversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically\nsummarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and\ninference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In\naddition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the\nmachine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing\nimaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation,\nobject detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some\nchallenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some\ndirections in future work.",
    "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a image into different\nregions or groups based on some characteristics like color, texture, motion or\nshape etc. Active contours is a popular variational method for object\nsegmentation in images, in which the user initializes a contour which evolves\nin order to optimize an objective function designed such that the desired\nobject boundary is the optimal solution. Recently, imaging modalities that\nproduce Manifold valued images have come up, for example, DT-MRI images, vector\nfields. The traditional active contour model does not work on such images. In\nthis paper, we generalize the active contour model to work on Manifold valued\nimages. As expected, our algorithm detects regions with similar Manifold values\nin the image. Our algorithm also produces expected results on usual gray-scale\nimages, since these are nothing but trivial examples of Manifold valued images.\nAs another application of our general active contour model, we perform texture\nsegmentation on gray-scale images by first creating an appropriate Manifold\nvalued image. We demonstrate segmentation results for manifold valued images\nand texture images.",
    "Brain extraction is a fundamental step for most brain imaging studies. In\nthis paper, we investigate the problem of skull stripping and propose\ncomplementary segmentation networks (CompNets) to accurately extract the brain\nfrom T1-weighted MRI scans, for both normal and pathological brain images. The\nproposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and\nhave two pathways to learn features from both the brain tissue and its\ncomplementary part located outside of the brain. The complementary pathway\nextracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to\nbrain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training\ndataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on\nthe OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the\ntwo-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is\nverified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its\ninvariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network\ndesign is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation\nproblems with better generalization.",
    "We introduce the concept of derivate-based component-trees for images with an\narbitrary number of channels. The approach is a natural extension of the\nclassical component-tree devoted to gray-scale images. The similar structure\nenables the translation of many gray-level image processing techniques based on\nthe component-tree to hyperspectral and color images. As an example\napplication, we present an image segmentation approach that extracts Maximally\nStable Homogeneous Regions (MSHR). The approach very similar to MSER but can be\napplied to images with an arbitrary number of channels. As opposed to MSER, our\napproach implicitly segments regions with are both lighter and darker than\ntheir background for gray-scale images and can be used in OCR applications\nwhere MSER will fail. We introduce a local flooding-based immersion for the\nderivate-based component-tree construction which is linear in the number of\npixels. In the experiments, we show that the runtime scales favorably with an\nincreasing number of channels and may improve algorithms which build on MSER.",
    "  A distributed adaptive algorithm is proposed to solve a node-specific\nparameter estimation problem where nodes are interested in estimating\nparameters of local interest, parameters of common interest to a subset of\nnodes and parameters of global interest to the whole network. To address the\ndifferent node-specific parameter estimation problems, this novel algorithm\nrelies on a diffusion-based implementation of different Least Mean Squares\n(LMS) algorithms, each associated with the estimation of a specific set of\nlocal, common or global parameters. Coupled with the estimation of the\ndifferent sets of parameters, the implementation of each LMS algorithm is only\nundertaken by the nodes of the network interested in a specific set of local,\ncommon or global parameters. The study of convergence in the mean sense reveals\nthat the proposed algorithm is asymptotically unbiased. Moreover, a\nspatial-temporal energy conservation relation is provided to evaluate the\nsteady-state performance at each node in the mean-square sense. Finally, the\ntheoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed technique are\nvalidated through computer simulations in the context of cooperative spectrum\nsensing in Cognitive Radio networks.\n",
    "  The $A_\\infty$ T-system, also called the octahedron recurrence, is a\ndynamical recurrence relation. It can be realized as mutation in a\ncoefficient-free cluster algebra (Kedem 2008, Di Francesco and Kedem 2009). We\ndefine T-systems with principal coefficients from cluster algebra aspect, and\ngive combinatorial solutions with respect to any valid initial condition in\nterms of partition functions of perfect matchings, non-intersecting paths and\nnetworks. This also provides a solution to other systems with various choices\nof coefficients on T-systems including Speyer's octahedron recurrence (Speyer\n2007), generalized lambda-determinants (Di Francesco 2013) and (higher)\npentagram maps (Schwartz 1992, Ovsienko et al. 2010, Glick 2011, Gekhtman et\nal. 2014).\n",
    "  We characterize Leavitt path algebras which are Rickart, Baer, and Baer\n$*$-rings in terms of the properties of the underlying graph. In order to treat\nnon-unital Leavitt path algebras as well, we generalize these\nannihilator-related properties to locally unital rings and provide a more\ngeneral characterizations of Leavitt path algebras which are locally Rickart,\nlocally Baer, and locally Baer $*$-rings. Leavitt path algebras are also graded\nrings and we formulate the graded versions of these annihilator-related\nproperties and characterize Leavitt path algebras having those properties as\nwell.\n  Our characterizations provide a quick way to generate a wide variety of\nexamples of rings. For example, creating a Baer and not a Baer $*$-ring, a\nRickart $*$-ring which is not Baer, or a Baer and not a Rickart $*$-ring, is\nstraightforward using the graph-theoretic properties from our results. In\naddition, our characterizations showcase more properties which distinguish\nbehavior of Leavitt path algebras from their $C^*$-algebra counterparts. For\nexample, while a graph $C^*$-algebra is Baer (and a Baer $*$-ring) if and only\nif the underlying graph is finite and acyclic, a Leavitt path algebra is Baer\nif and only if the graph is finite and no cycle has an exit, and it is a Baer\n$*$-ring if and only if the graph is a finite disjoint union of graphs which\nare finite and acyclic or loops.\n",
    "We present Convolutional Oriented Boundaries (COB), which produces multiscale\noriented contours and region hierarchies starting from generic image\nclassification Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). COB is computationally\nefficient, because it requires a single CNN forward pass for multi-scale\ncontour detection and it uses a novel sparse boundary representation for\nhierarchical segmentation; it gives a significant leap in performance over the\nstate-of-the-art, and it generalizes very well to unseen categories and\ndatasets. Particularly, we show that learning to estimate not only contour\nstrength but also orientation provides more accurate results. We perform\nextensive experiments for low-level applications on BSDS, PASCAL Context,\nPASCAL Segmentation, and NYUD to evaluate boundary detection performance,\nshowing that COB provides state-of-the-art contours and region hierarchies in\nall datasets. We also evaluate COB on high-level tasks when coupled with\nmultiple pipelines for object proposals, semantic contours, semantic\nsegmentation, and object detection on MS-COCO, SBD, and PASCAL; showing that\nCOB also improves the results for all tasks.",
    "Semi-supervised learning has recently been attracting attention as an\nalternative to fully supervised models that require large pools of labeled\ndata.

    "While making a tremendous impact in various fields, deep neural networks\nusually require large amounts of labeled data for training which are expensive\nto collect in many applications, especially in the medical domain. Unlabeled\ndata, on the other hand, is much more abundant. Semi-supervised learning\ntechniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage\nunlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware\nmulti-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data,\nsuch as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is\nachieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate\ndifferent views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical\n3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In\naddition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate\nthe reliability of each view's prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one\nview requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our\nself-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each\nunlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach\ncan take advantage of unlabeled data during training. We show the effectiveness\nof our proposed semi-supervised method on several public datasets from medical\nimage segmentation tasks (NIH pancreas & LiTS liver tumor dataset). Meanwhile,\na fully-supervised method based on our approach achieved state-of-the-art\nperformances on both the LiTS liver tumor segmentation and the Medical\nSegmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, demonstrating the robustness and value\nof our framework, even when fully supervised training is feasible.",
    "We introduce a novel Deep Learning framework, which quantitatively estimates\nimage segmentation quality without the need for human inspection or labeling.\nWe refer to this method as a Quality Assurance Network -- QANet. Specifically,\ngiven an image and a `proposed' corresponding segmentation, obtained by any\nmethod including manual annotation, the QANet solves a regression problem in\norder to estimate a predefined quality measure with respect to the unknown\nground truth. The QANet is by no means yet another segmentation method.\nInstead, it performs a multi-level, multi-feature comparison of an\nimage-segmentation pair based on a unique network architecture, called the\nRibCage.\n  To demonstrate the strength of the QANet, we addressed the evaluation of\ninstance segmentation using two different datasets from different domains,\nnamely, high throughput live cell microscopy images from the Cell Segmentation\nBenchmark and natural images of plants from the Leaf Segmentation Challenge.\nWhile synthesized segmentations were used to train the QANet, it was tested on\nsegmentations obtained by publicly available methods that participated in the\ndifferent challenges. We show that the QANet accurately estimates the scores of\nthe evaluated segmentations with respect to the hidden ground truth, as\npublished by the challenges' organizers.\n  The code is available at: TBD.",
    "Person re-identification is becoming a hot research for developing both\nmachine learning algorithms and video surveillance applications. The task of\nperson re-identification is to determine which person in a gallery has the same\nidentity to a probe image. This task basically assumes that the subject of the\nprobe image belongs to the gallery, that is, the gallery contains this person.\nHowever, in practical applications such as searching a suspect in a video, this\nassumption is usually not true. In this paper, we consider the open-set person\nre-identification problem, which includes two sub-tasks, detection and\nidentification. The detection sub-task is to determine the presence of the\nprobe subject in the gallery, and the identification sub-task is to determine\nwhich person in the gallery has the same identity as the accepted probe. We\npresent a database collected from a video surveillance setting of 6 cameras,\nwith 200 persons and 7,413 images segmented. Based on this database, we develop\na benchmark protocol for evaluating the performance under the open-set person\nre-identification scenario. Several popular metric learning algorithms for\nperson re-identification have been evaluated as baselines. From the baseline\nperformance, we observe that the open-set person re-identification problem is\nstill largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed.",

    "All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday.\nMoazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US for almost three years. They were detained in the Cuban camp as part of the US-led \"war on terror\". Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after \"intensive and complex discussions\" over security. He said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003. All four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government, Mr Straw said.\nBut he added: \"Once they are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity.\" The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the return of the four detainees. But he said there were still \"serious questions\" both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said the four had been rescued from a \"legal no-man's land\". \"Their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process.\"\nAzmat Begg, father of Moazzam, thanked his lawyers and the British people for the support he had received while campaigning for his son's release. He added: \"If they have done something wrong, of course they should be punished, but if they haven't, they shouldn't have been there.\" Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. She said: \"They should at the outset have said quite clearly to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down. \"They didn't do that. They colluded with it.\" Moazzam Begg's Labour MP Roger Godsiff welcomed his release, but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges. Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said: \"People get released from prison when it's found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. \"I don't see any difference in this case.\" Human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba. Amnesty International has called Camp Delta a \"major human-rights scandal\" and an \"icon of lawlessness\". Both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as \"long overdue\". Civil rights group Liberty said it was \"delighted\" but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.\nDirector Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to \"practise what it preaches\" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars. The US has also announced that 48-year-old Australian Mamdouh Habib, previously accused of terrorist offences, will be released without charge from Camp Delta. Five British detainees released from Guantanamo in March last year were questioned by UK police before being released without charge.",
    "Technology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.\nThe firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.\nCurrently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy \"appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content\". The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.\nThe move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. \"In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past,\" said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. \"The difference is that it is very fragmented,\" he said. \"It's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race\" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsoft's \"Plays for Sure\" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.\nShelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apple's iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. \"Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods,\" she said.\nShe said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. \"It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,\" she said, \"and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.\" Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. \"People want portability,\" she said, \"and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.\" Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. \"Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,\" he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. \"The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on.\"",

    "Greek athletics' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou for missing doping tests.\nThe pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year's Athens Olympics. They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. \"A decision is now expected by around mid-March,\" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos. Kenteris, 31, who won the men's 200m title at the 2000 Sydney Games and Thanou, 30, who won the women's 100m silver medal in Sydney, face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry.

Jol added: \"We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. \"What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it.\n\"We didn't play particularly well but I am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three.\" Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. He said: \"My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. \"It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. \"It's really, really over.

It's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. \"It's not every game you score from the halfway line.\" Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. \"I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game,\" Ferguson told MUTV. \"What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays. \"But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.\n\"Thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. So you wouldn't be wasting a lot of time. \"I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football.\" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. \"When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence,\" said Wenger. \"It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.\"",

    "UK airport operator BAA has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.\nThe comments come a day ahead of a High Court challenge by residents' groups and local councils to the government's White Paper. The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. \"We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,\" a BAA spokesman said.\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. Among other measures, BAA has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near Stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.\nAt Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was \"fundamentally flawed\" and did not follow the proper consultation process. \"We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government White Paper,\" said Stop Stansted Expansion chairman Peter Sanders said. HACAN chairman John Stewart said: \"Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare. \"It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. \"Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. \" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February.",
    "Allan Scott is confident of winning a medal at next week's European Indoor Championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.\nThe 22-year-old Scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the Jose M Cagigal Memorial meeting in Madrid. \"It was definitely a learning curve and I certainly haven't ruled out challenging for a medal next week,\" said the East Kilbride athlete. The race was won by Felipe Vivancos, who equalled the Spanish record.\nSweden's Robert Kronberg was second, with Haiti's Dudley Dorival in third. Scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. He won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first IAAF Indoor Grand Prix circuit final. \"I should have done better than that,\" he said. \"I felt I could have won it.

    "AC Milan defender Jaap Stam says Manchester United \"know they made a mistake\" by selling him in 2001.\nThe sides meet at Old Trafford in the Champions League game on Wednesday and the 32-year-old's Dutchman's presence is sure to add spice to the fixture. \"United made a mistake in selling me,\" Stam told Uefa's Champions magazine. \"I was settled at Manchester United, but they wanted to sell me. If a club want to sell you, there is nothing you can do. You can be sold like cattle.\" Sir Alex Ferguson surprised the football world - and Stam - by selling the Dutchman to Lazio for £16.5m in August 2001. The decision came shortly after Stam claimed in his autobiography that Ferguson had tapped him up when he was at PSV Eindhoven. But Ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. The affair still rankles with the Dutchman.\n\"I was settled at Manchester United, I had even just ordered a new kitchen, but they wanted to sell me,\" he said. \"In what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes? \"Of course, you can refuse to go, but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. I don't agree that players control the game. \"There have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers, but I have turned them down. What's the point?\"\nWednesday's game at Old Trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between United's young attackers Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and Milan's veteran defence of Stam, Paolo Maldini, Cafu and Alessandro Costacurta. Stam says Rooney's teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game. \"We can't all be Wayne Rooneys - at his age I was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone,\" he said. \"Starting late can be a good thing. Some kids who start early get bored. \"I had my youth - having fun, drinking beers, blowing up milk cannisters. It sounds strange but it's a tradition where I grew up in Kampen - and I had done all the things I wanted to do.\"",
    "Dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, Media Labs Europe, is to shut down.\nThe research centre, which was started by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts. Since its opening in 2000, the centre has developed ideas, such as implants for teeth, and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. The centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. In a statement, Media Labs Europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the Irish Government nor the prestigious US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was willing to fund it. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies, in an attempt to regenerate the area.\nAbout three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the Labs' long-term survival. The Labs needed about 10 million euros (US$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. \"In the end, it was too deep and too long a recession,\" said Simon Jones, the Labs' managing director. Ian Pearson, BT's futurologist, told the BBC News website that the closure was a \"real shame\". BT was just one of the companies that had worked with the Labs, looking at RFID tag developments and video conferencing. \"There were a lot of very talented, creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society. \"I have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost.\"\nNoel Dempsey, the government's communications minister, said Mr Ahern had been \"very committed\" to the project. \"He is, I know, very disappointed it has come to this. At the time it seemed to be the right thing to do,\" he said. \"Unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate.\"\nDuring its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. In recent months, 14 patent applications had been filed by the Labs. Many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. Several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. The Human Connectedness group, for example, developed the iBand, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. This information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. Other projects looked at using other human senses, like touch, to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment, or on the body itself. One project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. The Labs, set up in an old Guinness brewery, housed around 100 people, made up of staff, researchers, students, collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. It is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the Labs close on 1 February. According to its latest accounts, Media Lab Europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about US$10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million euros (US$3.3 million).",

    "A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.\nThe drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits. But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.\nApproximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK. Many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.\nNow, GW Pharma's Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. \"We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,\" said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.\nThe UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex's launch in the UK. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p.",
    "The nuclear unit of Russian energy giant Gazprom is reportedly facing a 1bn rouble ($35.7m; £19.1m) back-tax claim for the 2001-2003 period.\nVedomosti newspaper reported that Russian authorities made the demand at the end of last year. The paper added that most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company's export activity. Gazprom, the biggest gas company in the world, took over nuclear fuel giant Atomstroieksport in October 2004. The main project of Atomstroieksport is the building of a nuclear plant in Iran, which has been a source of tension between Russia and the US.\nGazprom is one of the key players in the complex Russian energy market, where the government of Vladimir Putin has made moves to regain state influence over the sector. Gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm Rosneft, the company that eventually acquired Yuganskneftegas, the main unit of embattled oil giant Yukos. Claims for back-taxes was a tool used against Yukos, and led to the enforced sale Yuganskneftegas. Some analysts fear the Kremlin will continue to use these sort of moves to boost the efforts of the state to regain control over strategically important sectors such as oil.",
    "Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen.\nAlan Archibald prodded United ahead in 19 minutes and James Grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later. Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. Tony Bullock in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley. Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless.\nUnited restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. Jason Scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing Crawford and he coolly beat Ryan Esson from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. Grady received a pass from Crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of Esson. The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from Esson to keep out Robson's drive after 62 minutes. The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area.

    "The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.\nPrivate sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\nThe ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\n\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\nA slowdown in the housing market and this year's surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"",
    "UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered £960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.\nIn a speech, he called for action to reach the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. Mr Brown has just returned from a tour of African nations. The £1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health.\nThe chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK's Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday. Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra £0.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation. That could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. As well as pledging £960m over 15 years to the immunisation IFF, Britain urged other donors to contribute.\nIf Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued. Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. War on Want's John Hilary said: \"Compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. \"As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.\"",
    "Belgian brewing giant Inbev has seen its profits soar thanks to its acquisition of Brazil's biggest beer firm Ambev last year.\nInbev, which makes Stella Artois, said pre-tax profits for 2004 rose 56% to 1.16bn euros ($1.5bn; £800m), and said it expected solid growth in 2005. The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",

They also have a good record at the Stade de France, having won their first two games there, in 1999 and 2001. Wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed Italy 38-8 in Rome.\nKevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing.

    "You can now buy \"trusted computers\", but can we really trust the PC vendors, asks technology analyst Bill Thompson.\nIf you have recently bought an IBM ThinkVantage computer, a Dell Optiplex, or one of a whole range of laptops from Toshiba, HP/Compaq or Samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (TPM) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to children's toys. But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. And as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. A big advantage of the TPM is that it is hardware-based.\nAt the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. It might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor.\nHardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. This is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers. As a result we settle for second best. So when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward. After all, if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. And if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. Instead you have to use special software, like HP's ProtectTools or Wave Systems' Embassy. This provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks. Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows, \"Longhorn\". This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the \"Next Generation Secure Computing Base\", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. However there is a downside to the increased security from viruses, spyware and data theft that this will provide.\nBecause the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (DRM) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them. We have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. Users of Apple's iTunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other iTunes users, a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection.\nBut the latest version of iTunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a CD. Another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from Real's Harmony service on your iPod. Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. Similarly, users of TiVo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows, and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it. One wonders whether hardware-based DRM will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. It will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. Once it is unlocked then someone, somewhere, will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. And once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. The efforts going into DRM would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. The record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us, most of the time, will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. They will benefit more by building a market in which I can share songs with my friends, record shows I want to watch later, and burn CDs for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.",
    "Britain has offered to send a company of 120 Gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia, Downing Street said.\nThe deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province. Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.\nHowever a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in Indonesia which the Gurkhas might be able to help with. The spokesman said: \"Following this morning's daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort, the government has formally offered the Indonesian government the assistance of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters. \"This is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean.\"\nIndonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami, with 94,000 of the 140,000 confirmed deaths so far. International Development Minister Gareth Thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of Aceh. \"We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment,\" he said. \"We've also had RAF aircraft flying in equipment which the UN desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in Aceh province as well.\" The offer comes as the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw arrives in Indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast.

    "Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\"",
    "Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was \"out of control\" during the \"wild\" 1960s.\nLucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as \"Precious\" at school. Despite being told he was a \"nutter who died at sea\" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound found out about it last year. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.\nMr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: \"I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead.\" He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a \"set-up\" but he then realised all the dates fitted. \"It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,\" said the Ealing North MP. \"I don't blame Lucy's mother. I was pretty much out of control. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.\"\nMr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since. Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: \"The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. \"We were finishing each other sentences.\" Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.",
    "Japan's box office received a 3.8% boost last year, with ticket sales worth 211bn yen (£1.08bn).\nThe surge was led by animated movie Howl's Moving Castle, which took 20bn yen (£102m) to become the biggest film in Japan in 2004. It is expected to match the 30.7bn yen (£157m) record of Hayao Miyazaki's previous film Spirited Away. Japan Motion Picture Producers figures showed that 170 million cinema admissions were made in Japan in 2004. The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, was the biggest foreign movie hit in Japan last year, taking 13.8bn yen (£70.7m).\nIt was followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Finding Nemo and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The second highest-grossing Japanese film was romantic drama Crying Out Love in the Centre of the World, followed by Be With You and Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation. Japanese films accounted for 37.5% of Japan's box office total last year, with foreign films taking the remaining 62.5%. This represented a 4.5% gain for the proportion of Japanese films in 2004 compared to 2003. The number of Japanese films released rose to 310 in 2004 from 287 the previous year. Sales of movies on DVD and video amounted to 497bn yen (£2.54bn) for the year.",
    "Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be \"the most accessible browser on the market\", according to its authors.\nThe latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"\nAnother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.\nThe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "Stan Lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit Spider-Man movies.\nMany marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stan Lieberman, got a job in Timely Publications, a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, now legally adopted.\nBy the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\nLee's answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee's life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York's skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\n\"Just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee's influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.\nIn 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. His latest project is a superhero based on a real person - Jay J Armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. But his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, The Hulk and Daredevil have all been turned into Hollywood action movies in the last five years. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. It seems Stan Lee is as indestructible as his heroes.",
    "One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.\nYoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan's most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\nMr Tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn't let me use the silk futon, saying it's a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan's troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank's bad loans.",

    "Ulster clung on for a morale-boosting Celtic League win over bottom club Borders at Netherdale on Friday night.\nA late try by Borders substitute Jonny Weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the Scottish side could not complete the fightback. Ulster had led 20-6 with tries from Paul Steinmetz and Bryn Cunningham. But the Irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. Calum MacRae surrendered possession before centre Steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. Substitute Joe Pattison - who had come on for the injured Gareth Morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.\nThe speedy Steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving Adam Larkin an easy conversion. Ally Warnock clawed back three points for Borders, but they were soon hit by another double-blow. First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward. Larkin again added the extras. Even worse was to come for Borders when Larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to Kelly Brown being sin-binned. The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end. And he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory. \"Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time,\" said McCall. \"In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.\"\nMorton, Moffat, MacRae, Hore, Berthinussen, Warnock, Moore, Thomson, Ford, Douglas, Blair, Stewart, Gray, Brown, McEntee.\nKay, Parr, McGee, Rennick, Weston, Millar, Pattison.\nCunningham, Maxwell, Bell, Steinmetz, Howe, Larkin, Campbell, S.

Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March. \"I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen,\" Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday. \"I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago.

    "Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\nTreasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare.\n- Increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60,000 \n - A freeze on petrol duty \n - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \n - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than £60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to £150,000 in February.\nThe Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn.\"\nBut Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\nFor the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a £2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.",
    "Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was \"one of the proudest nights of my career.\"\nThe Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: \"It was a really great night. \"The players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans. \"We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances. For Liverpool, this result is very, very important.\" Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. The Reds scored three second-half goals in a sensational comeback capped by Gerrard's 20-yard drive. He added: \"Steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game.\n\"I have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us. \"I felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters, I cannot thank them enough. \"I want to say thank-you to the supporters, they were magnificent to help us achieve this result.\" Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time. He said: \"I'd be lying if I thought we were going through when we were losing at half-time.\n\"We had a mountain to climb, but we have climbed it and credit to everyone. \"That was one of the best goals I have scored, I caught it sweet, I haven't caught one like that for ages.

    "Music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.\nThe debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser's dream come true and a branding nightmare. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing 'oxygen' for companies that support illegal downloading. \"You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,\" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.\nHe urged people to follow his lead and 'dump' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. 'Networks like eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses,\" it said. But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\nThe reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. \"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,\" he said. \"If you put the legality issues aside, not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience,\" he added. Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical. \"We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. It is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks,\" read a statement from the discount phone firm. It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.\nHowever Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said. \"I would be surprised if these brands didn't have the know-how to prevent this happening,\" he said. At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. \"Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity, including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - Senator John Kerry and President George W. Bush,\" said chief executive Sam Yagan. There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network, he thinks. \"Peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they're most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media,\" he said.",

But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.\n\"You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible,\" says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. \"It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.\" Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.\nMainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing \"export quality\" rap.\nThe web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its \"infant stage\". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. \"He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,\" Millan says. \"He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world.\" Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. \"Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,\" Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.\nBut one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. \"It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now,\" Millan says. \"And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing.\" Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.",
    "More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests.\nTheir biggest worries are not terror threats, but over-regulation, low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.\nGlobal business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandals in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. Across Europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called IFRS. Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.\nAlready, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a \"significant threat\" or \"one of the biggest threats\". But PwC's global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.\nAccording to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: \"One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won't kill your business anymore.\" Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. Mr DiPiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had \"adjusted\" to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.\n - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.",
    "Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said.\nHowl's Moving Castle set a Japanese box office record last week, taking 1.5bn yen (£7.7m) in its first two days. Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. Howl's Moving Castle is based on a children's fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones. It tells the story of an 18-year-old woman who ages dramatically after falling under a witch's spell. She heads to a moving castle kept by Howl, a wizard, and searches for a way to become normal again. A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film \"has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike\". \"We have a good feeling about this film. We saw very good viewer response,\" he added. The film's worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January.",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\nSlower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\nAnd recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\nBusiness groups welcomed the MPC's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"",
    "Aston Villa's Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.\nThe striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. \"Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge,\" said Villa boss David O'Leary. \"I won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea.\" Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because O'Leary had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villa's manager's problems in that department.",
    "The US has pushed Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, under the US Department of Energy. IBM test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The previous top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocked up 35.86. The Top 500 list was announced on Monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world.\nIt is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second.\nOnce completed in 2005, Blue Gene/L will be more powerful than its current prototype. \"Next year with the final Blue Gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat,\" said Erich Strohmaier, one of the co-founders of the Top500 list. It will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers.\nIn second place was Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at the US space agency's (Nasa) Ames Research Center in California. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second (teraflops) in October. It will be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The defeated Japanese contender, the Earth Simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity.\nSince the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.\nThe draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. \"There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,\" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.\nIn December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.",
    "Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet \"rogue-dialling\" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.\nIt has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge. Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. They must warn people earlier about possible fraud, Icstis said.\nPeople who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. Victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: \"Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. \"If my bill goes over the usual £50 a month I want to know about it straight away - I don't want to be told when it's hit £750.\"\nPhone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said. \"We alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers,\" he added.\nTelecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said: \"Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary. \"So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach.\" The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.\nGavin Patterson, group managing director for BT Consumer, said \"We do look at customer's calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. \"We're looking at the moment at whether we can improve this.\" But as BT handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was \"quite a task in itself\", he added. The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. At the moment, it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down.\nI use free anti-virus software (AVG) and free firewall protection (ZoneAlarm). Both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter's love of music sites. How about ISPs informing all customers of such facilities? The responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues.\nIgnorance is and always has been an expensive business.\nDoes any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised? The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ?\nThese diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal MP3s, porn and pirated software. If people didn't visit such sites they'd be considerably less at risk. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? It seems everyone has to be a 'victim' these days!\nPart of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. A secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user's knowledge.\nThese scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. They should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. Or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going?\nWhy don't BT et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request? To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. After you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions, they cannot insist on you paying the bill. To do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. No customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills.\nDisable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. Or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. You would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your PC? Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault!\nI was very impressed with our phone company recently. I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number. Great service. And I got the tickets as well!\nI have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. Three months later another huge bill of over £1,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place. Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.\nI have been scammed of £139. The operator will do nothing about this and, to add insult to injury, I was charged VAT by the government.\nPremium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.\nI know people who have run up large bills, despite being IT-literate. From talking to BT in Belfast, I believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. It's not the fault of phone companies, and at last they are doing something about it.\nIt's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! Not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly.\nI haven't \"fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam\" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. In most cases the user is entirely at fault, which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them.\nMy telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal £3 to £5, to £320. This was because of the scam. They simply billed me. What particularly galls me, over and above having over £300 stolen, is that the supplier and the government (through VAT) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses.\nHow about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted? That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. At least any disputed amount would be limited, far easier for a telecoms operator to write off £20 than it is £750.\nA few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection.\nHow about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date? That should prevent the vast majority of these scams.",
    "Shares in Cairn Energy, a UK oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.\nThe company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable. Cairn's shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year. Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he was \"disappointed\" with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan. Investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a \"significant downgrade of the initial expectation\".\nCairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. The company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; £10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. A spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field's current value.\n\"Cairn refutes the government's position,\" Mr Gammell said. He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - India's state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - and not the contractor. \"We have a pretty strong legal case here,\" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statements though. The shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. \"I think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,\" said analyst Jason Kenney at ING.\nThe disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for Cairn's existing oilfields. The company raised targets for its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in India from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. \"These two fields will provide the core of the future developments in Rajasthan,\" Mr Gammell said. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to South Asia from interests in the US and Europe. Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.",

Sony has billed the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan.

    "Shares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had deepened to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m.\nThe UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and \"operating flaws\" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.",
    "Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan has praised striker Robbie Fowler for his landmark return to form.\nThe 29-year-old, out of favour at City earlier this season, took his Premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in Monday's 3-2 win at Norwich. \"He is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did,\" Keegan said. \"He has worked hard to get back to where he is now.\" The former Liverpool striker, who moved to City in 2003 after a poor stint at Leeds, has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season.\nFowler overtook Les Ferdinand on Tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the Premiership, with 151 goals, and he only trails Alan Shearer (250) and Andy Cole (173). And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward. \"He can get better if we can supply him better,\" added Keegan. \"People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face.\" Fowler's double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards. \"I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington,\" he said. \"His team have got great character, they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm. \"I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership. \"The stadium and the atmosphere is great, it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know.\"",
    "Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, D dal Maso, P Griffen, M Barbini, KP Robertson.\nG Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.\nR McBryde, J Yapp, I Gough, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, K Morgan.\nAndrew Cole (Australia).",
    "Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner.\nGlobally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly \"must-have\" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.\nCamera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.\nMobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.\nImages from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.\nThe exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said.",
    "David Beckham expressed his relief at Real Madrid's passage to the Champions League knockout phase.\nAfter Real's 3-0 win at Roma, the England skipper admitted another season of under-achievement would not be tolerated at the Bernabeu stadium. Beckham said: \"It's expected of Madrid to get through, but it's a relief for the club and players to have won. \"We lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything.\" Real's finish as runners-up in their Champions League group means they cannot face his old club Manchester United in the next round. But Real could be drawn against other Premiership hopefuls, Arsenal or Chelsea, who won their respective groups. \"It's going to be great whoever we play, even if we don't get either of the two English teams.\"",
    "Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.\nThe Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets. The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current £7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.\nFor many deaf people, especially those born deaf, BSL is a first and preferred means of communication.\nUntil now, the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator. \"In the past, I've used textphones but they have problems,\" said Robert Currington who is taking part in the pilot. \"I communicate in BSL; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message.\" \"I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply.\" The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call. \"There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people,\" said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels. \"In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. \"By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group.\"\nOfcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. And new technology, including the Video Relay Service, will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. But a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation. \"Any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider,\" he said. Mr Currington, like many of the UK's 70,000 BSL users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available. \"The relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure,\" he said. \"I can show my emotions more easily in BSL in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls.\"",
    "Pop singer Delta Goodrem has scooped one of the top individual prizes at the first Australian MTV Music Awards.\nThe 21-year-old singer won the award for best female artist, with Australian Idol runner-up Shannon Noll taking the title of best male at the ceremony. Goodrem, known in both Britain and Australia for her role as Nina Tucker in TV soap Neighbours, also performed a duet with boyfriend Brian McFadden. Other winners included Green Day, voted best group, and the Black Eyed Peas. Goodrem, Green Day and the Black Eyed Peas took home two awards each. As well as best female, Goodrem also took home the Pepsi Viewers Choice Award, whilst Green Day bagged the prize for best rock video for American Idiot. The Black Eyed Peas won awards for best R 'n' B video and sexiest video, both for Hey Mama. Local singer and songwriter Missy Higgins took the title of breakthrough artist of the year, with Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian taking the honours for best pop video. The VH1 First Music Award went to Cher honouring her achievements within the music industry. The ceremony was held at the Luna Park fairground in Sydney Harbour and was hosted by the Osbourne family. Artists including Carmen Electra, Missy Higgins, Kelly Osbourne, Green Day, Ja Rule and Natalie Imbruglia gave live performances at the event.",
    "Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.\nInvestors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia's listed firms. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,\" said ABN Amro's Eddie Wong. \"[But] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.\"\nIndia's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\nThailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\nIn the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.\nHowever, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. \"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. \"The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.\nHe told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell said the country's health rates were \"lamentable\" not least because of smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\n - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \n - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \n - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500 \n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \n - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. \n \nMr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.\" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: \"Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.",

    "Carlos Moya described Spain's Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA's challenge in Seville.\nMoya made up for missing Spain's 2000 victory through injury by beating Roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"I have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day,\" said Moya. \"All my energy has been focused on today. \"What I have lived today I do not think I will live again.\" Spain's only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia. And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: \"The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset. \"Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way. It helps me reach my goals if I am obsessed. \"It's really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.\" Spanish captain Jordi Arrese said: \"Charly played a great game. It was his opportunity and he hasn't let us down. \"He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him. \"He had been waiting years to be in this position.\" Spain's victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.\nAged 18 years and 185 days, the Mallorcan became the youngest player to win the Davis Cup. \"What a great way to finish the year,\" said Nadal afterwards. US coach Patrick McEnroe wants Roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. \"I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.\" \"Obviously it's unrealistic to say that we're going to just start playing constantly on clay, with the schedule. \"But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff,\" said McEnroe. Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville's Olympic Stadium. \"It's just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world,\" said the American. \"I had my chances and just didn't convert them. The bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. \"They came out, took care of business and they beat us. It's as simple as that.\"",
    "A senior Tory MP has criticised agriculture department Defra's \"lackadaisical\" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.\nPublic accounts committee chairman Edward Leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The National Audit Office said Defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. But Mr Leigh said the department was \"dragging its heels\".\nThat comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. He also said Defra had been \"dreadfully slow\" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.\nThe outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the UK up to £8bn. \"Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and £40m of invoices remain unpaid,\" Mr Leigh said. Mr Leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an IT system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.\nMinisters had hoped to get £900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. That was because the UK had valued the culled animals at between \"two and three times\" the commission's assessment of their likely market value. National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. On the issue of the unpaid invoices, Sir John said Defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001, \"but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations\".\nMr Leigh said being \"better prepared\" would also help avoid the need for \"mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak\". A Defra spokesman said: \"We welcome the report. It acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak. \"However, the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.\"",
    "Microsoft has entered the desktop search fray, releasing a test version of its tool to find documents, e-mails and other files on a PC hard drive.\nThe beta program only works on PCs running Windows XP or Windows 2000. The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded with firms touting programs that help people find files. Search giant Google launched its desktop search tool in October, while Yahoo is planning to release similar software in January.\n\"Our ambition for search is to provide the ultimate information tool that can find anything you're looking for,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president at Microsoft's MSN internet division. Microsoft's program can be used as a toolbar on the Windows desktop, the Internet Explorer browser and within the Outlook e-mail program. The software giant is coming late to the desktop search arena, competing with a large number of rivals. Google has already released a desktop tool. Yahoo is planning to get into the game in January and AOL is expected to offer desktop searching early next year. Small firms such as Blinkx, Copernic, Enfish X1 Technologies and X-Friend offer tools that catalogue the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer. Apple will release a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to be released with the Tiger operating system.",
    "US hip-hop duo OutKast have capped a year of award glory with three prizes at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.\nThey won best group, best video and best song for hit Hey Ya! after getting five nominations. R&B singer Usher won best male and best album for Confessions, while UK rock band Muse were named best alternative act and best British artists. OutKast will add their awards to the four they won at the US MTV Awards in August and three Grammys in February. Not only was Hey Ya! one of the biggest global hits of last year, but OutKast have been widely acclaimed as one of the most exciting and innovative acts in music. Their double CD album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which saw Andre 3000 and Big Boi each produce one disc, was hailed as the album of 2003 by many critics.\nAndre 3000 thanked fans \"for supporting OutKast throughout the years\". \"We really appreciate it,\" he said. \"I hope you don't get tired of us, but we only do what we do.\" Also competing for best group had been the Beastie Boys, the Black Eyed Peas, D12 and Maroon 5. And Anastacia, Britney Spears, Maroon 5 and Ludacris had been on the shortlist for best song.\nOutKast did lose out in the contest for best album - which was won by Usher, another award favourite. Usher, who performed a duet with Alicia Keys, also beat off competition from Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly and Robbie Williams to take the best male crown. He had four nominations going into the ceremony, with seven artists nominated in three categories.\nEminem's group, D12, were surprise winners in the best hip-hop category, beating the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nelly. Eminem told the crowd: \"D12 finally won an award, thank you very much.\" The rapper opened the show with a performance of his songs Like Toy Soldiers and Just Lose It, for which he was joined on stage by a crowd of children. The Black Eyed Peas - who had a global hit with Where is the Love? - picked up the prize for best pop act, beating Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams and Britney Spears. Spears was named best female, sending a message of thanks on video saying the award \"means so much to me\". Alicia Keys, Anastasia, Avril Lavigne and Beyonce Knowles had featured alongside her in that contest.\nLinkin Park singer Chester Bennington described their prize for best rock band as \"quite an honour\" while Muse said their win for best alternative act was \"a real surprise for us\". Muse were also named best UK and Ireland act, ahead of Franz Ferdinand, Natasha Bedingfield, Jamelia and The Streets. Referring to the fact that winners of 11 of the 12 main awards were from the US, Muse singer Matt Bellamy said: \"There needs to be more European bands.\" The 11th annual awards were hosted by hip-hop artist Xzibit and watched by 6,000 people at the Tor Di Valle arena, plus millions more on TV around the world. The ceremony featured performances from the Beastie Boys, who entered the stage on bicycles and skateboards, No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani being lowered from a giant clock and Nelly doing a duet with Pharrell Williams. MTV also organised a huge open-air concert featuring Anastacia and The Cure outside the Italian capital's ancient Colosseum, with some estimates putting the attendance there at 200,000. Last year's big winner at the MTV Europe Awards, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, was Justin Timberlake, who walked away with three trophies.",

But Dallaglio, who called time on England earlier this year, said: \"I assure you I wouldn't let anyone down. \"I know what it takes and what I have to offer,\" he told the Daily Telegraph. Dallaglio toured South Africa with the Lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to Australia three years ago.\nThe 32-year-old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf-life.

    "The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.\nAgriculture Minister Adamu Bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; £591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.\nCocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. \"People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,\" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. \"The farmers in the village never see any assistance,\" he added.\nAt the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.",
    "Germaine Greer has criticised Celebrity Big Brother's \"bullying\" of housemates after quitting the reality TV show.\nShe said \"superior\" bullying tactics, like making housemates cold and hungry, could encourage playground bullying. She also condemned the \"complete irresponsibility\" of adding Brigitte Nielsen's former mother-in-law Jackie Stallone to the house on Monday. Nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children, Greer said. The feminist writer and broadcaster said Big Brother had behaved \"like a child rather than a parent\" by taunting contestant John McCririck after denying him a cola drink. \"I thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground,\" Greer said. She also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking \"agendas\".\n\"I had no idea who would be in here and it's wrong for me to present myself in the same context as they are.\" Media observers had been surprised by Greer's initial decision to join the third celebrity version of the Channel 4 reality TV show, given that she has written critical articles about the format in the past. As she packed her suitcase to leave the house she told fellow housemates: \"I'm leaving over specific issues, but best for everyone if I don't discuss them. \"I have a problem with decisions, I make them fast and when I make them, I stick to them.\" Greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against Big Brother.\nOther celebrities to walk out of a reality show TV include Sex Pistol John Lydon, former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook and ex-E17 singer Brian Harvey who all left I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Previous Big Brother housemates to leave before their time were Sunita Sharma and Sandy Cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.\nVOTE   Was Germaine Greer right to leave Celebrity Big Brother?   Yes  No   Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion\nHappy Mondays dancer Bez is now 2-1 favourite to win the show, followed by Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie at 5-2 and actor Jeremy Edwards at 4-1. Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush said that the series was still \"wide open\", adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on McCririck slashing his odds to 8-1. DJ Lisa I'Anson is the outsider with odds of 40-1, while Jackie Stallone, who joined the house on Monday, is also one of the less popular housemates at 20-1. The first eviction of the series has now been postponed after Greer's exit unexpectedly reduced the number of competitors. The eight remaining contestants are competing for a £50,000 prize, to be donated to the charity of their choice, if they survive a series of public votes. For every 50p vote cast by viewers by telephone or text during the programme's run, 9p will go to a tsunami charity appeal.",
    "Tony Blair has pledged to \"never, ever, ever\" attack Tory leader Michael Howard over his Jewish beliefs.\nThe prime minister told the Jewish Chronicle: \"If you look at what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically.\" Mr Blair also distanced himself from recent Labour campaign posters featuring Mr Howard, which critics claimed were \"anti-Semitic\". These were \"not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the Jewish community,\" Mr Blair insisted.\nOne poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs. Another pictured the Tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said echoed the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.\nOthers compared the image to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. Labour has since taken the designs of its website, saying members had preferred other designs. During his interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Mr Blair said: \"I've been a very strong supporter of the Jewish community and Israel, and will always be so.\" Pressed on whether he would draw attention to Mr Howard's Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, he replied: \"The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. It's untrue. \"If you look what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically. I would never, ever, ever attack him on that basis.\"\nMr Blair also defended his party's attitude towards the Jewish community, pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the Holocaust Memorial Day. He added that Labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism.\nNeither the Conservatives nor the Liberal Democrats wished to comment on Mr Blair's words. The prime minister was speaking as London's Labour mayor Ken Livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a Jewish reporter from the city's Evening Standard newspaper. Mr Blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter, Oliver Finegold, to a concentration camp guard. Mr Livingstone \"should have withdrawn the comment immediately\" once he realised the journalist was Jewish, said Mr Blair. \"I'm sure that is what in truth he wants to do. Well, he should do it.\" Mr Livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made, and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper. He conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.",
    "Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venice's famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.\nViotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milan's La Scala and the Vienna State Opera. His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet's Manon last week.\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti's last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Vienna State Opera.",
    "Legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the man credited with developing \"total football\", has died aged 77.\nReferred to in the Netherlands as \"the General\", Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Cup - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Germany. However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final. Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971. His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world. The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football. Michels had recently undergone heart surgery and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: \"He was one of the best coaches we had in history.\" The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, named coach of the century by world football's governing body Fifa in 1999, also won five caps for the Netherlands as a bruising centre forward. Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp said: \"He was the man who, together with Cruyff, made Dutch football big.\"",
    "The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.\nStaff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered. US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.\nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand \"what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath\".\nAdding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate \"sickout\". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.\nUS Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.\n\"US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,\" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was \"embarrassed by the situation\" and \"deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,\" The probe will focus on the industry's compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair \"deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline's crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,\" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.",
    "Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else's agenda.\" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can't change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves.\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn't going to be there in New York, that's been taken out of the equation.\" \nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.\"",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.\nRates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August. Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.\nRising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.\n\"Today's no change decision is correct,\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"\nMr Frost added: \"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"\nOn Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\n\"So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.",
    "Germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.\nGross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. It is the nineteenth month in a row that the ECB has not moved borrowing costs. Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.\n\"During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,\" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt. \"If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.\" Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. They have also warned there are more cost cutting measures on the horizon.",
    "Tony Blair has launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a \"ludicrous improbability\".\nThe prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure. Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut £35bn in \"wasteful\" spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts. On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing \"inefficiencies\" which had \"burgeoned\" under Labour. In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.\n\"I believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government.\" Mr Blair added: \"They, the Conservatives have learned nothing.\" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed.\nMr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. \"So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight.\" In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education. \"Everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,\" he said. Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for \"huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy\". \"The public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a Tory government,\" he concluded.\nGordon Brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny. Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be \"distracted or diverted\". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: \"We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.\"\nMr Brown warned that the Tories were planning \"the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto\". Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of \"misrepresenting\" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans. \"He still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools, hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,\" Mr Letwin said. \"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans?\"",
    "British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.\nThe Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. Another 7% said they would not vote at all. The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006. The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.\nBallot papers in the poll will ask: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?\" The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.\nThe treaty was signed by all 25 current EU members in Rome last October and is due to come into force in November 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote. Meanwhile, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\".",
    "Ray Charles, who has won a string of posthumous Grammy Awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.\nHis sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent UK beat and R&B scenes.\nCompared in stature to Elvis Presley by some commentators, Charles' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison. His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the \"devil's\" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.\nWithout Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett. He was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock 'n' roll greats, including I've Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What'd I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael's sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack.\nHe also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of Hank Williams standards such as Your Cheating Heart and You Win Again. More than 40 years after its release, his 1962 ABC album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is still regarded as a classic. His version of Don Gibson's I Can't Stop Loving You topped the pop and R&B charts in the US. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People.\nOn it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a \"brother in every sense of the word\". \"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did,\" he said. Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes. \"I'm quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,\" he told BBC News Online. \"I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever.\"",

Warriors' goalkeeper Murambadoro, who made a name for himself at the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia, helped Bnei Sakhnin overcome Albania's Partizani Tirana 6-1 in the previous round. Murambadoro moved to Israel recently after a brief stint with South African club Hellenic. The club won the Israeli Cup final last season and are based in Sakhnin, which is near Haifa.

    "The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.\nShe told the Guardian newspaper there would be no \"Las Vegas-style\" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes \"a pile of pants\". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. \"You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots,\" Mr Pound told the Today programme. \"I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,\" he said.\nMs Jowell complained of the \"scale of misrepresentation\" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to \"protect children and the vulnerable\" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: \"We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing.\" And continued: \"We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way.\" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.",
    "The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor.\nNew owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers. It also plans to develop a \"worldwide entertainment concept\" with the brand, although details are not yet known. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.\nIn the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.\nThe Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.\nTulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run. The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m.",
    "The 2005 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is a geek's paradise with more than 50,000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event.\nTop gadgets at the show are highlighted in the Innovations Showcase, which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. The BBC News website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005. \n \nOne of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files. The 2.5GB and 5GB circular pocket hard drive from Seagate might help. The external USB drive won a CES best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket. \"It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool,\" said Seagate. \"It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality.\" \"It is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy,\" it said. In the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures. \n \nUniversal Electronics' NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house. It can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. Working with home broadband networks and PCs, the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful, simple interface. Paul Arling, UEI chief, said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. He said the Nevo gave people a simple, single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. The Nevo won two awards at CES, one as a Girl's Best Friend award and another for innovation, design and engineering. The gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (£425). \n \nHotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its Solo Chassis gaming chair. The specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own \"space\". It is compatible with all the major games consoles, DVD players and PCs. \"We found that kids love playing in surround sound,\" said Jay LeBoff from Hotseat. \"We are looking at offering different types of seats, depending on the market success of this one.\" The chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos, with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. And a drinks holder. The chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in April and is expected to cost $399 (£211). \n \nSatellite radio is big business in the US. In the UK, the digital radio technology is known as DAB and works on slightly different technology. Eton Corporation's Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US. DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. \"It is for the risqu&#233; consumer,\" said an Eton spokesperson. \"We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.\" The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. In the US is it expected to cost $250 (£133). \n \nThe average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES. This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years' time. One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo's tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months. A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. \n \nWearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. MPIO's tiny digital USB music players come in an array of fashionable colours, taking a leaf out of the Apple iPod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. Slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. Although the pendant design was launched three months ago, the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends. An even dinkier model, the FY500, comes out in May and will store about 256MB of music. The range of players recently won an International Forum design award 2005.",
    "The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\nJob creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.",
    "The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).\nThe Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal. Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.\nThe Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk.\nBut critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. According to Menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. \"We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,\" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. \"The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today.\"\nMenatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to \"virtually nothing\" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%. According to its Paris lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case. But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. \"Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,\" he said.\nYukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep. He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.",
    "Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nThe fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox.\nThe thrust of this year's show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. \"The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,\" Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website. \"It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.\"\nConsumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. \"This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. \"Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,\" said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the \"democratisation\" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple's iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.\nThe CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft's Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January.",
    "Web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.\nThese online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. The most well-known examples include Iraqi Salam Pax's accounts of the US-led war, former Iranian vice-president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign. There are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last November.\nThe blogging movement has been building up for many years.\nAndrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. \"You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before,\" he says. \"And blogs were a key part of that transformation.\" Among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying \"we are sorry\" for George W Bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio. \"We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas,\" he told the BBC News website. \"But they followed the story, they didn't lead it.\"\nSome parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.\nOthers, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content. \"I don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. It is in transition, as society itself is in transition,\" says Mr Nachison. However, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. \"The one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, it is threatened. And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse,\" says Mr Nachison. \"The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't, that's gone forever.\" \"With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.\"\nIt seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.\nBut the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. Tools such as Google's Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog. US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. But experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay. \"We are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other,\" said Mr Nachison. \"And there's going to be bad that comes with the good.\"",
    "China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.\nThe move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. \"Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,\" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website.\nSome of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.\nThe Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.",
    "European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro.\nThe European single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months. Tacit approval from the White House for the weaker greenback, which could help counteract huge deficits, has helped trigger the move. But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden.\nChina is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar. \"Asia should engage in greater currency flexibility,\" said French finance minister Herve Gaymard, after a meeting with his German counterpart Hans Eichel. Markets responded by pushing the euro lower, in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the G7 industrialised countries next week. Early on Tuesday morning, the dollar had edged higher to 1.3040 euros. The yen, meanwhile, had strengthened to 102.975 against the dollar by 0730 GMT.",
    "Most areas of the US saw their economy continue to expand in December and early January, the US Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book report.\nOf the 12 US regions it identifies for the study, 11 showed stronger economic growth, with only the Cleveland area falling behind with a \"mixed\" rating. Consumer spending was higher in December than November, and festive sales were also up on 2003. The employment picture also improved, the Fed said.\n\"Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest,\" the Beige Book said. \"Several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.\" The report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. \"Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington DC, and New York City, two of the nation's strongest commercial markets,\" the Fed said.",
    "Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.\nMr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair. A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.\nThe event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, Mr Brown replied: \"You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy.\"\nHe refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. Mr Brown later told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\" Downing Street cited that comment when reporters' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe\". Labour's new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign \"which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country\".\nConservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: \"The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H.\" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.\nThe prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a \"scorching\" from MPs.\nOn Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: \"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.\" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked.",
    "Spectators were evacuated from Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and Real Sociedad.\nMore than 70,000 people abandoned the ground with the score at 1-1 and only three minutes left to play. The Basque newspaper Gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. But after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs, the police said that no explosive device had been found.\n\"The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything,\" said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. \"The best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us.\" Madrid midfielder Guti told private Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: \"I have never seen this before and sport should be above it all.\" Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. It is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand.\nIf the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. Initial reports suggested the Basque separatist group ETA may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. The Bernabeu was targeted by ETA on 1 May, 2002, when Madrid were about to play FC Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. A car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club.\nAnelka was quoted in a French newspaper as saying he would like to play in the Champions League for a bigger club. But chairman John Wardle said: \"I've spoken to Nicolas and he's apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the French press. \"We are a big club. Nicolas told me that he agrees with me that we are a big club.\" Wardle was speaking at the club's annual general meeting, where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker. The club still owe French club PSG £5m from the purchase of Anelka in May 2002. He has been linked with a move to Barcelona and Liverpool, and Reds skipper Steven Gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at Anfield. But Wardle added: \"There's been no bids for Nicolas Anelka. No-one has come to me and said I would like to buy Nicolas Anelka.\n\"If a bid comes in for Nicolas Anelka I will speak to the board and then speak to Kevin Keegan. \"If there was a bid and it was a bid of substance and worth taking then between us we'd decide. \"We still owe some money on Nicolas which we have clear out, so it would have to be above that.\" Wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips. He added: \"I've no intention of selling Shaun Wright-Phillips. \"If someone comes with a silly bid I'll have to discuss it. \"But we're not putting him on the shelf to sell. He is the heart and soul of this club and has his heart and sole in this club, and he would be very upset if I put him in the shop window. \"He was an academy kid here, he's just signed a new four-year deal, I don't think he'd do that unless he wanted to play for Manchester City Football Club.\" City recently announced debts of £62m, but Wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the January transfer window. He said: \"Like Kevin I'd like to see some players come in. We've got to see what we can do - whether it's a on a Bosman or not. \"We will try to be creative to generate some funds. But maybe we have to start looking at clubs like Everton and Bolton to see how they have been dealing in the transfer market and do a similar type of thing.\"",
    "The Conservatives would stand up for the \"forgotten majority\", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.\nThe Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values. In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. Labour says the document offers only a return to a \"failed Tory past\". The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.\nCampaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster. Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto. Other chapters will follow in coming weeks.\nIn a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the \"forgotten majority\" made up the backbone of Britain. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. He says in the manifesto foreword: \"They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair.\"\nSaying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue \"down the path of ever rising taxes\". He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall \"bureaucrats\". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. \"The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,\" he says.\nMr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. Mr Howard told BBC News: \"I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep.\" The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. It had nothing to do with putting \"clear blue water\" between himself and his opponents.\nLabour's election slogan will be: \"Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again\". Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of \"launching Thatcherism in instalments\" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September. \"The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust,\" he said.",

Radcliffe's career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the \"Big City\" marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. \"Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,\" said Radcliffe. \"I don't pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. \"I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. \"It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.\"",

    "Film-maker Spike Lee says black representation is stronger than ever in cinema and TV but the true power in entertainment lies behind the camera.\nThe She Hate Me director urged students at his old Atlanta university, Morehouse College, to seek \"gatekeeper positions\" behind the scenes. Lee told them to \"work up the corporate ladder because everybody can't be an actor, everybody can't make a record\". He spoke as part of a discussion panel, then led a retrospective of his films.\nReturning to his old university, which educates only African American students, Lee discussed the challenges facing black people in the entertainment industry. \"Even Denzel (Washington), he's getting $20m a movie. But when it comes time to do a movie, he has to go to one of those gatekeepers,\" Lee said. He told aspiring young film-makers in the audience not to ignore non-traditional routes to getting a movie made, including raising funds independently and releasing films straight to DVD. \"It's a huge market,\" the 47-year-old director said. \"It's not something that should be looked upon as a stepchild.\" Lee has made more than 25 films, including Jungle Fever, Do the Right Thing, Summer of Sam and 1986 hit She's Gotta Have It.",
    "Your computer can now help solve the world's most difficult health and social problems.\nLaunched this week, the World Community Grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems. The donated processor cycles will help the WCG create virtual supercomputers via the net. The idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop PCs. One of the most successful collaboration projects was Seti@home, run by the Search for Extra Terrestrial Life project, which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication.\nAnyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the WGC website. Once installed, the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process, and reports back after completing that task. The first WCG problem being tackled will be the Human Proteome Folding Project, which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold.\nThe subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences, and technology. The body will evaluate proposals from leading research, public and not-for-profit organizations, and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year. Organisations also represented on the board include the United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organisation.\n\"The World Community Grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues,\" said Elain Gallin, program director for medical research at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. \"[It] will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems\", she added. IBM has donated the hardware, software, technical services and expertise to build the basic infrastructure for the grid.

    "Cult British group Portishead have revealed they are writing their third album, their first in eight years.\nFounding member Geoff Barrow told BBC 6 Music the record was well on the way to being completed. \"We're actually into it as we speak. We took some time off for Christmas, but generally we're doing another record,\" Barrow told the digital radio station. News of their album plans comes after confirmation the Bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam's Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.\n\"We've just had our heads down really, we've never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. \"So for us it just seems, even though we haven't played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven't released a record for a long time.\" Portishead will not play any new material at next month's concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Other acts appearing include Liverpool band The Coral and former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Dummy was a critics' favourite in 1994, hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.",
    "Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.\nNew figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor's 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.\nThe economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.\nMr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. \"The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,\" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. \"But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.\"\nConsumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. \"The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,\" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was \"much less alarming\" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which \"are no indication of broad PPI pressure\", were responsible for the increase, he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said \"it is a good bet these increases won't stick\".",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "I'm seriously really upset at second boss vault of stars. For a pure melee rogue it's next to impossible to help with the ice. Since we're pretty squishy as it is if you're standing on ice for more then. 5 seconds you're dead. That's insane but I can dodge and shit so whatever. But the aoe the boss does for ice just randomly hits after putting a red circle around u. Like it's really hard to dodge as I haven't found its timed at all.. Again I can get past that. What I can't get past is the god damn icicles. It's literally impossible as a melee character to help get your team broken out. The ice surrounding it hits insanely hard which is fucked. So I can't be near it. If I so happen to hit one good encounter and break them out it explodes and kills me. So which leaves me with one option tunnel vision. Which does the job  UT only once every 60 seconds. Ice happens every 20 so wtf am I to do. Help if there is a way",
    "I'm not sure if this has been discussed before, but I wanted to bring it up because it's been a while, and it doesn't seem like this issue has been fixed... Every time and I mean, every single time I paricipate, regardless if I finish 1st or 5th, the game takes me to last place. The  moment i reach the finish line it starts loading and keeps loading until everyone has run \"passed\" me and obviously loaded the finish faster than me.... Is this a thing that's meant to be happening? Recently I actually managed to fishish first for the first time and that was only because everyone else had somehow lagged so much behind me that it managed to load before they finished, which is even more purplexing because it means it's not a techical issue that happens all the time. It seems to be more like a bad design choice.... It's extremily frustrating especially since the run itself is also prety frustrating... Is this an issue worth reporting? Is it my wifi??, I mean it's not good, but that's just unfair... I heard someone else here was having the same issue... Is this how the runs go, do you have to finish like a good minute before everyone else to get first place???",
    "As the title says, I got this extreme feeling of wanting to drink women's milk from her tits. I don't know if there is a link for that, but I always want to do it. Even if she's not pregnant. I want to like keeping sucking till some comes out. Maybe, when I have a wife, I'll be sucking on her tits while she's pregnant with our own baby😂. But, right now, I want to just suck on some female's tit for some milk. Maybe, it's because I wasn't able to do it as a child since I was allergic to a lot of things as a baby, so I couldn't. But, now, I'm fine. I don't care if the woman's tits are small or big. I just want to suck them for the milk🤤😂😂. Like a milk vampire🤣. I'll probably get off just by sucking them dry🤤",
    "Not exactly sure where to post this but I thought this was a good one. I recently moved in with my good friend from high school after graduating college in May. Things are good between us, I have known him since middle school and we get along great. The rough thing is I am and have always been jealous of him. He's a tall attractive blonde guy with natural good looks and I am let's say not that. I have come to terms with not being super attractive a long time ago but it is tough to hear him talk about all the girls he rejects or gets with. He just seems happier than I am with his life, I work IT and make a sizeable salary while he works part time with no degree and takes a nap for most of the day. He just seems better than me at all of our shared hobbies. I don't want these feelings to ruin our friendship because he is a good friend but I find myself getting more annoyed at it after moving in. Any advice?",
    "I finally got around to giving my retriever a bath today after a month. He's been itchy these past few days and I figured a bath would help him. He's prone to itchy skin from time to time due to food allergies to environmental allergies. I used a medicated anti-itch shampoo. Just now my brother started grilling me about what I used to bathe him with to what I used to dry him with after, because he was scratching a lot. I agree, he is still scratching, but no more than he was these past few days. I felt slighted cuz I feel like he's indirectly blaming me for making the dog itchy. And today's my birthday and I chose to spend a quiet day at home relaxing and giving my dogs a bath and my day just got ruined by that. He couldn't keep his mouth shut and blame me tomorrow instead...I'm sorry if I sound petty. I just feel sad suddenly..I wanted a day where I could mentally escape and just let my stress go and he completely ruined it and made me feel bad..",
    "I had zero anxiety about getting this shot, I’m a perfectly healthy 26 year old male. However, I had a terrible experience getting the first vaccine. Two minutes after injection, my ears start ringing and I become lightheaded. Next, my vision starts to blacken and become distorted. This intensified for several minutes and I was sweating an insane amount. At this point I’m freaking tf out because I can’t see nor can I hear and I know I’m like the only person having this experience. I did not flag anyone down I just waited in panic hoping my senses would return. After what seemed like a lifetime, but was only 3 minutes, my vision started to return and I suddenly got freezing although I continued to sweat. I left feeling like I just had intercourse against my will, and I also did not tell anyone at the site. I now feel very reluctant to get the 2nd Pfizer dose and am overall just still shocked I had such a terrible experience. Has anyone experienced something similar? Should I have told someone?",
    "I've only dated one person and I loved her with my whole being and she said the same to me but then she cheated on me and whenever we fought she made me feel like it was my fault. We tried to make it work but she kept talking to him behind my back and then she started to distance herself from me broke up with me and immediately fucked around with him saying that she didn't love me anymore when a week before she was saying how much I meant to her. Couple months later they stopped being together and we got together again after talking for a while and she said she started to like me again but then suddenly completely stopped talking to me saying she realised she didn't miss me that much and then blocked me everywhere and seems to be with him again. I don't know what I feel, I feel used, unlovable and worthless. I get massive panic and anxiety remembering everything and I've tried to kill myself three times and two times had to be taken to the hospital. She's the only person that's actually made me feel loved. It's like I have no value or reason to be respected.",
    "I’ll try to be as brief as possible: I was diagnosed with depression around five years ago, when I was only 17, after I tried to commit suicide. As a consequence, I started seeing a therapist while also taking medications. And I actually saw some improvements. However, Everything went downhill Two years ago, when my mother passed away. She was the person I loved the most in the world, and the only one who never made me feel guilty about my problems, so because I am dumb as fuck I just disappeared, never contacted my therapists again, stopped my medications, and moved to London while also taking drugs and leading a very wild life until I almost killed myself. I have now come home for nearly one year, and I made the hard decision of starting therapy again. Last week I went to see a psychiatrist that a friend of mine suggested me to see. After he asked me a few questions whose answers I am not sure he understood since he kept interrupting me, he told me, “Listen to me, kid, you are not sick, or depressed, look at yourself, you are all pretty and dolled up, you are probably just sad because your mum died, you simply need to toughen up and get over it, and you’ll be fine” I Was shocked. I left his office crying, and now I am totally at a loss. Should I give up on therapy? Should I see thiS guy again and give him a second chance? I don’t know what to do.. maybe I am just destined to be miserable.",
    "I am 16 and own a 66/80cc 2 cycle motorized bicycle I recently came across an issue with my carburetor leaking fuel due to the float needle not stopping the flow of gas coming from my tank, therefore, causing the carb to overflow. I did not know how to fix this issue so I installed a flow valve on my fuel line with the flow valve installed I can turn on and off the gas flow to the carb. To fix my issue I turn on the fuel valve thus allowing gas to flow into my carb and once the carb starts to leak I turn it off, now that I have my carb filled with gas I can ride my bike for about 2 to 3 miles before running out of gas in my carb I then fill it back up by turning on my fuel valve. I know this is not the best solution and am probably decreasing my engine's life span but it is all that I came up with. I then thought why not get rid of my gas tank altogether and just oversize my carb's float bowl. Please let me know what you guys think of this idea and if I should patent it or not.",
    "Just something that came to me recently while thinking of the past games I've played. My first console game was My Street for the PS2, which was a fun minigame fest with games like RC Kart, Dodgeball, and Volleyball. I spent so many hours playing My Street with my brothers and even just by myself against the CPUs. And looking at the games I like now, I can say My Street has definitely influenced my preferences. I love games like Mario Party and Mario Kart, and the LittleBigPlanet series was one of my favorites to play and explore all the custom worlds other players made. So I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences with their first video game and their video game preferences.",
    "I started self harm from 6th grade. It got to a point where even if a tiny problem would arise in my life, I would turn towards my razor. It was my guilty pleasure and it turned into an addiction. I couldn't function at that point without this. Fast forward a few years later, and I'm trying to give up my addiction. It isnt easy and 4 to 5 months pass and I get stressed to a point that I cannot handle it and I relapse. I've been thinking that whenever this happens, I look towards my razor, but should I instead go for Vaping? I know my parents will never allow it because I live in a society where mental health is disregarded and mental disorders are not real. But still, if I were to ever get my hands on a vape, should I? I get stressed like that once every 4 5 months so I will not be smoking constantly. However I will still have an exit ready for me. Is it worth it?",

Having  a good enough body but just a smaller chest with inverted nipples , he made me feel little about my 2 insecurities and never enough . I still held on until now but I’ve begun to question is it worth it ? Will someone love me better ?

    "Sooo you know how every character has 3 lives in the Dream Smp? How did they get those 3 lives in the first place? What if the second and third lives are just copies of the FIRST life. You may say this makes no sense but how do you just die and come back all fine with all your memories? Also there is a book called the revive book on the server which only dream possesses and has been used TWICE. Once on Tommy and once on Henry his pet cow. Which shows that the revive book can be used multiple times and the person you used it on gains all their memories after revival. So what if you can revive the \"copies\" or your \"lives\" that you have lost through the revive book basically creating infinite copies of you with all your memories. I mean they have to go some where right? The dead have to go somewhere RIGHT? Comment on this post if you think this theory is viable or its just bs. Also I have another question that is how or who created/found the revive book and gave it to Jschlatt who then gave it to Dream?",

While we were FaceTiming each other, one of her guy friends asked to call her and she asked me if it was ok for her to answer.

    "So I've recently finished The Betrayal of Jimmy and played halfway through Jimmy's Vendetta. The missions are actually awful and some are even ripoffs of the main storyline, the Chinese restaurant shooting for example. Also what does it mean that they are in an alternate timeline? Why does the Mafia universe have different timelines? There also isn't any real lore, which was the strength of the main campaign. Instead we got a few scenes and a character we know very little about and isn't even connected to anything in the main story. The only positive thing to say is that you can explore the open world after the campaign is finished, which is one of my few points of criticism in the main storyline. How can those DLCs be so bad and boring. Should I even try to continue or should I cancel playing them? Also what about Joe's Adventures? Is it also worth playing, or is it as bad as the Jimmy DLCs?",

It's stupid but I thought of using text to speech and just having a static image of my face, but i can't even do that cause the text to speech for my language is horrible.

I really like the owner and wouldn't want to screw him over when the time does come to leave. When accepting a new position, how do you go about the whole two week notice thing? Are employers actually cool with saying,\" Oh I can start in two weeks.\"? It feels to me like an employer might be upset or go with someone else if you can't start soon/immediately, but that may not really be the case in the professional world.

    "Title pretty much explains it all, my cat hates his wet food. I know wet food is much better for cats than the dry stuff, but my little guys just won’t eat it 95% of the time, I put it out and he turns his head an walks away. I’ve tried many many different types of food, and he doesn’t like any of it. He absolutely loves the dry stuff though, sits there and meows and begs for it constantly. After a while of him not eating the wet stuff I usually end up caving and giving him the dry stuff cause, obviously, I don’t want him to starve. I know cats are supposed to eat the wet stuff, that’s where they get most of their fluids from and it’s just better in general, so I’d like to get him to eat it, but he just outright refuses most of the time. On the rare occasion he does eat it, he’ll just eat like half and then leave the rest. What the heck can I do? Should I just give up on the wet stuff and only give him dry? He does have a fancy little water fountain that I see him drinking out of, so I know he isn’t dehydrated, but the lack of eating good food is a bit concerning. He’s about 5 years old, and has kind of always been this way, but recently has gotten worse. I even bought him some special bowls because I was worried it might be whisker fatigue, but that hasn’t helped either. If anybody had any advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",

All I could think of was you. I wish I could take you out for eel sushi, and I’d get your favorite beer, and your favorite bread. It would be so worth it to know you’re eating properly and see the huge smile you get on your face whenever you have your favorite food. We could do something really special together. Now thinking of that money opens up a pit in my stomach I’ve tried to think of something else to use it on but it all pales compared to you.

I hope no one said anything rude. I pray for your safety every day. I can never stop loving you, and I don’t think I’ll ever climb out of this dark pit.

    "So I’ve been learning the basics of forex and when to take trades through IM academy. Basically I know more or less when to take a trade through hourglass using the Cashtrap strategy. It shows you possible trades you could take. The educator says that just using indicators on hourglass you could win 60-70% of your trades. I’ve learned the point system they use to have more confirmations to know whether or not a trade is good to take or not. The problem I’m having is that the educators seem to kinda of repeat themselves over and over and I don’t think I’m learning anything more than what they are saying. They are trying to pass it off as something so simple when in actuality it’s not. I follow the strategy exactly how it was taught but I still seem to lose. I paid a lot of money to learn this and it’s starting to feel like a scam almost. I understand that the market does it’s own thing and you can’t predict right every trade but following everything I’ve been taught I still can’t seem to predict right. I have good and bad days but it’s confusing to know where I should be placing trades and I feel helpless because the educators are on repeat mode every time they go live.",

    "Now I know Victreebel can get swords dance and everything good mainly in postgame of fire red making the only real moveset I want to go with for him is razor leaf, body slam, toxic or acid, and maybe double team or rest. Victreebel isn’t the best in the older gens or maybe he is I have no idea. But I’d love to know what you think maybe I can give him other moves I’m deciding on either him or exeggutor and I really don’t know what else to use the rest of my team is gonna be Charizard, Primeape, Lapras, Raichu, and Nidoking and Victreebel is getting the 6th spot if I can find him viable, this is for ingame only also and I have access to get a bellsprout cause my brother has leaf green, I’d love to hear what you guys think and thanks.",
    "my best friend would always comment on my moms ass, tits, etc. he would always say how he fucks her yk the usual shit. until i came home early from playing basketball and i see my best friends car in the driveway. i go inside and it’s quiet but my moms home bc of covid. i go into her room to ask why he’s here to see my childhood best friend fucking my mom. she hurried for her clothes and that’s when i saw his dick. it had to have been at least 9 inches while i’m only 3 inches. while my moms rushing for clothes he tells her to stop and that he wants to see what’s in my pants. my mom didn’t say anything and neither did i do he came over and choked me against the wall and dropped my pants. he made my own mom take a picture or our dicks next to each other and then told me he wants to keep fuckign my mom. obviously i said no and we were going back and forth until he just holds me down and ties me up with bedsheets. he forced me to watch him fuck my own mom. she loves every part of it and was so surprised to see how much bigger his dick was",
    "I just watched fragment of trash taste how they lambasted Kazuya for that thing with not running after Mizuhara and i m wondering... I know when i started reading i felt he was pain in the ass but kinda understand where all those things he did come from and just gave him some pass. His pervert side is still annoying but i feel like it is author trying to be  funny but failing mostly. Otherwise he is really great later on even this situation when he said sorry to Mizuhara for not running after her made me sad for the guy and later on there where more moments where i really felt some emotions after him trying to open himself or trying to be brave. Is it really that bad in anime or am i just incel feeling bad for other incel ? I felt really down in my life for quite some time so i relate to characters with low self esteem especially this low like Kazuya, because it's uplifting when he tries to fight for himself out there.",
    "Ages ago it has its battery changed; after it wouldn’t turn on with the battery plugged in nor would the battery take any charge. It has done little other than sit since unused since then. Recently I decided I’d try using it so I readied a bootable El Capitan usb as it’s hard drive is completely blank, but the MacBook wouldn’t turn on. I eventually found out that holding down the power button for 10 seconds and then plugging it in continuing to hold down the power button for another 10 seconds. When it does turn on the fans are full blast and whether it’s to El Capitan install, High Sierra install, internet recovery, or the hard drive from a know working MacBook it will only make it a little past halfway before shutting off and coming back on again only to repeat. If it is turned off anyway other than when it shuts itself off the 20 second power button thing has to be done again. I’ve tried an nvram/pram reset and the option+command+shift+power to no avail. On the inside there’s no evidence of water damage. I’ve been trying at it for two days now and I’m out of ideas as to what the problem could be.",
    "I feel so incredibly anxious. I can’t sit still. After a rollercoaster emotionally abusive relationship that lasted two years and after 1 year sharing an apartment together, I moved across the country for a while. After a month of not seeing him, I’m back. I’m seeing him tonight. The level of anxiety I feel is unreal. I can’t sit still for more than a few moments without feeling nauseated with unease. We wanted to meet up to get closure for everything that happened, but it was a toxic relationship. He begged for me back a week ago and has been standoffish the last few days. He told me he’s incredibly depressed and wants to want to seek help, but it seems that he won’t. He’s erratic in his communication and seemingly his feelings toward me. He says he feels like it’s going to be weird to see each other and I feel the same, to an extent. Despite everything he’s done and everything that’s happened, I miss him and am excited to see him. I don’t know whether or not that’s wrong.. people who are close to me tell me that I shouldn’t see him at all. I can’t help but feel drawn to him, even if it’s for the last time. Advice on how to handle this situation?",
    "Started a new job, its kinda scary not physically knowing who your teammates are. I mean chat chat pero iba pa din like 1st day at sabay-sabay kayo kakain, tatawa kayo pag lahat kayo nahihirapan, etc. It kinda feels like on your own dba. Parang zoom meetings feel awkward din, saglint lng and like its kinda different din like having the vibe of someone working beside you and making chikka. Its awkward just inviting people na \"hey magzoom tayo para lng may presensya\" and it doesnt feel the same. Anyone who can give advice on how to handle this scenario? I guess its the feeling of uneasiness din sa new role, new company and before pandemic, hadn't realize the value of having people starting with you.",
    "Their motivation is pretty weak to be honest and Marvel's attempt to connect their motivation with \"The Blip\" makes absolutely zero sense either.  Like what motivated them to do what they do in the show? We got a glimpse of it like wanting the life before the blip to come back and \"blip refugees\". Why are the blip refugees struggling exactly? Why the life after the blip sucks even more? I'm not saying that every single question have to be answered ,but the way they try to make the audience sympathize with the Flagsmashers just doesn't work. Maybe they could have showed us a small glimp of the struggles people faced after the blip and the struggles the blip refugees are going through ,but none of it was hinted properly at all. It was just \"bad\" things that's happening and we're supposed to relate with that suddenly.",
    "I am like 90% sure Isayama was made to make the ending more digestable. Why, you ask? All we have to do is look at the Season 2 ED. EVERYTHING is a reference there, EVEN THE FUCKING BABY is in there. Do you know what was in there that we've never seen? The mass of people wandering away. Those surely had to be the collossals turning back. This in itself is not the reason why many people dislike the ending, but I can surely say that some things were fucked with, and I doubt that that was the only one. I can even imagine some executive telling him literally after 138 that \"yeah man your shits fucked up no way we can have those characters die. figure it out\" Jean and Connie were brought back without even them getting brought back. They just kind of.. appeared? I don't know, maybe it's just my last dose of copium, but I am convinced that this was not that was envisioned.",
    "I am about a month into this hobby. I got myself a giant trance x. I walk with a cane do to a hip injury I received from a motorcycle accident when I was younger. Over the last year I have lost 168 lbs and wanted to strengthen my leg muscles before my hip replacement surgery. I told my doc I want you to have to work to get to my hip after I put on all this muscles lol. My legs were so weak. I started riding a beach cruiser about 8 months ago and was able to build up to a 20 mile ride, but I was limited on where I could go because of not having gears. Now I have open up so many doors with this bike. Me and my brother did our first climb two days ago. Holy crap that was one hell of a workout. It is a 14 mile ride with elevation gains of 2200 feet. We were only able to do like four miles with a gain of like 500 feet. The ride down just from that far up the hill got me hooked. This hill now has become my unfinished quest and i will beat it. It feels so good to have purpose again in my life and to seek out these challenges that are hard instead of running away from the hard things like I use to do.",
    "Title basically. I have an iPod Mini I recently upgraded, swapping out the 4 gig hard drive for a much larger compactflash card and it's eventual home will be a little cabin I'm building on a plot of land out in the middle of nowhere. It's being stuffed full of audiobooks and radio plays, including from my sizable Audible collection. At the moment I'm downloading my books, converting to MP3, splitting into chapters and then putting on the mini. This is mostly automated for me with the toolchain I've put together with shell scripts, but still takes a pretty long time. The mini is compatible with Audible formats 2, 3 and 4 which would greatly simplify things into drag and drop but for the life of me I can't get audible's servers to spit out the old formats. Is it impossible or is there a trick I'm missing?",
    "Just got home from a visit with my GI doc. Wasn’t even a visit, it was more of a lecture. He canceled my GES. I’ve been waiting for it for so long. He says that he found that I am lactose intolerant and that must be what is causing my symptoms. I was on a lactose free diet and I saw no fucking difference. Lactose intolerance isn’t nausea every single moment of your life. Lactose intolerance isn’t eating and vomiting the undigested food a couple hours later. He didn’t even give a shit about how much weight I’ve lost. I was so fucking overweight before my symptoms and now I can barely get it above 105 lbs. I’m not fucking crazy. I went to that appointment so bloated that I looked pregnant. Nobody listens. My mom doesn’t care. My dads a doctor and even HE won’t listen to me. He says he doesn’t want me on gut stimulators because I’m under 18 and they cause abdominal pain. Abdominal pain? That’s my middle name at this point. My mom is calling my primary doctor now to adjust my anxiety meds because I broke down when we left that appointment. Wanna know why I’m anxious and depressed? BECAUSE OF THIS FUCKING HEALTH CONDITION. GOD DAMN IT. What the hell do I do? Do I need to say my symptoms in French since nobody seems to understand them in English? Why won’t anyone listen to me?😭",
    "I know that I am overly quiet in social situations, and that it’s because a lot of the time I overthink anything I might say. Most of the time it keeps me from saying anything at all. I feel like it makes people think I’m stuck up or unapproachable. People tend to fill in the blanks if you know what I mean. A lot of people will say I should try not to think so much and just say the first thing that comes to mind, but the thing is on those rare occasions where I don’t overthink too much and start to get comfortable so I actually talk to people I feel like a lot of the time I’m awkward, and in ways I can’t always quite put my finger on either. Like I put my foot in my mouth or overshare or just say odd things that people don’t know how to respond to. It all makes me cringe and go back into that overthinking mode and I feel socially inept. It makes me want to cry and be a hermit. I don’t know what I’m looking for here, maybe I just need to vent. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "So this post is going to be somewhat of a jumbled mess as I dictated in my car as I’m driving from my iPhone but I just had a thought after reading some news about student loan forgiveness and with all the money that’s been spent through the government I think there’s an agenda in motion to cancel Fiat currency and the future is going to be only a Cryptocurrency somewhat like China just did. the United States will probably create its own so I don’t know where that leaves all the currencies that we have now but I think it’s important that we invest as much as we can into these currency’s now. I can see the US dollar becoming worthless and these things come quicker than we realize it could happen within a year could happen within 10 years we don’t know my advice to everybody is put everything that you feel comfortable putting in the crypto currencies as you can. And thank you for reading this if you did. And please comment your thoughts",
    "Honestly, the storyline I'm most worried about in the show is the shipwreck storyline with Matthias and Nina. All the other storylines in the show, including the crows, tie in to Alina's story, and are all connected. But I feel like, especially for new viewers, the Helnik storyline is just gonna feel like a random shipwreck in a random part of the world with two random characters who we don't really care about and have nothing to do with the main storyline with Alina. I just feel like it will feel a bit random and disconnected to the rest of the plot, especially considering all the other plots are connected. Maybe they have come up with a sensible way to believably tie them together, but even then it doesn't really look like nina and matthias is gonna interact with or even meet any of the other characters, unless it's just one scene at the beginning or the ending. I think I am most worried about the fact that new viewers are gonna be confused and not really care about the storyline at all.",

Because of this I have found cooking and cleaning very difficult, almost impossible.  This had lead to me needing to order out almost every meal. Funds are dwindling and I'm getting extremely overwhelmed. I've been finding it very difficult to even keep trying. I've been in too much pain to effectively  take care of myself.

I feel like I can't even talk to my partner because they keep recommending therapy and while I know they aren't my therapist sometimes I just need to talk to someone. I moved to a new state in order to be with my partner a few years ago and have struggled hard with making new friends, got a better paying but less satisfying job, we're even expecting our first kid soon.

    "I don't want to be like this - I'm too old for this shit. I don't want to spend the rest of my life posting about my heartaches. I don't romanticize heartbreaks. I dont intentionally torture myself with thoughts of you, they just come to me - like a thief in the night, leaving me robbed and helpless. There's nothing sweet about this and I'm far too logical for this. I don't enjoy wracking my brain, trying to find words that would best describe how I feel - and every time failing because no words could really come close to how gut wrenching, soul destroying this is. I put into words how I feel because supposedly it helps - I haven't seen any result yet at all. There's only one thing that would help me - and that only comprises of three letters - YOU. I'm so fed up with myself. I have no fucking illusions, no grandiose dreams of getting back together, of a happily ever after. I've lived in the fairy tale we have created long enough - and I'm living now my reality. I'm tired to my bones of feeling this way...I just want to move on. I'm not harboring any negative thoughts about you or about myself - no blaming, it is what it is. Some relationships are not meant to last, and some people are not meant to be together. That is life and I'm well too aware of it. But fuuuuuck, the pain. I just want it to stop. Now. Not when I'm six feet under the ground and I wouldn't give a fuck at all. I don't want to continue going through this anymore. I have accepted that we are not meant to be. I'm not angry about that. Just please, let me be free of this pain. Cause I just can't anymore.",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country. Personally, I think the trans-atlantic alliance must end and we should go back into isolationism.",

    "When my son was seven I took him to Dover Castle.  Neither he or I were aware of specific hauntings at the castle prior to the visit.  After a great day we returned home.  On tucking my son up in bed that night we chatted about the day and he asked me about a woman he’d seen dressed in a long red dress.  I thought it odd, although he was clearly not scared but more intrigued by her enough to ask me who she was.    I had not seen anyone matching the description although had been with my son throughout the day.   I thought nothing about it until a day or two later when, out of general curiosity I googled the castle and discovered that it is famous for being haunted with several ghosts one of which was a lady in a long red dress exactly where my son had seen her.",

I just tried another movie tonight and I had it set to direct stream, but it failed converting again. I had the mode set to auto, so I changed it to force and it loaded up super fast but said it couldn't detect any audio. So it played the direct stream 35mbps 4k beautifully, but without sound.

The thing is when I pee I don’t feel any burning it comes out normally. But after I pee i still feel the pain maybe even worse. It also feels like I have to pee when I don’t. It just feels all inflamed and burning inside of there. It’s been going on for I’d say 5-6 days now. The worse part is I’m on vacation and dealing with this sucks, I can’t even relax on vacation. I’ve had a hard time sleeping too. I made a doctors appointment for Monday. I’m just trying to see if anyone else experienced these symptoms.  It was worse when I took CBD too thought it would help. I’ve also been peeing a lot since this started too I guess my body is trying to flush this out if it is something.",

The recent 1.2 patch made it so you can make the “key item” icon on Johnny’s gear disappear by collecting all of his stuff and getting the Breathtaking achievement. Thing is if you decide to upgrade his gear from rare to epic then the epic version will have the “key item” icon and you won’t be able to get rid of them. Same thing if you upgrade the epic version to legendary. What you need to do is upgrade the rare version into epic then epic version into legendary before you get his pistol. Once you get the pistol all three versions in your inventory will have the “key item” icon removed from them. Then you’ll be able to delete them or store them in your stash or do whatever you want with them.",
    "I do group therapy with my family because my family is screwed up especially my dad and brother and every session ends with them blaming me for something and trying to convince the therapist I'm horrible. Recently they talked about how I dont enjoy doing chores, I dont do them because i score very high in school and it's very stressful. My therapist says they need to control me more. Keep in mind this is the person that's supposed to help me. Fast forward a week I pass my learners permit test, this day is probaly the only day I've been genuinely happy in about a month, and when I come home my dad just tells me to take out the trash. I tell him \" I'm eating right now, I'll take it out when I'm done eating\" and my dad is very childish and he likes control. So of course being the lazy fat and impatient dad he is, he says \"no do it right now\" so I say \"listen, i just got my permit, you are not going to ruin this day for me.\" And he says \"take it out by 5 30\". So I take it out because I'm not lazy like him, and now I'm mad and stressed out when I should be happy. I havent been happy for like 2 months and he ruins it. Take your own trash out you imbecile. Time to wait 2 more months to be happy, who knows if he will ruin it that time too.",
    "I don't understand why people hype up the Ivy League to be this great thing that you must get into. I personally didn't apply to any. Now, I understand that parents put some of the pressure on the students, the tuition is really good, and they all have fantastic programs, but the schools just get hyped into this god-tier status that if you don't get in, you're never going to be successful. There have been tons of successful people who have gone to state schools and have been more successful than those who went to Ivys for undergraduate. If you don't believe me, do a quick google search. Furthermore, jobs don't care about where you went to undergraduate. They care about what experience you have. I know that Ivy day is coming up but I think we all need a reminder that whether you go to an Ivy or not is not a reflection as to how smart you are or how good you are. Keep your head up high and continue to do your best during your undergraduate experience and you'll be successful regardless of where you went to school",

For the past three years or so, I have been consistently getting choppy haircuts with chunky layers that need to be fixed every time. I just got a haircut yesterday. The top 2/3 of my hair looks fine, but the bottom third looks about half as thick and very choppy and bizarre. I’m going to have to cut it again. I haven’t been able to grow my hair past shoulder length because this keeps happening. There’s no way that I just have bad luck picking hair dressers. It has to be something about my hair causing this, I just can’t for the life of me figure out why or how. Does anyone have any ideas at all? Has anyone else experienced this?",
    "In my opinion Charmx isn’t leaving. The fact that it still shows that he still has 2.4K videos is pretty fishy, they could all possibly be unlisted or maybe deleted which could suck for him. My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

    "Whilst playing in the Great War mod I was loosing a war of attrition. The allies had pushed me back almost to Berlin but then I mounted a massive counter attack on the Eastern front and reached all the way to Stalingrad which capitulated Russia. I was pleased to have so much land after such a long war. However, my happiness was short lived as I was slapped in the face by the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. But still I mounted a western front counter attack and pushed the allies back to the Benelux border. My attacks were green across the bord and the troops I had spent the last year preparing were making short work of the entente. But then suddenly out of nowhere I get hit by the Versailles treaty.

    "Hey everyone, what are some tips and advice on how to make your body smell extremely good 24/7? I would like recommendations from diets to deodorants to which fabric softener or detergent to use to wash your clothes, which product to use on your face and hair, which body wash, body lotions, body oils, perfume, showering technique, dental hygeine, flossing technique, anything, to use to make your body and mouth smell like heaven. I can make my hair smell really good, I use Amike Soulfood nourishing hair mask, Morrocanoil leave-in conditioner, Morrocanoil treatment, and Briogeo Anti-Frizz heat protectant. I have been complimented on the smell of my hair multiple times but I do not know how to make my body smell very good. Does anyone have any good body wash recommendations, body lotions, body oils, or perfumes to make yourself smell really good? Has anyone been complimented on smelling good all the time, and if so, what do you use? I have heard the Yves Saint Lauren perfume is amazing and I will buy that, but I was also thinking of just using something to smell good all the time naturally, not exactly with perfumes all the time. And by smelling good, I mean I really want people to constantly compliment me on how good I smell when they get closer, I am not really talking about just preventing from smelling bad or smelling neutral, or decent, but just smelling really good. Let me know, thank you.",
    "So last night my roommates, some friends, and I were having a good time having a bonfire. I decided to get wonky for the social gathering so I kept going back inside to my room to snort more ket. We have like 5 snakes and my roommate was showing one of our guests her snakes but one of them nudged the heat lamp keeping them warm when they were going back outside to the fire. Some time passes and I decided to go inside and snort some more ket. But when I go inside it smelled like something was burning but I didn't think much of it since we were having a bon fire. I proceeded to my room until I got near the reptile room and saw a bunch of smoke in that area. I freaked out and looked for the source and saw it had something to do with the heat lamp. I was so wonked I really didn't know what was starting to burn and catch on fire but I immediately ran back outside to inform my roommates something was catching on fire. They come inside and fixed the situation. Man, that was a close call. Thank god for my ketamine addiction and that I decided to get wonky af that night. I could've not have a place to live today if I didn't want to go back inside to continue the wonk. I just felt the need to share this with everyone. Thank you guys for listening to my experience last night. That was pretty scary when I finally thought about it.",
    "Our relationship is already stressed, and she is going through that phase everyone goes through where if someone dares correct her or politely inform her that she is making a mistake she blows up. I’ve done everything I can, and managed to find a ten gallon. It used to be in a five gallon, and a ten gallon was all I could find for her considering I’m broke from my own gosh and she wasn’t putting any effort into it. She comes to me with her fish problems but doesn’t listen to my advice when she hasn’t asked for it in regards to her fish’ safety. She told me a couple minutes ago that his stomach was looking a little big, he hasnt been swimming around much any more, and he isn’t eating as much/ at all. Tomorrow morning I convinced her to put him into a smaller container for a bit so I can get a good look at him and take a picture. Any suggestions?",
    "I’m still struggling in some aspects of the therapy. I’ve got the Amara View mask, which is comfortable enough. No problems falling asleep. Not snoring, which is great. AHI is generally between 4 and 8 while I can keep it on. But if the thing, Philips Dreamstation, goes 12 or over, i cannot breath out and end up almost choking on my own air. Doesn’t happen regularly. Maybe 2x in the last 2 weeks. I get a good, solid 3 hours after I initially fall asleep. After that, i’m usually up like at least 2 or 3 times and, recently, take the thing off after i hit about 4.5-5 hours just to get some sort of sleep. I don’t THINK i’m having claustrophobia issues. I’ve never had issues with claustrophobia in any other situations. I’m struggling to function during the day more now than before i started on the CPAP. I don’t know. I’m venting more than anything.",
    "Those of you in condo's and detached homes in Victoria, That have mini split heat pumps. How loud is your compressor unit outdoor? We had a two head unit mini split installed in August and it is loud as heck. The installer came out multiple times. Of course every time they came the unit wouldn't make the noise. It happens more at night and when it's really cold. I know they make noise but I feel like the amount of noise this unit makes is substantially louder than it should be. A friend of ours had one put in by the same installer. And his is whisper quite. I'm at my wits end on what to do. The installer keeps saying it's normal noise. But when the tv volume had to be turned up to drown out the noise of the outdoor unit. I feel like that's excessive.",
    "It gives me extreme anxiety when people come toward me for a hug or high-five. This is because everyone seems to do hugs or high-fives differently. In the milliseconds before someone hugs me, I think through how I will have to hold my arms, if they are going one arm up and one down or both up or both down or a side hug. For high-fives, it’s the same issue. Some people will grab your hand when you high-five, others have a weird pull you in for a hug thing, some grab your hand after slapping it and shake it or something. Anytime someone high-fives me, they look at me as if I am retarded when I try for a normal high-five because I don’t know what sort of weird-ass high-five they will try for. Sorry this is so long.",
    "I bought my first truck recently. It belonged to my dad’s boss who pretty much babies his vehicles. Only he let this sit for about a year. I got a pretty good deal on it considering which I wouldn’t normally do if my dad didn’t trust the guy. I couldn’t take it home at first because we found a fuel line leak. We repaired it and we jumped it and it ran really good. Until it died on an exit ramp. We got it towed home and it hasn’t started since. We’ve replaced the batter and now the ignition coil. It will turn over but it just won’t start. It’s an electrical problem because I’m not getting sparks from the ignition coil, hence the replacement. But still nothing. If I can’t get it fixed, the guy said he’ll take it back and give me my money back but damn I really want this damn thing to start. I hate that I can’t drive it or do anything with it",

    "I think when modeling for games the modifier aspect and the non destructive workflow puts blender above most 3D packages in this regard. One thing that is essential though when working with a high to low poly workflow is keeping the geometry relatively simple and be able to adjust it without having edgeloops around every corner. Maya's crease set tool was very good at that and I wonder why someone has not released an addon for that yet, I would really pay any amount for such tool since it would speed my workflow a lot. Don't tell me that you can do this using vertex groups cause it just doesn't make the cut, is too messy and the values of the crease get lost when you start to have a more complex model. Maybe it is too difficult to create? I would be happy to fund it. Let me know what you think.",
    "Signed up for Fraser’s HWPO app and was looking forward to it but it’s been a complete disappointment so far. Didn’t get a password email like the first email today said I would. Figured out I could do a password reset and get into the app. Got into the app and didn’t have the program in there. Checked back a bit later and it had shown up so got my hopes up that issues were over. Not so much. App is SUPER slow, nothing will load and all I can get to is a list of “Day 1, Day2, etc” if I click them it just spins and loads. Has been a complete let down so far. I’ve used various fitness apps before and all of them have been pretty decent and seem to be built on a pre-canned template app that whatever celeb throws their name on and was expecting similar for this one but not so much. This is like a freshman programming class tried to do a school project and failed at it hard. Anyone else get different results?",
    "Like two months ago I was using my newly acquired prostate vibrator, so to get things into perspective I was laying in my back inside my bed just chilling with the vibrator in while I tried to meditate and then suddenly, out of fucking nowhere a huge wave from my prostate flew through my whole body, it was so fucking pleasurable and only took like 4 seconds it even made me open my mouth as if I was about to moan, never had anything like it again, no cum came out it was just so good, after those pleasurable 4 seconds I thought \"I have no idea of what the fuck that was but I loved it\", that shit is the only reason I am still into prostate play cause after that until now I have felt nothing from it again not even a p wave I think, am I doing something wrong, and for God's sake someone tell me what the fuck that was",
    "One time I went to a party in Dahlonega, we started out at Taco Mac getting really drunk. I started getting really frisky so the two guys I was there with took me out back to where their truck was parked, turn down the music in there truck, and we started our own party. Of course I started taking my clothes off and dancing for everybody that had gathered. I brought one guy up on the bed of the truck with me and started putting his hands all over me. Eventually he started touching me and feeling me up, he took off my pants and started finger me in front of everybody. And his buddy got up on the truck push me down on my knees and stuck its dick in my mouth. They put me down on all fours and spit roasted me for a while... Then other people started climbing on the truck, a few other women took off their clothes and we all started sucking each other. Mostly us girls and the guys watching sucking on each other's tits, licking each other's pussy, trying to fit as many fingers as we could inside each other. But some guys were still up in the truck fucking us and putting bottles in us, and other things they were finding, not quite sure what was inside me at some points. But of course someone had to spoil the fun and eventually the cops showed and threatened to start arresting people if we didn’t pack it up.",
    "So recently all my purchased cards vanished from the client. I believe this had something to do with unlinking my original metamask address. I did this through support after linking my hardware wallet, as nothing has been minted yet I assumed all the cards would be minted to my new address. Apparently I was wrong, support didnt answer my questions about if unlinking my old address would have any negative side effects, they just did it and closed the case. They wont reply now the cards are gone and still havent replied after I made a new support ticket. I have relinked the old address to see if that would bring them back, but nope. Some people on here suggested I try the discord but that hasnt worked either. Starting to feel like I'm up shit creek without a paddle here.",
    "For a couple years now my 2009 v star 1100 was having trouble starting.  I would have to roll on the throttle slightly for it to start.  I recently found out that is a horrible thing to do on the v star.  All my research led me to find out that the tps sensor was the culprit.  To be in spec the tps sensor ohms have to be between 500 and 800.  Mine at its lowest setting was 1150.  I read multiple posts where people paid $165 for a new sensor and its was still out of spec.  The bracket that the sensor screws into is big enough to drill new holes right next to the existing ones so that the sensor can turn more and be within the proper range.  I drilled the new holes and tapped it with an M4 tap with 0.75 pitch.  It worked and the hard starting is fixed.nice to get the old girl back to normal.  I love the V star 1100 but pretty said that Yamaha made the sensor out of spec.",
    "Usually I play on PS4, but I still own my PS3 and recently installed it in the living room so my roommate and I could use it as a dvd player and we could play some old games together. However, when I wanted to let her play Journey, I found out the game disappeared from my ps3, I also cannot find it in my list of purchased games in my PS account either. The only evidence I have of ever owning the game on ps3 is a confirmation e-mail from the PS store when I bought it years ago and some trophies I earned are still listed on my profile. Has the game disappeared for anybody else? Does this have to do with PlayStation ending PS3 support? I apologize if this is not the place to ask this question, but I’m unable to contact PS support in my own country at the moment because they are “too busy”...",
    "Easter night. 98 years old. I got to hold her hand, touch her hair, and kiss her forehead. I got to say goodbye hours before she passed. I took pictures of her photos hanging on her walls, I took in the smell of her bedroom, I walked around her kitchen with family one last time. It was such a beautiful day, perfect weather, the sun was shining, birds were chirping. My aunt said to me \"when I hear the birds sing, I'll always remember mom.\" It broke my heart. I love my grandma. I love my family. Every family has its problems, I learned so much just from sitting and listening to my aunts and uncle talk that those problems just didn't matter. We are family. They had so much wisdom and love to give to me. They knew I wasn't very close with her, but they let me sit as long as I needed with her. I'm so happy I didn't wait any longer to see her. My brothers didn't get to say goodbye, only me. I feel lucky to have looked into those blue eyes one last time. I know she loved me and I love her. Rest easy Nan, tell Papa and Nick we love and miss them dearly.",
    "My son just turned 5 a couple of weeks ago. We always give kisses and hugs but I told him for awhile now that I don't want him to kiss me on the lips. I use the term inappropriate because it's the best way I know how to put it for him to understand. He sees me kiss my husband tonight and he said that I shouldn't kiss daddy on the lips. I explained that because mommy and daddy are husband and wife that it's okay. I told him that if he ever gets a wife, he can kiss her on the lips too. And he simply said \"or him\". I told him that is exactly right. He can love whoever he loves. I'm so proud that he even thought to say that because he has been around a few trans people but never a gay couple before. Love is love little dude. ❤",
    "Fast food has some kind of backroom deal with the pickle industry. Notice the hamburger pickle chips sold at the store are far thicker than the pickles on fast food burgers? They are also packed in a weaker brine, so the thick consumer chips require much higher brine content to maintain the pickle flavor. So while fast food gets paper thin, moist but not drenched, just as flavorful pickle slices: consumers are left with thick, sloppy pickle chips. It affects the profile of the burger. How many times has pickle juice washed your toppings off your burger, left your burger too high profile to add the other toppings you wanted, made such a mess with all the juice that anything else on your plate was ruined, or just made it impossible to hold your burger together with a couple of 1/3\" thick sponges slipping around on top drenching everything anytime you tried to grip it? If consumers had access to fast food pickles, they wouldn't rely on the fast food industry for low profile, topping worthy, manageable burgers. How entrenched is this conspiracy? Go to your local deli, buy one of those boars head pickles they have sitting in a jar on the counter, ask the guy to slice it thin with the deli meat slicer. They won't do it. Or go to Sam's Club and try to find fast food style pickles. You won't. All they offer is the thick consumer quality ones you can get at the grocery store. Even though their target customer is small business owners, they know regular consumers shop there too, and they won't risk any of us having access to fast food thin sliced pickles.",
    "The depersonalisation/derealization is increasing. Ive been mentally ill since i was 13, im now 23. The worst its ever been was in 2016/2017, and now its coming back severely. In 2017 i was diagnosed bipolar type 2, but my psychiatrists evaluation was short and he suspected schizophrenic psychosis as well. In other words schizoaffective disorder. I have a lot of trauma and cptsd symptoms. Ive painted since i was 5, and i cant describe with words all of the fantasy and creativity i have stuck inside my head. My paintings went from realism mixed with surrealism and now an increase in surrealism because of my dreams. I dont relate to most in my age and it makes me lonely and isolated. Most people dont percieve the world like i do even though i know there are some out there. But i cant find them. As im writing this im experiencing deja vu. I remember writing this before. I can see into the future but no one would believe me if i told them even though i can even prove it sometimes. I feel like i might not make it past 30 and i feel like this world is more of an illusion than we like to admit, but it doesnt matter. Im just exhausted and i dont know what to do.

    "So I’m terribly , horridly , confused about my sexuality . I’m a very very curious person by nature . I’m curious about everything . I’m a 17 year old girl in a homophobic family if that’s relevant . However , my friends and schools have always been very friendly and I’ve never been told that gay people were wrong by them . Lots of my friends have been bi , and it’s made me curious . I’ve fantasized about girls when I was 14, and these fantasies were sexual in nature. I had “crushes” on girls though idk if I should call them that . It was more being shocked at their beauty , and kinda fantasizing about them . Although if I ever had to date a girl I’d pass . Kissing a girl seems interesting but not desirable . I’d do it out of curiosity idk if I’d legitimately like them . When I was around that age , I’d wanted to be gay . Like I know how weird that sounds but I’ve had pretty bad experiences with boys . Lots of very poor male role models in my life , and my mom is pretty anti guys and tells me how awful all men are , when I was growing up . Some lesbians try to make themselves like men and even marry one right ? Could the same thing happen in reverse ? Fake attraction fueled by desperation. As of now , I find women beautiful the way flowers are , its aesthetic . My “crush” was extremely beautiful but I wouldn’t do anything with her not really . I’m so confused .",
    "\"We knew that fans were hungry for more Survivor--and so were we. We looked at this group of players and thought, 'these guys came ready to play.' And as always, we have to stay a step ahead of them. So we decided, let's put the game on fast-forward. 'You think you can take your time figuring out your strategy and looking for idols? Think again. Everybody else is talking and somebody already found the idol. And if you blink, you're voted out.' I think it's the natural evolution of the game. The last few seasons, every single vote is complex. Every single Tribal Council, the gameplay is aggressive and has consequences. So this is almost a response to that. 'You wanna play hard from the beginning? Got it. We'll make it harder.'\"",
    "I just got a request to help out the child of a person I haven't talked in 18 years. This old and close friend's wife disliked me so I was already on limited contact. But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

    "so Im 21.  My friends are all my age or younger and we are in our 3rd year of college.  They LOVE to drink.  I have since fallen back from drinking, and that has made me realize that I have little to nothing in common with them.  I like my friends a lot, but recently I noticed they tend to ignore my invites to do things that dont involve going to booze late at night.  Even normal, fun things that most people would like to do they arent interested in and will ignore my offer.  I get liking to drink, but holy fuck it seems like its their whole life purpose to get drunk.  This is a very hard time to meet new people as well, so I kinda just feel lost.  When i talk to them sober/when were not drinking and partying our conversations suuuuuuuuck.  Its like I just met them but these are people ive known for 2+ years.  I got a job on the weekends, and so far Ive had more fun at work with my coworkers than I have with my friends.  It sucks.  Its so stupid that society expects college kids to all be wild, unhinged, borderline alcoholics.

There is no battle phase on my turn one, so after performing actions, I'd ask if he has a response and he'd say no. Ok, my board is set and I end on Bow Wow and one Prank Kid. He allows me to set backrow. I declare End Phase and he says he Nibs me at the end of my Main Phase. Can he do that, I gave him several chances within the main phase even after I completed my combo?

    "So, I just wanted to make a little post about the condition of atheists and how it's like being one in this country. First of all, it's quite disheartening to see that literally most of your country's population loathes you for your opinions and lack of belief in religion. In most social media groups of our country atheists are seen as outcasts. Most of us here are closeted atheists since there's a pretty massive chance that our families won't take this matter well. Moreover, there have been a number of brutal murders of atheists whose \"fault\" was expressing their opinions, which lead to their demise. In my opinion, freedom of speech doesn't exist here and it's despairing being in a country where you can be murdered for your opinions.",

Então tipo, eu falei pra ela, que eu tinha me comportado a semana passada e eu queria comer chocolate né, e que tipo, por mais que eu faça as coisas direito, a gente tem a necessidade de comer um doce de vez em quando. Aí ela ficou puta, começou falar que eu preferia os doces do que os amigos, e na real, pra mim os dois caminham lado a lado na vida. Se eu não como doce eu fico estressado e se eu não tenho amigos, eu me sinto sozinho, o que me deixa triste e me leva a comer doce pra maquiar a tristeza.

    "GB is what go me into my love for hot sauce. I have bought a lot of it over the years. Recently I've noticed some small changes. The red sauce no longer has Japanese chilli peppers in the ingredients. The green sauce no longer has Mojo. Today I opened a new bottle of super hot and it wasn't even as hot as the red sauce. I shook the hell out of it and tried some more. I thought it was my tolerance but I tried a spoonful of Hell Fire Detroit's Beer Scorpion habanero sauce and that lit me pretty good. Perhaps that batch or bottle just lacks heat? I know GB isn't doing a private reserve anymore. Maybe the ingredient changes were to save money. I'd honestly pay more for it if it meant keeping the OG recipes. Maybe Dexter is getting tired of running the company? Maybe he is going to sell it?

    "I regularly lose all kinds of attraction for everyone,meaning no sexual or romantic attraction to anyone,meaning no desire to date anyone and looking at content and people that usually would make me feel feel sexually attracted stops doing just that.Those phases usually last between 2 or 4 months and I'm always worried that that my attraction will never come back when I have those phrases,however up until now it always has.Im pretty sure it's not sexual dysfunction becuase that doesnt include loss of romantic attraction and it doesn't affect me in any physical way,its all psychological.Im also sure that I'm not asexual since I do feel all that attraction outside of those phases.I have tried researching my symptoms but I've never really found anything that would match,and it's just really worrying me and I dont even know if its abnormal or  just a normal part of puberty.I also marked it NSFW just to be sure.",
    "So I’ve noticed that viewer ship is all over the place depending on when I post or what I post. I just recently had posts get around 5000-54000 views. I posted again earlier in the morning and only got about 14 views. I’m wondering if when I posts effects my views as much as even the content I’m posting. I’ve also noticed people don’t really want to know about my life they would rather watch me do impulsive things that they more or less want to do but can’t go through with like dying my hair or making things that the audiences hobbies coincide with. The steps of getting viewer ship seems very difficult but also all over the place. Some people use hashtags some don’t but still get 1000’s of views. What constitutes as the perfect time, the perfect description with hashtags or even the best content for your demographic? I’ve definitely improved my viewership since the vine era but it’s all really an equation of when and what. At some point I’m really hoping to find what it is my followers or new viewers exactly want to see but until then I am still figuring it out. Has anyone noticed what seems the best time to post or even the best hashtags to use? What content seems to do better for newer users to help boost their platforms? Maybe some people could take a look at my platform and critique what I post so I can improve. tiktok: ",
    "I was talking with my therapist today about all of the judgements my JNMIL has about me.  We talked about how a lot of these judgements are at odds with one another and don’t make sense.   For example, following my DD’s birth she complained that I contribute nothing to my marriage or our finances, despite the fact that DH and I both work successful high paying jobs where I frequently earn more than him.   Then when i returned to work, she accused me of not caring about my DD’s wellbeing and being an awful mom. Despite knowing that these ideas literally don’t make sense when taken together, I still can’t help but let her get in my head.  My therapist asked why I thought that was and truly I can’t answer.  I’m curious, why do your MILs words/judgements bring you down?",
    "Reading a translation of Anabasis, I noticed that having escaped the Army of Artaxerxes, and made it through the Armenian mountain passes, the Ten Thousand encounter a reoccurring trope amongst the various Pontic peoples they encounter. There are multiple instances where the local villages flee their homes in the face of the oncoming army, and hole up in Strongholds/Citadels. From the book, it is my understanding that these are not populated settlements and are only occupied to wait out hostile forces. It also seems that they were built collectively between multiple villages rather than each village having its own small strong-point. What other sources, if any, reference this practice? Is there any evidence for these small strongholds? In the book, they are often taken by the greeks without a prolonged siege or any equipment so how sophisticated could they have been?",

    "After reading some of the reviews that trash this film I had to speak up.<br/><br/>This film is gritty and dirty. There is content which is not pleasant, swearing and violence amounts other things. What else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? Well more than that actually, it about choices and what you Choose! Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did. At no point did it ever say \"Look at this, its cool.\" For those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in Britain, not just Scotland. I being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.<br/><br/>That being said, those things do not take anything away from the film, the quality of plot and story, or the acting which is Stunning! Robert Carlise as Begbe was excellent, and Ewan MacGregor shined. Also the character Spud was worth a mention he really was quite good.<br/><br/>This film is in my Opinion a work of Genius, that represents the book accurately.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.",
    "Why the poor box office performance?  Why the bad reviews?  Why the bad word of mouth?  I really didn't see anything horrible about this movie!  First of all, it's a character-driven story.  There's little subplots involving jealousy and philandering, but it's not handled in a soapy fashion.  I didn't feel any of the characters were one-dimensional.<br/><br/>\nOf course, Mike Myers steals the show as the homosexual club owner Steve Rubell.  I don't know the real Steve Rubell, so you be the judge whether or not his performance was accurate, but I have to say that Myers did an incredible job!  And I'm not overstating the least bit!  You watch him in this movie and you totally forget that this is the same guy who played Austin Powers.  Not to say I didn't realize Myers had talent prior to watching this film.  He has definitely proven that he has talent as a comic actor, but I didn't know he had the chops to pull off a straight, dramatic role.  Even his accent sounds real, not the least bit phony.  I'm surprised Myers didn't even get an Oscar nod.  He should've at least gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Trust me--you will be blown away by his performance in this movie!<br/><br/>The music is great.  It's always great to reminisce to the great songs from the seventies.  Mark  Christopher nicely captured the whole rebellious atmosphere of 54.  We're given a taste of the drug addiction and even the sexual promiscuity that made the place famous--there's a scene where a couple shamelessly pounds away on the balcony.  I read one person's review, saying that this movie should've been an hour longer.  I find it ironic that people watch movies that are two and a half to three hours long and complain, \"Oh, this movie dragged!  Oh, this movie needed more editing!\" Yet they watch a succintly timed film like this and complain it's too short. This may not have been the most thorough examination of the famous nightclub, but I think it got to the point.  No reason why we have to go into every tiny detail.<br/><br/>This is a serious, dramatic film but it's also very entertaining.  I actually had a smile on my face when the movie ended.  It ended on a happy note without having that forced, schmaltzy Hollywood feel.  Plus, I really like that song \"Knock on Wood\" that they played over the credits.<br/><br/>\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",
    "The Silence of the Lambs is a timeless classic, whose more than adequate storytelling never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most entertaining but least fun films to watch all because of its disturbingly genius atmosphere.\nIt's masterfully acted, especially from Hopkins's side turning this film into a clever and unforgettable masterpiece. Even though Hopkins and Foster don't have much screentime together they still put on a show to remember. Aside from top of the line acting and the directing the script from Ted Tally's (based on the novel by Thomas Harris) is career-defining. From thriller to psychological horror, this movie handles the tone and atmosphere perfectly while switching between the two. In terms of being a psychological horror movie, it does it perfecting as it wraps itself around the viewers' head and proves that gore and blood aren't needed to scare an audience. Surprisingly (and deservedly) this film swooped all five major Oscar categories (Best actor, actress, director, screenplay and picture) even though it was released in February, a whole year before the academy awards.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable feat in film making and you be seen by everyone, a film lover or not. Shocking and suspenseful it is a thrill to behold.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10",
    "The best film in the era of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Supremely well acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize.

Realmete with this film you can compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly.",
    "I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.<br/><br/>\nIt is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. <br/><br/>As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see \"Hart's War\" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).<br/><br/>All in all, \"The Great Escape\" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",
    "Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel \"Hearts of darkness\" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.<br/><br/>The film has a simple premise, US Army Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into Cambodia through a river, to assassinate a renegade, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. It's an accessible premise, allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers, and yet this film is anything but shallow. It's a journey into madness and hysteria, an observation into the darkness of humanity. I could write a book analyzing this film, there's just so much to talk about. My interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find Kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character's inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie, dehumanization. The journey through the river is also reminiscent of Dante's perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. There are three major stops before Kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought, as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.<br/><br/>The first stop is with lieutenant Kilgore. That stop shows that Kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. Their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can't comprehend the consequences the war will bring. In one scene of the movie, the \"heroic\" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies, Captain Kilgore uses Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures Valkyries, he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. At this stage, although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy, they still understand the innocent.<br/><br/>The second stop is the USO show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. At this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself, becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. The soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. Now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.\nThe last stop before Kurtz is the Do-long Bridge and it's at this point that a soldier has gone too far, he's experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can't return to a normal state of mind.<br/><br/>The final stop on the journey is Kurtz, at this point only Willard and Kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness, the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. Kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. Bypassing the madness stage he's able to see the world for what it truly is, filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. Willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. He kills Kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. In the end Willard has a choice, succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken Kurtz's place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon, he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving Lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe, he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. Both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn't, they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.<br/><br/>The film presents this study of the human psyche through Carmine Coppola's eerie score, hypnotic images, and some haunting scenes, essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. It's here where Coppola succeeds the most. His ability to create a living \"hell\" is so amazing, and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. It provides a commentary on war and religion, making the subtext even vaster. The film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film's runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat, and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner, conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer's breath away. Coppola's direction transcends itself, the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows, most notable during Col. Kurtz's first appearance. The troubled production obviously didn't hurt the film at all, and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. Apocalypse Now is beautifully haunting, utterly hellish, terrifyingly intelligent, and magnificently wrought, it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war, but also its meaningfulness and beauty. Not only is this one of the best films ever made, it's a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. It is Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. Rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon, immortal for its contribution to cinema, and a truly unforgettable experience, Apocalypse Now is cinema at its most complete, crystalline and pure.",
    "After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions, ridiculous CG-assisted stunts and mindless action, I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better. <br/><br/>The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle. <br/><br/>De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots, but all are carefully tied into the through-line of the story to match the main character's progression. <br/><br/>The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story, The Bay of Pigs debacle, and traces the steps that lead to it, one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character, Edward Wilson, barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did (the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wire-rimmed or horn-rimmed glasses), but it didn't ruin the film for me. <br/><br/>Overall though, definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand, rather than forget.",
    "Well I guess it's official, I'm eating my words as we speak. Yeah, I'm the guy who doesn't like sequels and yet here I am giving positive ratings to Star Trek Into Darkness and now The Hangover Part III. It's scary to think of what I might do next. If the new Fast and the Furious movie impresses me, I guess I'll just skip reviewing it and go straight into denial. But seriously folks, I went into the new Hangover with really low expectations. We're talking bottom feeder if you know what I mean. So from now on I think that's the key. I'm going to take this approach with every film I see. That way I'll stroll out of the theater as a movie critic that raves about everything and comes off as not so darn grumpy. Whoa, forget what I just said. I was merely kidding people!<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what occurs in part III. At the very beginning, we find mentally unstable \"wolfpack\" member Alan (Zach Galifianakis getting the most exposure he's had in any of the Hangover films) buying a giraffe, putting it in the back of his truck, and killing it on the freeway (I'm thinking you know how it happened). Upon doing this, he irritates his family and draws concern from the other \"wolfpack\" members (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha). Everyone but Alan, stages an intervention on his behalf to get him to a treatment center somewhere in Arizona. He'll agree to go if his three buds will drive him there. As the four of them set out on a moderately short road trip, their car is rammed off the road, they are dragged out of it (held at gunpoint mind you), and one of the crew (Bartha of course) is taken hostage. This sets off a chain of events which leads everybody to venture back to good old Sin City.<br/><br/>Well let's get down to it. Right off the bat I want to let you know why I liked The Hangover Part III. I enjoyed it for the exact reason that some critics panned it. This flick doesn't try to be like the other two in the trilogy. In fact, it feels like a totally different animal all together. Yes there is a dash of the funny (something part I did effortlessly and part II attempted miserably), but there's also a hint of darkness that comes close to turning everything into a sort of black comedy with shards of mild violence. For me, this is an effective way to wrap things up (unless there is a part IV of course). You can tell that the director (Todd Phillips) wanted to avoid copping out and injected part III with a little more juice (this is the other reason I liked it and most critics didn't. They think Phillips went way over the top or felt he had to prove something). He did the film justice by avoiding the same tired plot line (everyone gets smashed and wakes up not knowing what the heck just happened) while making an effort to tie together loose ends from the other two movies (by way of flashbacks). This is done to effect in the first 15 minutes and it sets everything in motion.<br/><br/>The actors then promptly assume their personalities from the first two installments. Doug Billings who's never around for the debauchery, plays the happily married nice guy. Alan, plays the screw loose, borderline mental patient who nonchalantly goes about his business. Phil, is the smug, unhappily married school teacher who is calm under pressure, and Stu is the manic anxiety ridden dentist who thinks all hope is gone. Together they fit their roles like comfortable old shoes. Overall their performances are manically unhinged. You get what's required of them coupled with a fresher more potently nasty script this time around (part II's had lazy written all over it).<br/><br/>As far as supporting work goes, I thought John Goodman (gangster Marshall) was a nice little addition to the Hangover family (he riffs off his Big Lebowski character but just not quite as intense). I also like the addition of a love interest for Alan (someone besides man crush Phil) in Melissa McCarthy. She seems to make a cameo in everything these days and certainly is a hoot as a pawn shop owner who candidly berates her wheelchair confined mother.<br/><br/>The only setback for this Hangover is the blatant deviation from the focus of the four stars of the movie (the infamous \"wolfpack\"). This exercise is bent on giving two supporting characters their own vehicle (Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Galifianakis). True these guys are funny and steal many a scene, but the other members of the cast don't get a lot of room to breathe. They get kind of pushed to the side and become sort of frowned upon (Bradley Cooper recently got nominated for an Oscar, give him some props for gosh sakes). And what's with always having Justin Bartha's character not present with the other members of the \"pack\" when the madness of their misadventures is going down. It seems predetermined and silly. What, is he not good enough an actor to occupy some precious screen time with his buddies (Bartha was in the colossal flop Gigli (2003) so maybe that's it, who knows).<br/><br/>When it all comes down to it, I found myself at ease with the way part III whisked by. It's darker than the first one, funnier than the second one, and more daring than both of them. I laughed, I winced, and felt confident in recommending this hot mess of a movie. It's a sequel all right, but it tries really hard not to be one. I admire that. With nothing to lose, you should go check out The Hangover part III. It's a solid time killer and a required \"hair of the dog\" if you will.",
    "As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.<br/><br/>However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.<br/><br/>For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).<br/><br/>The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.<br/><br/>What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.",
    "I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as \"one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles\" and \"one of the classics of the 70's\". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a \"crazy house\" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.<br/><br/>What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.<br/><br/>-10/10",
    "I am an engineer working offshore in North Sea. I have seen the movie this evening in UK. Is really a good movie, congratulations to all involved you done a great job showing a little bit of ''life in offshore rig''. Looks like in this movie is BP fault but in real world at the rig site everyone has the right to STOP THE JOB if something is wrong or something is going on against the procedures. I have work before in BP rigs in North Sea and I stop the job when I wasn't happy with what is going on I had all the support from the Service Company that I am working for and also BP company understood my concerns. If you are a engineer, roughneck, derrick-man or whatever you are at Rig Site if you think that something is going wrong and against the procedures STOP THE JOB. I do it and I will do again better to lose my job than to see people dying.(Thanks for reading my review)",
    "Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.<br/><br/>Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.<br/><br/>Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.<br/><br/>I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.<br/><br/>I hope my talk helps.",
    "My name is Cecilia and being from Manila this film is very personal to me because my grandfather sacrificed his life during WWII. According to eyewitness accounts, he was tied to a post, doused with kerosene and set on fire. I am watching this film to somehow pay tribute to him and those who selflessly gave up their lives to ensure a free and humane future for all of us. I felt though that the film underestimated what we Filipinos really went through during the war. It would have been just to include the other atrocities perpetuated by the Japanese: babies thrown in the air and caught with bayonets, women brutally raped and breasts carved out, or the massacre of approximately 100,000 unarmed and innocent civilians during the battle for the liberation of Manila on the first days of February 1945. Nevertheless, I am grateful for director John Dahl for shedding light on a chapter in our history that many people hardly know about , specially the present generation, The Bataan Death March.",
    "After watching this movie I can say that no it is not as good as the original but that does mean that it is a bad movie. What I was really excited to see in this movie from the trailers was the scares and the demon nun Valak. The movie does not disappoint and can't wait to see the next entry in the conjuring series!",
    "`The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped, bound and gagged, into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most, if not all, of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet, Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving indifference, to be a criminal-type with a heart of gold, and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline, which exists merely as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed, well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright, sparkling sheen.   In fact, Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham, who makes for a very `cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",
    "Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!",
    "8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.<br/><br/>The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.<br/><br/>The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the \"Free World,\" are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.<br/><br/>Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.<br/><br/>All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.",
    "Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney.  That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist.  He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br/><br/>But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.  Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself.  Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!  Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.",
    "Dawn of the Dead<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.<br/><br/>And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>Grade: A-",
    "This film will generate anger because it throws a \"deadpan\" brick directly towards cultural dysfunction and mass delusion. \"War Machine,\" and Brad Pitt, even exceeded the deadpan message of \"Being There\" a film from a less cynical time in history but still relevant to this day. <br/><br/>\"War Machine\" does a great job illustrating how disconnected the every-man has become in relation to reality. We live in a time where facts are now selectively chosen to support forgone perspectives rather than being absolute, universal, and irrefutable. <br/><br/>We live in a time where personage, perceptions, and public relations matter more than overview, objectives, conclusions, and endpoints. Reality has been set adrift. <br/><br/>It was a brave thing to produce this film because it speaks to a very narrow audience. Most people won't be entertained by the communication mechanism (deadpan) nor will the understand the message. Few people will be open to perspectives other than those which are preconceived. Some people are not aware and thus cannot acknowledge the wounds and damage that political lies have done to the American process and psyche. <br/><br/>To conclude our failed state of affairs, the affairs of a failed nation state (our nation state) I am not with him because he is certainly not with me no matter how much he tells me otherwise. The cohesion of leadership, truth, and the American way has left the building.<br/><br/>It is more of a shame that people won't understand this film, or won't want to. And that is how far we have fallen. Perhaps Rome fell the same way on the sword and misadventure of its own lies and delusion.",
    "\"The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived, without wealth, without property, without official title or office.  Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies, nor the ruler of vast lands.  He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift.  Yet men, governments, dignitaries from all over the world, have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth, who led his country to freedom.\"<br/><br/>This quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film \"Gandhi\".  Richard Attenborough directed this massive epic about the man that freed India. The film opens with Gandhi's assassination.  The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi's funeral on January 31st, 1981, the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral.  It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation. This film was made before CGI (computer generated images), so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed.<br/><br/>\nMahatma Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art.  This film has made and will make millions of people aware of the little brown man that took on the British Empire and won.  \"Gandhi\" serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history.<br/><br/>\nBen Kingsley played Gandhi.  He was the perfect for the role.  He resembled the real Gandhi.  He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man. He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.   He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part. And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the \"big-time actor\" persona did not get in the way of viewing the film.  He did win both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor, for this role, which I agree he deserved.  He became Gandhi.<br/><br/>The cinematography was outstanding.  Attenborough filmed \"Gandhi\" on location in India.  The scenes of India are spectacular, and India is very much another character in the film.  This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi.  Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta.  It is suggested by Kingsley, on the DVD, that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming.  They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman.  Undeterred by their negative thinking, he persevered to enlist thousands of Indians to help make this film.  Every crowd scene, he used real Indians from the area. Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for everyone.  It should be required viewing in high schools, as part of History class.  The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant.  It is also a beautiful work of art.  This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood (see \"Pearl Harbor\" for that). Of course, it would have been hard to screw up a movie about such a great man. 10/10",
    "I walked into the movie theater expecting to see Adam Sandler make a complete buffoon of himself. However, when I came out I was impressed. There was a depth to this movie I did not see coming, and it took me completely off guard. \"Click\" proved to be a powerful, emotional, and humorous piece of work. There was a certain philosophical message in this movie, in which I think, we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work-aholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie, and in \"Click\" he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh. Definitely a 10/10 in my book.",
    "It's hard to say if is an improvement or not on the original, but it's certainly a good continuation of the story this time more focused on Alex's origin and life.

    "There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.<br/><br/>The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.<br/><br/>You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless. <br/><br/>The King's Speech boasts an exceptional cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.<br/><br/>The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year.",
    "I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.<br/><br/>10/10 Highly Recommended",
    "I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.<br/><br/>'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx (all good actresses) could respectively bring out the sweetness, vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy, humour, liveliness, enthusiasm and devotion (towards family) of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.<br/><br/>In addition, the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laugh-out-loud Bonnie Hunt, a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston, a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki (one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves)'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating oh-look-I'm-so-cute child models.<br/><br/>The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio, switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side, the wild and smooth cinematography, slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.<br/><br/>The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well, actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story.",
    "This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",
    "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. <br/><br/>This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. <br/><br/>The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. <br/><br/>The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. <br/><br/>I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.",
    "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.<br/><br/>But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.<br/><br/>I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date.",
    "When I see films like this, it really underlines the programmed ignorance of most Americans, and just how effective the government and the media are at shaping a false narrative. Al Qaeda was never an existential threat to America, and the Taliban was an internecine problem only to local Afghans and different Islamic sects. The conflict and motivation set up in this film is just ludicrous and phony. I am retired US Army, I still have contacts in the service who know the truth about Afghanistan. This film is a sham.",
    "Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for \"Airplane\", \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\", and the \"Naked Gun\" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody! <br/><br/>I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the \"Hotel Gay Schluffen\", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.<br/><br/>I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him afterwards!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If \"Top Secret!\" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means \"She whose bosoms defy gravity\"?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)<br/><br/>The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.<br/><br/>It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, but there's no doubt about it, \"Top Secret!\" IS one of the great comedies of our time.",
    "Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. \"When you re-write a script it gets better and better\" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like \"Nick of Time\" \"The Astronaut's Wife\" and \"Secret Window\" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a \"safe\", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!",
    "Heartbreaking yet captivating, Changeling's story was fascinating all the way through, even if the first half was a little slow. It certainly was a compelling story, shot beautifully, and written well. Angelina Jolie gave a mesmerizing performance as grief stricken Christine Collins, as well as the many young actors in the film. It's certainly worth the time.",
    "In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends because he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it was free, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.",
    "For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the characters in the movie. Sorry for those who's lives were so well protected that they've never been exposed to the likes of us but, that's how we talk and act. It's a type-A environment and we use it to protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.<br/><br/>I am well versed on the facts as provided by the MSM however, as someone in the biz I also know that the fly in the ointment are the facts.<br/><br/>1. The firing of mortars is an art and the mortar launcher has to be anchored to the ground or every mortar will land off target. The mortars landing on the CIA compound are dead accurate and also require spotters to assist with any corrections.<br/><br/>2. Aviano AB, Italy is about 2-hours away. Had they been launched, even if only to do a low fly-by, would have driven off the attackers; just like I used them in Iraq in Mosul, Tikrit, and Baghdad. I don't know why the Commander of the 555 (Triple Nickel) didn't launch. It's one of the big questions that remain unanswered by the media or the movie.<br/><br/>3. Hillary's statement that, \"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?\" was a red herring. Because it was neither. As later testimony bore out, it was a planned, coordinated, terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11.<br/><br/>4. All UAS aircraft are armed.

    "In the midst of the many wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick, it is strange to note how rarely people mention \"Barry Lyndon\".<br/><br/>The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.<br/><br/>Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in \"Barry Lyndon\" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.<br/><br/>The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.<br/><br/>\"Barry Lyndon is\", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them! KimotoCat",
    "It is too unbelievable and too lame. It is unfunny and like a cartoon that is on film.\nExaggeration is OK when it is interesting not when it is a spoof that takes itself seriously.",
    "When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.<br/><br/>Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots. <br/><br/>I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish \"whodunit\" as well. <br/><br/>Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as \"Del Spooner\", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in \"Enemy of the State\" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, \"Independence Day\" and \"Men in Black\". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.<br/><br/>A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. <br/><br/>The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a \"good guy\" or not. <br/><br/>This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.<br/><br/>Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the \"camera moving with moving object\" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment. <br/><br/>In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. <br/><br/>Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that \"I, Robot\" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.<br/><br/>Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie, any movie that gives you fun, drama, action, mystery, and makes you think is a great movie. Thank goodness I, Robot is all of the above.",
    "Being German I'm not really into the Hooligan way of life. I'm just fond of the Brit way of making films and this one is just brilliant. Of course you can argue about whether the director Nick Love is showing the life of some football thugs too positive and without the \"never do this, kids\" attitude, but...this is just a great piece of film. It has terrific acting (especially Frank Harper does a great job), splendid camera and editing and a more than suiting soundtrack. Watched it with some pals and it was just great fun. The scene where Rod tells his girlfriend's parents about his inner thoughts is a highlight. So if you're able to shut out all thoughts of moral and you're just interested in 90 minutes of quality film-making of today...watch this. It's definitely all worth it!",
    "A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Helen Mirren works a miracle with her characterization. When the Queen is forced by circumstances to address her people and mourn in public Diana's death, Helen Mirren doesn't forget that her character is a seasoned public speaker but not an actress. When she delivers her speech to her subjects, the real strength is in her commitment to her duty and not the meaning of her words. It is a chilling, masterful acting stroke. Stephen Frears uses the brilliantly structured script to reveal something that's always being in front of our eyes but we've never seen. The privacy of the most public people in the world. Michael Sheen is terrific as Blair and every piece of casting is truly inspired but it's Helen Mirren's film, oh yeah, one hundred per cent.",
    "Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.<br/><br/>The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous \"blondes\"), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.<br/><br/>\"To reveal more,\" as Leonard Maltin wrote, \"would be unthinkable.\"<br/><br/>While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!<br/><br/>One of the all-time greats. They definitely don't make them like this anymore.",
    "What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!<br/><br/>BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.<br/><br/>Go see this movie!",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "This of course is not a great movie but I just have to give it a 10/10. I have never laughed more in my life. Even the jokes that aren't funny are funny. This film's comedic build up is about the best you will ever see. It doesn't even matter what the punch line is, its how they get to it thats hilarious.<br/><br/>Now this cast was perfect. Anytime you have Randy Quaid in a film you just know the film is going to make you life just by looking at him. Kingpin couldn't have shown this any better as he plays an Amish man who just happens to be amazingly talented at bowling. Woody Harrelson plays a has-been ex-professional bowler who makes a comeback with managing through Randy Quaid. Together they go on a ride across the country making money left and right. Along the journey they are great supporting comedic performances given by Bill Murray and Vanessa Angel who certainly makes the look of the film more appealing.<br/><br/>The Farrelly brothers in my opinion give their best direction they've yet to have. Yet it is the writers who so perfectly set up one joke after another. It seems as if the script is so sharp that their are jokes within jokes. The Farrelly brother handle this material so well by virtual unknowns.<br/><br/>As I have said before this is not a great film but I would highly recommend this if your in the mood of watching something spontaneous. It may not be the most technically sound movie ever made or the deepest but I have never laughed so much in life and that in it self is what comedies are about.",
    "Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with Bill Murray losing his job, girlfriend, and apartment, all in the same day. He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups, exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, \"I think your ready for the Special Olympics!\" Harold also shines in a bit-part in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand, \"You speak some English?\" The student answers back \"SOB and $hit\" and the whole class than repeats it.<br/><br/>The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy joins the fun as likable, lovable \"Ox.\" There are the typical sex gags, simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.<br/><br/>After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine, having silly one-lines like, \"Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do.\" rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe, the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.",
    "I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\".",
    "Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****<br/><br/>What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.<br/><br/>In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. <br/><br/>Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. <br/><br/>Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. <br/><br/>We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. <br/><br/>These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. <br/><br/>Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. <br/><br/>Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>4/4",
    "Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.<br/><br/>Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.<br/><br/>Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.<br/><br/>The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!<br/><br/>This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.<br/><br/>PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive.",
    "The Auteurist Perspective - The most unorthodox way of viewing this picture is as a kind of formalist exercise. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has talked about his desire to make a film tailored exactly to the format of a Hollywood action movie, even going so far as to count the number of cuts and camera set-ups in the blockbusters he watched for research. Everything in the movie may be taking place within quotation marks, as in the melodramas of Douglas Sirk or, more obliquely, Gus van Sant's 'Psycho'. The film wants to be both an archetypal big sci-fi action movie whilst simultaneously a pastiche of the form. The gorgeously overblown shot of Ripley and Call standing amid the clouds at the film's close certainly suggests a playful tweaking of blockbuster bombast. However, the 'Alien' series may not be the most appropriate place for this experiment; the series is far more defined by spaces and silences than by frenetic action of the Bruckheimer variety. Even James Cameron's 'Aliens' is surprisingly slow in its build-up; by contrast, Resurrection's relentless pace becomes oddly monotonous and the film loses the distinctive texture Jeunet brings to it.<br/><br/>The Whedonite Perspective - The problems with the script are mostly additions or changes to Joss Whedon's original (which is available online). Whedon rightly made Ripley's resurrection the backbone for the story, finding new things to do with a character many believed had reached the end of her life, both literally and creatively. He also carefully fleshed out the supporting characters just enough to keep them interesting. There are small problems even in his original script - Purviss is sidelined when his predicament demands imaginative exploration, and the narrative is more linear than you'd expect from this writer. But it's the feeble alterations that damage the film - reducing characters like Hillard (in particular) to cyphers, changing the ending so the audience never gets to see earth (the only place, as Whedon instinctively understood, that the climax could possibly take place), and removing a lot of the texture of the setting, like the marijuana fields. 'I'm a stranger here myself' should have been one of the great closing lines in movie history, up there with 'Tomorrow is another day' and 'Shut up and deal', but the dialogue (Whedon's great strength) is mangled by a director working in his second language, and who seems to be paying more attention to the lighting anyway.<br/><br/>The Cynical Perspective - The 'Alien' series is, by this point, a cash cow that everyone involved wants to milk until it bleeds. 'Alien3' ended Ripley's story with an unflinching finality that 'Resurrection' can only cheapen, no matter how good it is. The hiring of a cult french director is a sop to the critics who lionise Scott and Fincher's contributions - and whilst prior instalments were filmed in England, this production was mounted in LA, for the convenience of everyone involved. It wouldn't do to make too much of an effort on what is, after all, the latest sausage on the string. The suits' only concern is the opening weekend; hence Winona, shoehorned in just in case Sigourney's box office draw is waning.<br/><br/>The Aesthetic Perspective - John Frizzell's score is the fourth classic in a row for the series; both lushly romantic and queasily menacing, it gives the film its own distinctive flavour. The production design is bold and distinctive, with perhaps a hint of playful parody (the sickly green light, the mad scientist outfits, the giant glass jars in the lab); the film looks like a comic strip version of its predecessors. Some of the direction is highly effective - the underwater sequence is devastatingly beautiful. The problem is the slightly over-ripe grotesquerie Jeunet brings out in the material, particularly in the way the cast is shot (Dominique Pinon looks like a malevolent garden gnome, Dan Hedaya resembles a sweaty gendarme). It sits uneasily with the straightforward disaster movie plot. The biggest miscalculation on the production front, however, is the Newborn. The thinking behind it - to give it an expressive face and thus complicate Ripley's (and our) emotional response to it - is sound enough, but it doesn't really come off in the finished creature, which looks like moldy old tissues clinging to a pipe-cleaner frame. Whedon's original conception of a white, red-veined alien of the traditional design might have worked more effectively, although even that might not have survived the aesthetic indignity of its impossible demise, getting sucked into space as a string of alien linguine.",
    "I've been slowly making my way through Guillermo del Toro's catalogue of movies and this is my first time watching Hell Boy. If you're a Del Toro fan, then this one won't disappoint. He's such a superior director - he adds artistry to this action film through his use of shot making, pacing and colour. At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself.",
    "George : Hey guys, remember that movie we all did a few years back called Ocean's Eleven?<br/><br/>Brad : Course we do, we had such a great time.<br/><br/>Julia : And let's not forget we made stacks of money on it. It was a hit!<br/><br/>George : Well here's an idea.Let's make a sequel!<br/><br/>Matt : Fantastic idea! I mean the first one had all of us in it but most of all it was directed, had cool music, had lots of us in it and had a great script.<br/><br/>Brad : The script? Oh yeah, the script, whatever.<br/><br/>Julia : Let's do it. Everyone will love seeing us mugging it up on the screen. Steven Soderbergh's a friend of mine so he'll love directing us again.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, he'll do it. He won't have to work too hard though because it's got us in it. In fact he can just stuff around and experiment with all sorts of stupid camera angles.<br/><br/>Matt : Won't that just confuse the audience and make them dizzy?<br/><br/>George : Stuff that! Just so long as everyone can make out it's us up there on the screen they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : And the music??<br/><br/>Brad : Pfft! Music? No one goes to the movies for music. They want to see stars. Like us! Let's just have any old stupid music for this one.<br/><br/>Matt : That's fine. What about the script?<br/><br/>Brad : What is it with you and the script? Hey here's an idea. Julia, you're so famous and wonderful<br/><br/>Julia : So are you Brad.<br/><br/>Brad : Thanks Julia. What I was saying was how about we have an entire sequence where your character pretends to be you! Everyone knows you're fantastic so they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great idea Brad. How do we fit that into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Julia! Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK. How about we get someone else as famous and wonderful as us to join in the cast? The audience will love that.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, let's get Bruce Willis in a pointless uncredited cameo. He's never been too fussy about what movies he's made before. He's bound to say yes.<br/><br/>Matt : How do we fit him into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Bruce Willis. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK, who else?<br/><br/>Brad : I'm way ahead of you here, Julia. I've got a famous wife so let's get someone who is famous and wonderful, with a famous husband and who they audience will love if they see her and I having a romantic scene.<br/><br/>All : Catherine Zeta Jones!<br/><br/>George : I'll call her and see. <br/><br/>(Ring Ring)<br/><br/>Catherine : Hello. George : Hi Catherine, George Clooney here. You might remember working with me in Intolerable Crueltythe audience loved it!<br/><br/>Catherine : Hi George. What's up?<br/><br/>George : We're making a sequel to Ocean's Eleven. It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt in it. How'd you like to be in it too?<br/><br/>Catherine : Yeah sure. What's it about?<br/><br/>George : Who cares?? It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt and you in it!!<br/><br/>Catherine : OK. But how about we film it in Europe? The audience will love that!<br/><br/>George : It's a deal. See ya.<br/><br/>Catherine : Bye<br/><br/>Julia : So how'd it go?<br/><br/>George : She's in AND she had a great idea. She reckons we could film it somewhere in Europe.<br/><br/>Brad : Fantastic!<br/><br/>Matt : So how does that fit into the script?<br/><br/>Julia : Who cares about the script!! It's got us in it! And anyone who liked Ocean's Eleven will get sucked into seeing it and by then it's too late for them to worry about the script because they've already paid their money.<br/><br/>George : And besides they'll love it because it's got me and Julia and Matt and Brad AND Catherine in it AND it will be filmed in Europe. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great. Let's do it!!<br/><br/>you get the idea.",
    "I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original – just: Wow!<br/><br/>It's clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the 'office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) – this movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for film geeks like me.

    "So once again, after the debacle of Prometheus, Ridley Scott has proved himself simultaneously a master of visuals and yet utterly incompetent when it comes to creating a believable Alien story.<br/><br/>The single biggest problem I had with Prometheus was the collection of imbeciles and weirdos that made up the crew, and one might have hoped that Mr Scott would have realised that himself and made amends this time round. Errr.... no, sadly not. Once again we're treated to a crew of simpletons who make THE MOST pathetic and unbelievable decisions possible. Are we really supposed to believe that a crew would just ditch it's primary mission (that we're told had been over 10 years in the planning to ensure their destination was safe, etc) just because they happened to stumble on a new planet purely by chance? Just plain ludicrous. And that's just the start. A few more examples :<br/><br/><ul><li>Assuming we suspend our disbelief and accept the whole \"let's risk all the colonists and everything we have planned for decades for to land on this new unknown planet instead\" premise, why do these alleged scientists once again TOTALLY disregard the need for any protective clothing? So no breathing equipment, nothing at all to protect them from any alien pathogens. Good thinking!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Faced with a choice of sending either an android, or pretty much the entire human crew with no protective gear, to investigate an alien world, who should go? Yeah that's right, send all the unprotected humans!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Choice of landing right near the source of the unknown signal, or land several miles away and in a foot of water despite there being solid and flat ground a few feet away? Yep, it's wet feet and a huge hike all round folks!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Little alien pods on this alien world puffing their alien spores into the air? Sure, just get your nose in there and have a good sniff. I'm sure it'll be fine!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crewmen get infected by said spores? Don't worry about any quarantine procedures, just carry them back to the ship while getting covered in their vomited-up blood.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alien organism just burst out of said infected crewman? Just open up the locked door and try to shoot it, but be careful you don't miss at point blank range and then slip up on the blood.... twice. (When that happened, people actually laughed in the cinema. I was half expecting a comedy sound effect the second time!)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tens of thousands of dead bodies, and an enormous dead city solely inhabited by David the android from the Prometheus mission, that the planetary scan managed to NOT pick up from orbit when determining the planet to be \"safe\"? No need to ask David what happened, just accept that it's all fine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dark basements to go into all on your own? Do it! Nothing bad will happen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Huge alien eggs opening in front of you? Just have a good look inside. What could possibly go wrong?!</li></ul><br/><br/>The list of stupid decisions just goes on and on AND ON!<br/><br/>While visually the film is generally excellent, the all-CGI-Alien was a huge let-down. Personally I found it considerably less convincing than the practical effects used in Alien and Aliens, which is unforgivable considering the creature is what these films are all about!<br/><br/>Additionally the crew, apart from being imbeciles (as is usual under Mr Scott's direction these days), are also completely forgettable. I saw this movie last night and I can't remember a single character's name today. The one exception is David/Walter, and once again Fassbender does a great job. (Perhaps that's why there's two of them - to make up for a lack of any other decent characters).<br/><br/>The other problem narrative-wise is that both Prometheus and Covenant have actually served to make the Alien universe much SMALLER in my opinion. In the original Alien and Aliens, the creature was just an unknown organism from the far reaches of the universe, and all the more scary because of it. (The same went for the Space Jockey for that matter). But these new movies have tried to tie it all back to humanity in some way - i.e. the Engineers (who are also the Space Jockeys) created both humanity and the black oil virus, and then the Xenomorph was apparently created by David (who was in turn created by man) somehow doing some genetic tinkering with the black oil and human DNA, while living in a cave and playing with his flute. Far from expanding the Alien universe, both these prequels have actually shrunk it by making man the centre of everything, while at the same time managing to sanitise and neuter one of the greatest movie creatures of all time. So what Ridley Scott is saying is that the entire Alien series and the iconic Xenomorph itself was just created by a deranged android with God/daddy issues. How very pathetic and disappointing. I personally hate it when movies try to explain everything to the millionth degree because it invariably ends up as a massive anticlimax. What was wrong with the Xenomorph just being some hideous unknown life-form from the far reaches of space???<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but there's a word limit here.<br/><br/>Lastly, the end is just pretty feeble and anticlimactic. The CG- Alien just kind of gets killed and that's it. And the *ahem* \"twist\" with David/Walter could be seen from a mile away, although David wouldn't have had anywhere near enough time to cut his own arm off and change his clothes and hairstyle.<br/><br/>Please PLEASE Mr Scott, stand aside and let Neill Blomkamp have his shot at an Aliens sequel.<br/><br/>A generous 2 Stars. One for the visuals that are once again gorgeous, and one for a great effort from Fassbender.",
    "Spectre was a classy action movie....making the expected James Bond signatures always look new. loved the suave and class of our favourite British spy. Daniel Craig just re-immersed us in giving us another classic to relish for years.",
    "I'll be honest, I don't think any of the reviewers that have given this movie 10 stars have seen any episodes of the show pre-2000.<br/><br/>I went into the movie thinking it would probably be decent. I figured it would probably be in the style of the newer episodes but with better overall material. That's pretty much how it turned out. Anyone who says it was a return to the older *better* Simpsons is kidding themselves.<br/><br/>The Simpsons greatness was based, in my opinion, on two things: characters that we imagine existing in our society (think the comic book guy, Moe, Flanders) and simply hilarious and very quotable lines. This formula has since been replaced by humor that is situationally based, and quite frankly, just not very funny.<br/><br/>I saw this movie yesterday afternoon, and I can hardly think of one line that had me cracking up. There were some funny moments, yes, but nothing comparable to the brilliant one-liners from the show's glory years.",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in \"Mrs Brown\". \"The Young Victoria\" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.<br/><br/>There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.<br/><br/>Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.<br/><br/>Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford's attempt on Victoria's life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria's accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a \"Regency Order\"; the Duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.<br/><br/>There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a \"Danger! Major cliché ahead!\" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in \"Moulin Rouge\").<br/><br/>The main reason for the film's success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make \"The Young Victoria\" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10",
    "While watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of films and TV shows from my youth, first was any of the original Godzilla films, the second, a TV show Ultra Man. The FX were way better here, but, it just made me think of them. I found the film entertaining, no Oscar winner, but, it was good. Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of course, rooting for the good guys.<br/><br/>I also had to think that mankind would have or could have thought of a better defense/offense weapon than giant robots. To bring a fight into the city would have cost trillions of dollars, perhaps Quadrillions of dollars. Okay, I'm reading way to much into it. Watch the movie, you will enjoy it.",
    "June 8, 2002 was an 80's renaissance for me. Playing an emulated ColecoVision on my PC, listening to Huey Lewis, Prince, and Men At Work, watching the A-Team on TNN, and seeing this film from 1989. I still enjoy the decade of feathered mullets, jerri-curled hair, acid-washed jeans, skinny ties, dominant pop music, and terrible fashions. The 90's will never have that to live down (except terrible fashions, but not as bad).<br/><br/>When Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure became the surprise hit of 1989, it made a star of everyone's favorite Lebanese-Canadian-U.S. rock 'n rolling actor, Keanu Reeves, who is one of the top stars at the box office today and one of the few likeable people in Tinseltown. It seems that he still carries a bit of Theodore \"Ted\" Logan in all his movies.<br/><br/>He and Alex Winter (an indie film dynamo) play Bill and Ted, a couple of 80's California dudes who want to start their own rock band (Wyld Stallyons). However, both are flunking in high school and will be expelled unless they get an A+ in history. To make matters worse, Ted will be sent to the military by his father, therefore squashing their dreams of rock stardom. Enter Rufus (George Carlin), a man from the future who plays Clarence to the boys George (shades of It's A Wonderful Life) who gives them a telephone booth. With it, they decide to use it to collect great historical figures and bring them to San Dimas, California to show them how mankind has evolved.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film holds up today. Bill and Ted are truly likeable boneheads and both Reeves and Winter deliver fine performances. Carlin is funny in his appearances, showing that he doesn't need trash-talk to be entertaining. The dialogue is truly amusing, probably because no one talks like that any more. The only weakness is that it's an 80's film, so if you didn't grow up in that era, you might not understand why there's music playing throughout the film, or why everyone looks and dresses so weird (yes, that's how everyone looked in the 1980's). The DVD version is quite nice, but it only has a trailer as a bonus. Still, a must watch, and much better than all the copycat films (including the horrible Dude, Where's My Car?). Party On!",
    "The future of movies doesn't seem too bright since all we're getting are remakes, adaptations and unnecessary prequels/sequels and that's why original stuff like SOURCE CODE can really make my day.<br/><br/>Honestly, the trailers and initial premise didn't seem promising; some soldier can travel back in time and has to stop an some evil terrorist from bombing America. At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it.<br/><br/>Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. <br/><br/>To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.",
    "\"The Godfather: Part II\" is a very suspenseful drama with a very exciting story, with great acting and great special effects. I would definitely recommend you watch this movie...but first watch the original classic from 1972 \"The Godfather\" . The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel.",
    "Well, I'll tell you what. I'm not a big fan of animated features but this one was a blast and a half. Just when I thought Flash the Sloth at the Zootown DMV couldn't be topped, we wind up meeting Mr. Big doing the Marlon Brando \"Godfather\" bit. I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn't run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn't stop laughing.<br/><br/>I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis's Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.<br/><br/>As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like 'being all you can be' and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I'll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - \"I want to try even though I could fail...\". It's a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don't measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message.",
    "I really enjoy the Star Trek TV series (original, TNG and DS9) and admit that I am late to this review. As much as I enjoy Star Trek and its ideals I had watched Star Wars The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams and I hated that. Star Wars rebooted with completely non-plot for pre-teens and one-liners, wise-cracks and plot holes so big that even Donald Trump's ego could drive through them was not for me.<br/><br/>So, anyway with a certain amount of hesitation I finally watched the reboot of Star Trek.... and it was as bad as I feared. Since it was expected I was not disappointed, but by gosh what is with the people who hire the director JJ Abrams? He makes every character a cartoon character. Never mind that the utopian and progressive society of the Federation is completely glossed over and ignored, but these characters with the formulaic backgrounds and corny lines and false tensions is just terrible. The Vulcans and Romulans' feud has never been as cliché-ridden I would say.<br/><br/>Look, I get it. People pay for reboots and remakes and sequels and so Hollywood serves them up (or is it the other way around?), but use some imagination, have one novel or original idea at least. I am too old for cartoons... which explains why I won't be watching the next Star Trek or fifteen Star Wars coming out. Obviously the director JJ Abrams is specialized in reboots and remakes and sequels and not original ideas.",
    "First off, let me state emphatically that I'm referring to the REAL version of the film, not the pathetic crippled creature distributed as \"Warriors of the Wind\" on video. Although I must admit that I first fell in love with the movie in that form, I have now seen the full subtitled version, and I place a hideous curse on those who hacked over 20 minutes from its running time.<br/><br/>Although the incredible \"Princess Mononoke\" later upstaged this early work in terms of art and detail, in many ways I still prefer \"Nausicaa\". Its imaginitive and well-conceived world puts me in mind of Dune with its feuding factions, its giant creatures, and its strong ecological message. Even with a rather long running time, the story moves very briskly (boiled down as it was from a very lengthy manga series). The music deserves special mention, as well, as it is a large step up from the electronic pop stylings of most anime.<br/><br/>If you can get your hands on a copy of the original version, you'll find it more than worth the effort.",
    "I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.",
    "SPOILER: This movie was just magical.<br/><br/>The Force has become like Harry Potter magic, with a new spell every day or so.<br/><br/>Rey is just magical. With practically training whatsoever she can take on Luke and Kylo and win.<br/><br/>Snoke is magical. He appeared out of nowhere in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi has such fantastic Force powers (never before seen in the entire Star Wars Universe) and yet can't tell when his protege is scheming to slice him in two (but could fell his every throught earlier, and even manipulate him and Rey's thoughts and get them to intergalactically Skype each other and even send water through space).<br/><br/>Luke is magical. He can magically project himself light years away and even bring solid things (the lucky dice) with him. Then dies magically for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Yoda is magical. His Force-ghost actually has more Force powers than when he was alive! Calling down lightning from the sky??? Heck, why don't the Jedi just do that when fighting on Tattooine or whatever? And if Force-ghosts still have Force powers why not the whole gang of Anakin, Ben and Yoda take on Snoke?<br/><br/>Rose is magical. She appears out of nowhere and just happens to go along with Finn on a completely unnecessary mission to find a code breaker, and find not one but TWO code breakers, one of which is in the SAME CELL as they are. I mean, is that magical or what?<br/><br/>Leia is magical. Previously in 7 movies only having the barest abilities in the Force, she now can survive in space for quite a long time and even open her eyes without getting them immediately frozen, and Force-Mary Poppins herself back to the space ship. Magical!<br/><br/>I could go on and on. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it's one shameless Deus Ex Machina after another. And don't even get me started on the stupid feminist nonsense, the inane attempt at comedy, the stupid characters who go nowhere in their characterisation, the stupid casino subplot, the stupid \"saving\" of Finn who wanted to sacrifice himself by Rose who magically now has feeling for him and both of them magically survive without getting shot at by the entire First Order army. Oops, I did go on and on.<br/><br/>If you make a movie, you need to make sure your movie stays in the universe it came from. Not invent new rules, new powers, new super villains, new behaviours from old characters, etc. out of bloody nowhere.",
    "A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>\nDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says \"Russell Crowe\", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a \"hunk\" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.<br/><br/>And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.<br/><br/>And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.<br/><br/>At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",
    "Tony D'Amato(Al Pacino) is the head coach of the Miami Sharks who are owned by the Christina Pagniacci(Cameron Diaz) who is using the Miami Franchise only for profit. Trouble stirs up after long time star quarterback Cap Rooney(Dennis Quaid)is injured along with his back up bringing in third string quarterback Willie Beamen(Jamie Foxx) who becomes the face of the franchise after having great game after great game. The only problem is that he plays only with his head and not with his heart, with an aging team that needs an emotional leader to guide them to victory. Also Starring: James Woods, Matthew Modine, LL Cool J, Bill Bellemy, Lawrence Taylor, Charelton Heston, Aaron Eckhart, and John C. McGinley.<br/><br/>In a cinema that rarely produces pro football movies, this is the cream of the crop. It captures the reality along with the heroic story of a nobody rising to the top. The movie is humorous, dramatic, and a thriller for all sports fans.<br/><br/>This is not only one of Oliver Stone's best films but this is also the start of Jamie Foxx's \"good\" acting career. Forget what the critics said about Collateral or Ray being the beginning for Jamie Foxx. It was Any Given Sunday. Willie Beaman is a complex character and Foxx nailed the part. He was magnificent. He played the part to perfection and out shined the great Al Pacino. The supporting cast was also incredible with great performances from Cameron Diaz, LL Cool J, James Woods, and surprisingly John C. McGinley. It is very rare to find a great dramatic football movie but this is definitely one those small few.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the greatest sports movies of all time and it is highly enjoyable for adult audiences.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.<br/><br/>No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that, you're probably going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.<br/><br/>No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.<br/><br/>The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.<br/><br/>Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.<br/><br/>It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.<br/><br/>That being said, the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.<br/><br/>I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed & bigger budgeted movies, it will be a movie like this one, that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.<br/><br/>And while we're at it, hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive, well acted portrayal.",
    "From hit or miss comedy to Get Out, Jordan Peele proves to us that he has certainly matured as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Get Out is one of the best and most refreshingly original horror movies in the last decade.\nRather than having in your face predictable jump scares and cheesy music, Get Out dwells on the mind and relies on the fear of the unknown while giving subtle messages on racism and what's it like to be black in America and for an anti-racism movie everything is handled very well due to Peele's great writing.\nAs I've already mentioned the best aspect of Get Out is the writing; the characters are intelligent people and behave like logical human beings instead of cliché horror movie idiots. Everything happens for a reason and there is a meaning behind everything. Also unlike other horror movie clichés Get Out doesn't fake its scares or replaces them with needless humour. Instead, the humour (mainly Lil Rel Howery's character) is perfectly balanced with the story and shows up at adequate times.<br/><br/>Creepy, unsettling and filled with brilliant performances (primarily from Daniel Kaluuya) and even better writing, Get Out perfectly represents the US society in its current era.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8+/10",
    "SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.<br/><br/>The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to \"weed out all non-hackers\". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes \"Cowboy\" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes \"Gomer Pyle\" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. <br/><br/>The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.<br/><br/>The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined \"hours of boredom, seconds of terror\" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. <br/><br/>'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the \"duality of Man\" according to Jung. 10/10",
    "Similar to the first Ice Age, the promotional material for the sequel was out in the theatres way in advance, and courtesy of the Scrat character too, up to its usual antics of getting to that elusive acorn. Here, Scrat opens the movie, and emulating the style of the first, he provides most of the laughs, also as an intermission from the actual scenes from the main cast.<br/><br/>Our gang of prehistoric animals are back - Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabre-tooth Tiger (Denis Leary). We learn that Sid has gone into the early childhood business, educating the young minds of pre-historic brats. However, I felt that this movie was somehow darker in tone than the original. While the original was one which dealt with hope, this one had its setting in extinction, disaster and death.<br/><br/>The valley which they live in is threatened by the melting ice, no thanks to global warming. So all the animals embark on a journey to salvation, to that rumored ark which will save them from the massive floods to come. Along the way, our trio meets up with another trio of characters, who were added to expand the cast, featuring 2 Possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), and another, but female, mammoth (Queen Latifah).<br/><br/>Needless to say, Manny's still anti-social, and Diego can't get along with those rascal possums who get on his nerves, and Sid's the \"philosopher\" ever providing the laughs. Various themes like romance (hey, we got 2 mammoths here), friendship, trust, and believing in oneself to overcome one's phobia get covered. Pretty wide scope, but they manage to fit in place nicely.<br/><br/>The villains in this sequel are pretty nasty, besides the looming natural disaster, we have two sea creatures with nasty teeth and attitude, as well as menacing vultures ever ready to pounce on the flesh of animals who have fallen.<br/><br/>But it's not all that bleak. Keep a lookout too for that mad sloth song-and-dance sequence, which has potential to become the next ear worm ala Madagascar's zany \"you-got-to-move-it\" song. The animation is as usual, top notch, and I just can't get enough of the photo-realistic ice and water landscape.<br/><br/>This is one piece of animation that doesn't rely too much on sight gags, of spoofing current affairs, but one filled with more witty dialogue and kept on an even keel with its interesting storyline. Though at times it might feel clichéd, somehow it excelled in its execution.<br/><br/>And that makes this sequel, as enjoyable as, if not better, than the original. Recommended stuff this week!",
    "I was a Texas Western graduate in 1966 and attended the school all four previous years that Don Haskins (\"the Bear\") coached the basketball team. Of course, Coach Haskins came to TWC in 1961 and built his team over 5 years, not in one year as the movie tells it. I went to every home game in 1965-66 and remember every one as if it were yesterday. I watched all of the away games that were televised, including all of the games the Miners played in the NCAA tournament. Even though the producers of \"Glory Road\" took considerable artistic license, the story is mostly true. Here are some facts. The Miners blew away fourth ranked Iowa during a holiday tournament that season. It wasn't even close as the movie depicts it. The great comeback was against New Mexico in the \"Pit\". When Hispanic guard David Palacio came in to play in the second half, the team seemed to settle down and came from a 20 point deficit to win in overtime. The incredibly close game, and probably best game in America that year between the true best college teams in America was the Regional final between third ranked TWC and fourth ranked Kansas (not #1 Kentucky and #2 Duke in the final four semifinal), when Jo Jo White made that last second basket in overtime with his foot on the base line. The Miners went on to beat Kansas 81-80 in double overtime. Then the Miners beat Utah in the first game of the final four. If white player Jerry Armstrong hadn't defended against Utah's great Jerry Chambers, a black player, the Miners probably wouldn't have made it to the championship game against Kentucky. Chambers was beating every defender badly, including Lattin, Shed, and Flournoy, until Armstrong was put in to cover him. Chambers finished with 38 points, mostly in the first half and was the tournament's MVP.<br/><br/>Coach Haskins is beloved by every El Pasoan, whether living in the city now or not, and is a true American treasure. It's wonderful for the rest of the country and the world to finally learn about \"the Bear\" and his great 1966 Miner team that El Paso has known and loved for 40 years. It's much more than a basketball story, it's a story about tolerance and what hard work and discipline can do through the leadership and determination of a great coach and human being.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, especially Josh Lucas' performance as \"the Bear\". His performance was spot on. The young actors playing on the team were outstanding. The early tensions shown between the black and white players in the movie did not exist according to the real players on that team. The book \"Glory Road\" is a must read, because it tells the true story told by \"the Bear\", Don Haskins, himself. I also recommend David Lattin's book \"Slam Dunk to Glory\". The producers should have shown the real life characters, including Coach Haskins, Pat Riley, and some of the actual 1966 players earlier in the credits, because most of the audiences leave the theater without knowing they're going to be interviewed. I thought that was the most interesting part of the movie. The movie and the story deserve a perfect 10. I hope it wins some awards.",
    "Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot in the way of story and character development, but suffice it to say, it serves its purpose. What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. The pop culture references are still present, but I found them to be more clever and funny this time around, and in much smaller amounts. I was smiling through virtually the entire film, and had about 5 or 6 hard laugh-out-loud moments throughout. As expected, I was also very impressed by the voice cast in this movie. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen's performance as B.O.B.. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway.<br/><br/>The 3D, while not used as effectively as it was in Coraline, is still one of the more impressive showcasings that I've seen, and that's largely due to the film's incredible action sequences. Seriously, this is some of the best action that I've seen in an animated film; as far as I'm concerned, it's right up there with that of The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Monsters vs. Aliens to be a surprisingly entertaining film, with clever and witty dialogue, as well as terrific action. I'm not usually in favor of sequels, but if they're able to keep it as balanced and charming, I would honestly like to see this become a successful, long-running franchise. Nice job, folks at DreamWorks Animation.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.<br/><br/>He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.<br/><br/>Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",
    "\"Not only is Singer's film-making aesthetically frustrating (lacking coherent visual rhythm) but his juvenile regard of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler -- one of 15 documented attempts -- is intellectually insulting...\" New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film.

A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in.

I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...<br/><br/>What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.<br/><br/>It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.<br/><br/>If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that \"I was on the edge of my seat\" throughout the second half of the film.<br/><br/>So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.",
    "This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "\"I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time\", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use \"the weapon\".<br/><br/>There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "I love watching movies that leave you just thinking at the end. This movie really did that. Now I'm not really sure why it has such bad reviews but i really liked it and would definitely recommend watching it. <br/><br/>Its not another end of the world movie where your main characters saves their family and end up surviving at the end, which is something i liked because it shows how Nick cages's character has to cope with knowing that him and his family will die and theirs no stopping it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ending and how everything comes together at the end to show that this is Gods doing. You would never expect that from the way its played out, other than the foreshadowing from his son talking about not believing god at the beginning",
    "The first time I saw this film, I was suitably impressed but found I couldn't enjoy it completely.  In order to keep up with the relentless pace of the plot, I didn't pay as much attention to the writing and the performances as I should have.  When it was over, I felt the breakneck pace of the story overshadowed the screenplay and acting, rendering the film an accomplished reprisal of fact but not much else.<br/><br/>What a difference a second viewing made.  My familiarity with the plot allowed me to appreciate all the finer details of the film.   Watching Redford and Hoffman's disciplined performances as Woodward and Bernstein, for instance, is like watching two expert tennis players work in tandem with one another.  When they act together, there is a delightful give-and-take, two masters working their way into a wonderful groove.  While they appear steady and reserved on the surface, the two actors radiate a noticeable undercurrent of excitement and dread, as if underneath their stern countenances they're screaming, \"Holy sh*t!  I can't believe we're doing this!!\"  Redford, not the strongest dramatic actor, finds his normal-guy niche here and gives one of his best performances.  Hoffman is equally strong, making even the simplest scene seem like a masterpiece (the \"count to 10\" phone scene comes to mind).<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Pakula communicates the idea of these two reporters being completely outnumbered by the people responsible for the Watergate break-in.  I loved the numerous overhead shots of Woodward and Bernstein that pull up, up, up, until they're nothing more than specks in the dirty streets of DC.  (This technique is also used in the classic scene where the two guys are searching through old records and the camera pulls up to the ceiling and shows them seated along the edge of a circular series of desks.)<br/><br/>The film rockets right along, leaving the viewers as excited over the reporters' discoveries as they are.  William Goldman's script helps in this regard, I think, sticking straight to the meat and cutting out any unnecessary roughage.  The dialogue gets right down to business while working in realistic vocal habits and the like.  Redford really captures this well (listen to his stammering and self-corrections when he talks on the phone to sources - great stuff!).<br/><br/>I can't recommend \"All the President's Men\" enough.  It's tightly-structured, fiercely-paced, and captivating as all get-out.  If necessary, watch it twice: once to find out who's who, the second time to savour the handiwork.  If you want to talk more about it, leave a red flag on the potted plant on your balcony.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "Definitely not my favorite of the 3 but it's hard when the first 2 were just that good. It still portrays well, from my historical knowledge, much of the struggle of the mob families to legitimize their business dealings and try to enjoy life in the later age of the mafia in America. Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films.",
    "Please take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really write reviews, but I really felt compelled to say something about this movie and it's decaying genre.<br/><br/>I'm conflicted, because I know my opinion is getting more and more jaded with every new superhero flick- but I am quickly reaching the end of my rope here. All these movies feel so predictable and cliché anymore, and as much as I truly want to enjoy them it is becoming more and more difficult.<br/><br/>The main actors in this movie were pretty good, but what can you do with yet another weak story that has already been rehashed in other films. The writing felt subpar, and in the end it came off as being full of gimmicks and convenient sub plot.<br/><br/>It just doesn't feel real anymore, it doesn't feel believable. It feels like a fantasy world created for superfans who never take a step back and critique.<br/><br/>These superhero movies are becoming more and more uninspired, and while I try to give them all a chance I am just getting tired of it all. It feels like the quality is being diluted, all that matters anymore is the quantity. All that matters is the money.<br/><br/>I still hold out hope- just look at the 'zombie' genre. Just because there is dilution within the genre doesn't mean a sporadic gem can't be made. However, if you are of a similar mindset as me, you might want to keep looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!",
    "No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in \"10 Rillington Place\" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in \"American Psycho\". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",
    "There are few elements that actually work in this prequel, but none of them are enough to compensate for the lack of creativity, poor execution, terrible writing and awful looking special effects, ruining what it could've been a potentially promising spin-off from a great character.",
    "Amistad is a very well crafted, well acted, and well told story. It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad 'mutiny', and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America's darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.<br/><br/>Amistad ranks as one of McConaughey's finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. <br/><br/>Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.",
    "A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands' competition.<br/><br/>Unbelievable? Yes. What's more unbelievable is that somehow the whole thing works  Jack Black's over-the-top enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, the edge-of-disaster suspense is continued throughout the length of the movie, and by the end the audience is so desperate to see how the kids (who they all play their own instruments by the way) perform in the concert that seat wetting would probably go unnoticed. Joan Cusack, as the gobsmacked headmistress, delivers a performance that is worth the price of your cinema ticket in itself. Achieving such tears-down-the cheeks laughter and adrenalin-packed excitement for air guitar music is nothing short of miraculous.<br/><br/>School of Rock is a movie that promises entertainment and delivers. Everything is as it says on the packet. For sheer feelgood factor, this movie is unbeatable  and you can even take the kids!",
    "No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. Because they don't need to. The Spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are. But that doesn't mean they should not try to. Why did this movie get made? Simple, Sam Raimi wasn't given enough time to make a fourth spider-man film so he quit, and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen. This movie wasn't made for any other reason.<br/><br/>First off, Peter Parker doesn't have a goal in this movie. At first its to find out what happened to his parents, which isn't explained in this movie. After half an hour he now tries to control his new powers, in scenes that don't help the audience. In the original spider-man, Peter learned about his powers in a controlled environment, he didn't beat up innocent people on a subway train. It's nice to know no one on that train reported that a man beat up five people while climbing walls. But Peter learning his powers can't be an entire focus in the movie, so we kill Uncle Ben. This time it doesn't work because the only reason Peter let the criminal get away was because Peter couldn't get a chocolate milk. To get so upset that he couldn't afford a chocolate milk that he would let a robber get away with the stores money is a contrivance in every way. So for about ten minutes Peters new goal is to bring uncle Ben's murderer to justice, let the police can't link all these look alike criminals spider-man does capture with the man who did kill peters uncle. After a while he just stops doing this, with no reason! And there is still about an hour left, so what are we going to do now? How about introduce that main villain you've been promising us? The Lizard is horribly written in every scene he's in. Why does he go to so much trouble to knock cars off of a bridge just to tell one guy (who is never seen afterwords) that their vaccine isn't ready yet? Because we needed another action scene. After that they bring up that the daily bugle wants pictures of the lizard, a point that doesn't amount to anything, except the lizard finding out who spider-man is. For someone as smart as Peter Parker has been set up to be it was really stupid for him to put his name on the camera he was using to take pictures of the lizard.<br/><br/>The climax doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first being this is the same climax we've seen in about four other superhero movies. The second one being there are no stakes. Only half of Manhattan would be infected 8 minutes after the lizard started his chemical missile, decreasing the people at risk greatly. Also THERE'S A CURE FOR THIS!! You know, the thing Gwen has been working on for the past 6 minutes? Whoever gets infected can just get the cure shot into them afterwords, and as of right now there are only 10 people infected, so why waster your time trying to put the cure into the missile that will stretch half of Manhattan and only effect 10 people?! <br/><br/>Gwen Stacy's dad dies and tells Peter to leave Gwen out of this, and proceeds to still date Gwen. What a great way to respect someone who died protecting people! Don't watch this movie, don't waste your time with this movie, even Spiderman 3 was better than this, so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy, at least those movies had effort put into them.",
    "I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. <br/><br/>I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "2012's Magic Mike wasn't exactly about the stripping. Sure, it features a lot of it, but the real center of the movie was the lifestyle of its main character, Mike. This latest installment showcases more of the crew and how they put up the show. It's more choreography driven than some commentary, which actually made it more appropriate to this material. It still has the stunning style of the first one, though it mostly feels quite forced, but if the movie tries to be itself, then there it actually shines. Magic Mike XXL indeed brings much of what you expect from it.<br/><br/>While the first movie basically shows the art of its aesthetics, this sequel rather shows the art of stripping. The story isn't quite remarkable; it's so simple that it's nothing more than an excuse to show more of these acts, which is both a good thing and otherwise. But really, that's what the target audience really came here for. Just like the first one, it's all atmosphere than following a plot. We just see these characters trying to get along, hint some commentary, and do some stripping. The difference however is the stripping is the real showcase, as in the direction and choreography improves within that aspect which makes these performances speak what this movie is truly about. People would immediately think that this would only appeal female viewers, but even as a straight man as I am, I would actually be impressed by the choreography displayed on those scenes.<br/><br/>The direction does try to keep Soderbergh's style going in this sequel, though only eschewing the intense sepia and welcoming other colors on the daylight. The new style is sometimes indefinite, specifically the vague lighting in some scenes, but then, the movie eventually breaks the pretense once the characters start dancing on screen, having more focus on their moves, and of course, bodies. Star, Channing Tatum, still has the charm as he always has. The other performers also get their characters expanded, staying natural whenever they bond and fight off on screen, treating them beyond than typical eye candy compared to the first one.<br/><br/>Many may call Magic Mike XXL a totally needless sequel or a cash grab for those who seek for more endless dose of shirtless men, but I believe this movie actually exists to make up for its own value. The story may not be as meaty as its predecessor's, but it shows everything what its audiences actually wanted for it. And it is done elegantly, proving that stripping apparently has more to offer than just lust for flesh. It sounds incredibly weird if you say it that way, but looking at these performances seems like this is an art that we didn't see coming. Again, there's nothing remarkable about the story, though if you're curious about the appeal of this career, then it gives a room for fascination.",
    "I give this movie a 10 because it has a message. It has a true purpose to it, which effects nearly every man on the planet.<br/><br/>Ladies, you can listen to this, but be reasonable. Guys, we all masturbate. Some of us do it more than others, most of us look at porn. Some of us only masturbate to porn and some of us have real hard fetishes.<br/><br/>This movie points to the problem, the process of porn turning our heads, making us believe in perfection and making us ultimately selfish as lovers.<br/><br/>You watch porn, you don't have to please a woman, you don't have to worry about anyone but yourself. It is all perfect. In the real world, in relationships, the other person matters just as much as you, but sometimes, even the real thing is not as good as the fantasy and the ease of it.<br/><br/>Don Jon is about that confusion of liking and appreciating porn more than real women, of becoming addicted to the idea of 'perfection' and the ultimate realization of the effect it has on all us men, making us irritated little boys, incapable of truly connecting with another person.<br/><br/>The message is not that porn is bad, only the way we think and use it is misleading to reality.<br/><br/>But, this is not the type of movie to watch with the family, the girl; it's funny, but not a comedy in a spoof and clown type of way. Watch this movie alone, think about yourself and how porn effects you. It will benefit you greatly.",

That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.<br/><br/>This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.<br/><br/>The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.<br/><br/>I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.<br/><br/>I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.<br/><br/>This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it.

Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant \"hungry for more.\" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.<br/><br/>Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful.

    "# ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE TRANSMISSION THROUGH A SUBWAVELENGTH NANO-HOLE IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL PLASTONIC LAYER\n\n# Srinivasan Gopalakrishnan, Yonghua Du, and Zhijie Zhao\n\n# Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Kansas,\n# Box 9025, Lawrence, KS 66045\n\n# Abstract:\n\n# Abstract\n\n#\n\n# We have numerically simulated the transmission of an electromagnetic\n# wave across a one dimensional nano hole with a large hole to diameter\n# ratio. The nano hole is realized by a circular groove machined in a\n# two-dimensional plasmonic layer. One end of the layer is illuminated by a\n# Gaussian beam with a circular polarization. We have observed the\n# formation of a standing wave pattern due to interference between the wave\n# travelling across the groove and the leaky wave along the edge of the\n# groove. While analyzing the standing wave pattern we identify the regions\n# of transmission and diffraction of the incident beam. We note that the\n# standing wave pattern is completely asymmetric with respect to the\n# polarization of the incident beam. The asymmetric transmission of the\n# standing wave pattern is due to the anisotropic plasmonic properties of\n# the two-dimensional layer. The maximum transmission of the standing wave\n# pattern is noted for a circular polarization of incident beam. The\n# dependence of the transmission of the standing wave pattern on the\n# polarization of the incident beam is quantified using the ellipticity of\n# the transmitted beam. Our analysis shows that the ellipticity of the\n# transmitted beam is in the range - to 6 x 10-6.\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nAn electromagnetic wave propagating inside a host medium is known to\nundergo reflection, refraction and scattering at any interface between the\nmedium of interest and the surrounding medium.

    "“Attractors, or points in the space that attract states of the system into their vicinity, are of fundamental importance to the behavior of many dynamical systems. A prominent class of attractors for dynamical systems are fixed points, which are points that attract orbits of a continuous dynamical system into their vicinity. Here, we consider dynamical systems with a discrete time step whose states are governed by functions mapping a real-valued parameter and an internal state to an internal state. This class of dynamical systems includes systems frequently used to describe biological networks, in which a network of species is described by iterating a function that depends on a parameter and the internal state. For example, in the “Ott-Antonsen-function” for metabolic networks, the function representing each species involves the species’ current level and a parameter which is a time-dependent mass balance for this species. In this case, the parameter represents the current resource intake for growth and maintenance of the cells, and the internal state is the species’ current level in the network. For the Ott-Antonsen network, the fixed points correspond to the metabolically optimal states, in which the resource uptake is precisely as much as it is sufficient for maintaining the species’ level. However, it is much more than is required to maintain only the optimal fixed point. We study the influence of the parameter’s value on this behavior. We consider a specific example for a small signaling network and derive analytic expressions as well as estimate the effect numerically using Gillespie simulations. We find that for parameters that are too large, the system can exhibit multiple stable limit cycles. For each such set of parameters, the network can be characterized as having several attractors: the stable fixed points, which can also be unstable limit cycles for parameters within this set, as well as unstable limit cycles that are unstable fixed points for other parameters within this set. If the parameter is too small, the system can exhibit oscillations between two attractors that are stable fixed points for lower and higher values of the parameter, respectively. Our analysis helps characterize the existence of stable and unstable fixed points as well as unstable limit cycles within a network. We discuss the possible impacts of variations in the resource availability on different network components due to this behavior and highlight the importance of the network’s parameter in designing and interpreting experiments on biological networks.”\nThe following is",
    "Current state-of-the-art approaches for few-shot image segmentation rely either on large external datasets or a meta-learner for the adaptation of the model to the target domain. However, acquiring large volumes of data for every new domain in medical imaging is costly while the meta-learners are also data hungry. We present a novel concept that leverages existing segmentation methods without the need for large amounts of data or a meta-learner. We use the global correlation between the object and the background together with the object shape prior. We demonstrate the proposed concept on the cardiac and pelvic segmentation datasets. Our experiments on three different networks show that the proposed concept can improve the overall performance even for state-of-the-art networks. We demonstrate that our concept provides the following benefits: improves training speed by up to 50%, increases segmentation accuracy with up to 40% on 3D data and achieves a 2.2 - 4.3 times lower computational cost than state-of-the-art meta-learners. We also show that our approach is robust to both the number of training images and the type of backbone network.\nAn article in Computer Vision Zone, June 22, 2021, explains the research paper from arxiv.org. The following is a quotation from the article that summarizes some of the key benefits of the research paper:\nUsing the global correlation and the shape prior for few-shot medical Image segmentation improves the overall performance. This concept does not require meta-learners and therefore large training datasets with the same domain. This leads to a reduction of computational effort and saves training time.\nI wrote the following comment on the Computer Vision Zone article:\nThe fact that you state in this article there are four key benefits to using the global correlation and shape prior for few-shot medical image segmentation and using the meta-learners does not require large training datasets that are the same domain should be made perfectly clear in a title for any press release that is intended to inform the reader quickly. As currently written in the article, I think, there will be readers who miss the key benefits of the research paper and are only focused on using the meta-learners does not require large training datasets that are the same domain.\nI was happy to be the recipient of the research paper that I received as it is definitely",

    "A meticulous object segmentation approach, the result of which is that only non-important objects are removed (eg., the grass, the road, the sky), and important objects are preserved (eg., a human, animal, or vehicle). The main step is to first perform semantic segmentation, and then refine the pixel mask of the corresponding segmentation results by using the instance attention module by re-scanning the instance segmentation results. We adopt U-Net as the semantic segmentation network backbone and Mask R-CNN as the instance segmentation network backbone. The proposed segmentation method has the following characteristics: 1) High precision. 2) Non-important objects (such as grass, sky) are completely removed, and important objects (such as an animal) are preserved.\nThe following is the full text of the abstract for a research paper titled \"Inducing and Learning Non-Adversarial Examples for Robust Object Detector\" from arxiv.org, by authors Yixuan Cheng1, Qiao Chen, Jianhua Gong and Jiefeng Deng.\nRobust object detectors are expected to have similar performance even for input images with slight perturbations. State-of-the-art methods typically rely on adversarial samples with strong perturbations to train these robust detectors. But there is still a big performance gap between adversarial training and supervised training. We proposed an approach to inducing and learning non-adversarial examples (INLE). The key idea of INLE is to induce non-adversarial examples as well as learn their relationships. Two modules are proposed to achieve this goal. One is IN module for inducing non-adversarial examples from adversarial ones, the other is LEN module for learning non-adversarial examples from adversarial ones. Specifically, IN module first learns to map adversarial examples to their original input space by GAN-based models, and then refines the generated non-adversarial examples by the guidance of the adversarial examples. LEN module, on the other hand, is to learn the non-adversarial examples from adversarial ones with a L2 normalization loss. We have compared the results with baseline networks (ie., Faster RCNN, SSD) and adversarial networks (ie., AIF, AAM), and the results demonstrate that our INLE has the potential to improve the performances of detectors substantially.

To avoid this, we could add to it an informal \\emph{inconsistency semantics}, which declares that an inconsistent theory is ill-formed; or we could consider the so-called \\emph{subsystem} semantics, which considers as valid every \\emph{subsystem} of the Martin-L\\\"of type theory consisting of all the type-forming meta-variables in the theory \\cite{cade}.

The intuition is that the models in the class of models corresponds one-to-one to the truth values of the formula itself.\n\nThis semantic framework is general enough that it can be applied to the set-theoretic type theories as well.\nThis style of semantics also has the virtue of being extensional, because we are assigning \\textit{sets} of models to types instead of functions from models to truth values.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\",
    "> The idea of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling is to use more costly data to enhance information learned from cheaper data. Multi-fidelity models have recently attracted increasing attention, particularly in the areas of data mining and machine learning, in recent years. A general formulation of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling can be defined as learning a surrogate model from data collected from multiple distinct data sources. The data on which surrogate models are built usually depend on different aspects, e.g., data quality, data quantity, and/or data complexity. Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling has been successfully applied to a broad range of problems in many areas such as finance and engineering disciplines. Nevertheless, the success of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling relies on the understanding of the key challenges and research problems of building accurate and efficient multi-fidelity surrogate models.\n> \n> This article provides an overview of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling. We first introduce the background of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling. Then, we review some key issues in the construction of multi-fidelity surrogate models, including surrogate model structure, fidelity definition, and fidelity selection. Furthermore, we review multi-objective multi-fidelity surrogate modeling, multi-fidelity response surface modeling, and multi-fidelity global optimization. Finally, we identify some promising areas of research in multi-fidelity surrogate modeling by introducing some open problems of current work that should be solved in the future. We hope that researchers can identify some potential research problems and directions in multi-fidelity surrogate modeling from this review article.\n\n## [Learning multi-fidelity GP models for PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767)\n\nThe following is the full text of the abstract for a research paper titled \"Learning multi-fidelity GP models for PDEs\" from arxiv.org:\n\n> We consider learning multi-fidelity models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) where we have access to both high-fidelity (highly accurate but expensive-to-simulate) and low-fiutility (less accurate but cheap-to-simulate) model data.

All modern arrays consist of active RF (radio frequency) chains which contain phase-shifters.\n\"active antennas\" can mean a whole variety of things. For instance, antennas with phased arrays (also commonly called \"active array antennas\" or \"adaptive array antennas\") are commonly used for phased array radar and satellite communications. They consist of an array of antennas, each connected to a separate radio frequency chain consisting of phase-shifters controlled by a digital computer. This allows you to do digital beamforming on the incoming signals, so you get the ability to change the size and location of the receiving beam, as well as the direction it points.\nIn order to work, a reflectarray like this requires a signal generator or transmitter at each antenna. The signals need to be matched and then combined into one signal, and this means they need to be at the same frequency. In order to provide beamforming, the signals need to be time-aligned, and that usually means using a common frequency reference with a signal synchronized from it, or else using a special waveform which provides time-alignment as the receiver's input.\n\"Digital-controlled reflectarray\" is what would be properly termed as \"adaptive",

    "\"We introduce the graphical language of quantum error correction and show that any scheme is equivalently specified by a diagram made of gates from some finite set and that this diagram is a normal form.\nWe provide a framework within which various aspects of the physical implementation as well as the logical design of qubits can be dealt with at one single level. We can show then that any error correction code, or any logical block encoding any function such as permutation of qubits, is equivalent to a diagram. Moreover, we show that the number of qubits in such diagrams grows sub-extensively with the size of the input. We show then that this graphical language is a convenient notation to verify any construction or analysis. In particular, we show how any decoding algorithm or stabilizer formalism can be translated into the graphical language. With these tools, we show that the optimal syndrome measurement (which we can view as a quantum computer) can be specified by a diagram with logarithmic depth in the size of the code with constant width. The equivalence between any diagram and any error correction code allows us then to give a new representation of such codes as a concatenation of many \"layers\", each layer corresponding to a concatenation of one qubit codes. This representation leads us to our main result that stabilizer encoding and decoding for the surface code can be done with constant depth quantum circuits, and allows us to improve the qubit complexity of the surface code to logarithmic. Furthermore we are able to extend several earlier results on the number of qubits and the depth required to simulate transversally quantum circuits. This new approach to quantum error correction shows how the diagram can be considered in some sense to replace both the usual encoding map and the physical Hamiltonian description of quantum error correction, in general.

    "Is a quantum computer, which is described by the laws of quantum mechanics, a physical, or a nonphysical, system? In this paper we show the quantum computer's operation does not depend on whether or not it is described by quantum mechanics. We show that a system which is not described by quantum mechanics can be engineered to operate as a quantum computer, provided it is designed to exploit the properties which exist in the laws of physics which underlie the dynamics of most systems, in particular energy degradation.\nA computer which requires energy degradation to function can be said to naturally utilize this property of its environment to realize its purpose. This type of computer is therefore nonphysical. A computer which does not require energy degradation to be maintained in existence requires nonphysical mechanisms to function which go beyond the laws of physics.

    "Referring image segmentation (RIS) task aims to predict a mask of the referential object in an image. It is important yet challenging to segment the query object from complex scenes, while some stateof- the-art methods have been proposed to address this problem. However, all of these methods ignore the inherent structure of the objects in the images at the instance-level. We argue that this structure should also be exploited, and accordingly construct a two-stage reference framework based on object proposal, as a general solution for RIS. It is worth noticing that, the object proposal based on referring expression has brought new challenges, i.e., lack of labeled dataset and the sparsity and ambiguity in the referring expression. For the former, we have taken an active learning approach to obtain a small amount of labeled data and utilized it to train our proposed framework. For the latter, we have proposed a new referring expression segmentation (RESeg) dataset to tackle the above problems. To verify the proposed framework, thorough experiments are performed on our new dataset and a benchmark segmentation dataset Pascal- Context. The results show the promise of our RIS framework.\nRIS Dataset Generation Code:\nFor the RESeg method, the authors use the MS COCO segmentation dataset to generate the dataset.

In this paper, we demonstrate that, with appropriate algorithmic parameters, the simulated annealing algorithm (a type of \"metaheuristic\" algorithm) can find good solutions to the general sensor location problem within reasonable computation times.

    "In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization problem for learning an optimal partitioning over a set of data points based only on pairwise similarities between data points. As a result, for example, when applied to image data, the partitioning algorithm can be used in image retrieval. The proposed learning procedure is simple, fast, scalable to large datasets, and uses a margin-based loss function. We demonstrate our approach on a set of benchmarks, showing superior performance over baseline systems.\n\nIn his own publication on the subject in 2010, [17], the same person wrote,\n\nPairwise metric learning approaches that require full training data can face computational challenges when the training data is particularly large or cannot be stored in memory. To address this, Kulis _et al._ [7] introduced a set-to-set framework, and in this framework proposed a new pairwise method called LMLSS, which is able to learn from very large datasets.\n\nThis is the _only_ scholarly work that uses the term \"metric learning\", which was first used in \"Large Margin Metric Learning for High-Dimensional Data\" by Hadsell and Schütze of 2006. The only scholarly work available that uses the term \"metric space\" is _Metric learning methods for image classification_, published in 2008, in which case it was used with reference to the work of Hadsell and Schütze.\n\nSince there are so many papers devoted to what is essentially the same approach, it is a fair question to ask why one would want to pursue alternative approaches. The question arises in the papers themselves:\n\nBecause it was designed for large scale problems, the framework has several limitations in the sense that LMLSS [6] is unable to properly utilize a training set which exhibits some peculiar feature spaces. LMLSS also fails to recognize a set with a large number of similar elements.

    "We propose a new approach for object recognition, where feature extraction is based on the sparse representation, but the dictionary elements are SDD. Our model is inspired by the observation, that certain classes of objects have well-defined contour in the image space. For example, car or bicycle shape can be described by relatively simple shape descriptor, whereas complex objects such as people or animals are harder to describe. We propose a framework, where the sparse codes for the individual contour patches are learnt and then the classification is performed by learning an appropriate linear combination of the sparsely represented features. Our framework is tested on three data sets: MIT-CMU object benchmark, SUN scene categorization and Caltech-101 scene data sets. We obtain improvements over the state-of-the-art for all of them using much simpler and computationally more efficient model. We also propose a novel method for learning of SDD elements online. We provide comparisons to related work, including object contour extraction, shape recognition and recent approaches to image classification based on sparse representation.\nRelated links from arxiv.org:\nhttp://www.arxiv.org/abs/1210.3845v1\nRelated links from Springer Link:\nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10115-012-0672-2#\nRelated links from IEEE:\nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6527772&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpl%2FarticleDetails.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6527772\n1.

    "Contrastive learning (CL) is a promising approach to unsupervised representation learning, which is recently extended to the medical imaging field. CL attempts to embed the input data without labels to a semantic space so that instances of the same class are closer and those from different classes are farther. However, there are two challenges that limit the performance of CL on medical images with limited annotations. (1) Limited annotations hinder the clustering of training images into large groups to learn global features for representation learning. (2) Different body organs have their unique image features, rendering the limited images from different organs unbalanced.\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose to use local features to learn global ones for better representation learning. Specifically, we cluster training images into small but balanced groups (i.e., clusters) and train a local CL (LCL) model for each cluster to learn its local features. During training, all the LCL models are combined into a global CL (GCL) model, which learns a global representation for input images by contrasting the representations from different clusters. To improve the segmentation performance, we explore a simple cross cluster contrastive learning framework which can adaptively learn the image representations between each cluster and all the other clusters during inference.\nIn addition, a simple but effective data augmentation technique is adopted to augment images for CL with limited annotations. The technique is based on morphological dilation and erosion operations that can generate the pseudo labels of augmented images. The proposed approach is evaluated on two popular medical image segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is competitive to the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning models on both tasks.\n\n\nIntroduction\nRecently, deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved tremendous successes for medical image segmentation [1,2,3,4,5]. However, most of which require a lot of densely-sampled annotations for model training. This is expensive to obtain and a major bottleneck of applying deep learning methods to medical imaging analysis. To address this issue, there is a growing body of methods to learn medical image representations unsupervisedly from large-scale medical data. Some of which learn from only a few annotations [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14].\nInspired by the contrastive learning (CL) framework",
    "In [11], we propose a new FCN architecture for LV segmentation. Figure 1 outlines the network's structure: 3D convolutions operate on the input volume and produce four feature maps from each input channel. To enable 3D convolutions and efficiently handle large 3D image volumes, we use downsampling (or \"strided convolutions\" in the terminology of [22]) to reduce the spatial dimensionality of the feature volume. Next, a U-net-like architecture is used to progressively recover the resolution of the image. After resolution recovery, a softmax function predicts the class probability of each voxel for the background and the myocardium. The loss function, shown in Equation (4), defines an entropy loss to help model sparsity of the ground-truth predictions during training.\n\n_Figure 5-1: FCN architecture for left ventricle segmentation in cardiac MR images._\n\nIn terms of dataset and parameters, we use the publicly available dataset _ACDC_ [2] from the 2016 MICCAI EndoVis challenge. The training set consists of 10 subjects, with an average of 28 volumes per subjects. 5 training images per subject are randomly selected as a testing set. We use 20 subjects from the validation set for testing. The remaining two subjects are used as a second testing set. To accelerate the training process, we train with a batch of 10 volumes per iteration and use an 8GB GPU.\n\nWe present the results in Figure 2. For subject-based evaluation, we use a 6mm isotropic Gaussian filter to smooth the ground-truth segmentation. The F1 score for subject-based evaluation is 81.9 +/−2.5%. In Figure 3, we show the qualitative results.\n\nThese results are not directly comparable to previous work due to the variation in data collection and different choice of metrics used for evaluating the models. It's the most common metric used by researchers using deep learning to segment MRI data (to the best of our knowledge, it's probably the most common metric used by scientists and researches in general).\n\nBy the way, what does the plus/minus range represent in the metric above? Let's look at the following explanation from the 2016 Endovis Challenge website, which was first to introduce the ACDC dataset and the metrics (also see [15]).",

    "\\begin{quote}\n  Recent progress in medical data science has relied on the availability of large annotated datasets. However, such datasets are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns and the labor required to annotate images manually, motivating research in self-supervised learning. One self-supervised learning strategy is data augmentation, in which different views of the same data are generated and treated as if they were different. One example of this is image contrastive learning, in which two slightly perturbed versions of an image are used to predict which one came first given their features. Despite the successes of contrastive learning, it cannot be applied in cases where raw data have not been collected or are not accessible. This motivates research in pseudo-data generation, in which a model learns to create synthetic images from random latent vectors, with those synthetic images acting as training data. A combination of both data augmentation and pseudo-data generation strategies has been shown to improve the robustness of the resulting model. While contrastive learning has been shown to work for natural images, there have been relatively few investigations of its performance on medical images. In this work, we present an end-to-end architecture for self-supervised training on medical image data from a private database that incorporates contrastive learning and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, we augment data by perturbing latent vectors associated with images, and use those to learn useful features before training a model for segmentation and detection. Experiments demonstrate the benefits of this approach, as the results of the proposed method beat the standard baseline, U-Net, as well as several other data-augmentation-only architectures on several segmentation and detection tasks.\n\\end{quote}\n\nThis abstract is an example of research in medical data science and the topic of self-supervised learning.

We use pre-training and self-training to improve performance.\n\n\\section{Experimental Setup}\n\\label{section:experimental_setup}\n\n\\subsection{Dataset}\nThe dataset that is used in this paper is a private dataset",
    "SwipeCut: Interactive Segmentation with Diversified Seed Proposals\nXiyang Wang, Vignesh Ramanathan, Xiaogang Wang, Anima Anandkumar, Alan L. Yuille (2022-02-24)\n\nAbstract:\nVideo object segmentation (VOS) aims at finding the boundary of moving objects of interest in videos. Although significant progress has been made on VOS via learning-based approaches, they only use a single proposal for object segmentation. This poses a challenge in segmenting objects with small or thin structures, such as wires and tubes in medical videos. To handle these challenges, we propose a novel approach for learning from interactive annotations. Specifically, we use a differentiable random-walk algorithm to generate multiple seed proposals for interactive segmentation. Additionally, we propose a novel interactive loss function, which takes into account both the user preference over multiple proposals as well as the preference of the user as the annotation progresses. Besides, we propose a model that has three main components: spatial features from an RGB backbone for capturing object appearance, temporal features for learning the trajectory of objects, and object-level features for encoding the appearance as well as the trajectory of each segment. A set of experiments on three different VOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods.

    "A novel context tree compression algorithm (CTC2) developed from CTC1 [1] is presented. As in CTC1, CTC2 employs a variable-length code table scheme for coding the leaves of the tree followed by a two-pass variable-length code table-based encoding algorithm of the non-leaf nodes. CTC2 is based on a new universal code structure with an extended set of rules that allow a universal coding structure with fewer code tables that reduces the peak memory requirement. Additionally, CTC2 uses the entropy model for binary source, which allows CTC2 to achieve a shorter code word size, and as a result provides more compact codes with improved compression efficiency. Finally, CTC2 addresses the computational complexity issue of CTC1 by introducing two new concepts, including the CTC2 encoding map and the CTC2 non-leaf node context tree encoding algorithm. The former is used for efficiently determining the node types (i.e., node depth, context tree and leaf table) and the latter for encoding the non-leaf nodes. The results show that CTC2 provides better compression rates with significantly lower peak memory and encoding (encoding map and context tree encoding) requirements compared to CTC1.",
    "Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results on many tasks and datasets. The standard practice for semantic segmentation, however, is still dominated by hand-crafted features and classifiers. Although recent research has explored deep models for semantic segmentation, their efficiency remains a bottleneck. Many solutions involve either overfitting, inefficient architectures, or post-processing. This paper presents a simple dense convolutional network, called DenseNet, for semantic segmentation, which addresses the aforementioned problems. Our model is built on top of a densely connected network. To increase the model capacity, a transition layer, consisting of a 1x1 convolution with a stride of 2x2, is added after each dense block. The number of features remains the same, enabling feature reuse. Moreover, dense blocks are densely connected not only within layers but also across them, enabling the reuse of features during the forward pass. To avoid feature degradation, each layer in the network uses skip connections to transmit features at all spatial resolutions to the following layers. Our architecture provides two main benefits for semantic segmentation: a reduction in parameter redundancy and a significant increase in model capacity. We evaluate our model and its variants on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. As our model is trained on the full resolution images of the PASCAL dataset, we also provide a model trained on ImageNet which has learned features useful for semantic segmentation and which performs comparably to models trained specifically on PASCAL.\n\nThe full text of the paper was published online by NVIDIA's corporate research unit in September 2016.

    "\"In the last decade of recent years, the effects of disorder in quantum and semi-classical systems have become one of the most important research areas in many-body physics. Disorder can lead to a variety of phenomena such as localization, phase transitions, and many-body localization. In the present work, the effects of randomness on the energy band structure and electronic properties of disordered materials are investigated with the help of a one-dimensional model. This model consists of chains of atoms connected by harmonic springs, and we study its behavior as a function of the random displacement of its constituent atoms. Disorder can cause the material to lose its translational invariance and results in the creation of so-called randomness-induced energy bands. Based on this, we calculated the dependence of the electronic transport properties on the strength of the disorder. We show that in the presence of disorder, the systems become Anderson-localized, meaning that their conductivity vanishes. We showed that the conductivity vanishes exponentially as a function of system sizes. We also discussed the effects of disorder on the band gap of the system and showed that there is a critical value of the disorder strength above which the system becomes an insulator.

In addition to being numerically stable (by design), we show that the DRN converges to the PDE solution as the number of hidden layers approaches infinity. Moreover, due to the infinite network width, the DRN is well-posed (in the sense that every minimizer is the global minimizer), unlike finite-width networks. We also consider several extensions to the DRN including adding data in the optimization problem, adding extra loss terms in the optimization problem (for instance, adding a penalty for non-locality), regularization methods such as batch normalization, and a numerical quadrature approach for discretizing the PDE.

    "Deep learning for ranking response surfaces with applications to optimal stopping problems\nC. Zhang 1,2 and A. G. Bartz 2 1Department of Mathematics, Colorado State University 2Department of Civil Engineering, Colorado State University The optimization problem with response surface modelling is investigated. Deep learning is embedded for parameter estimation and ranking response surfaces. The optimal stopping problem is first solved without considering the response surface, which is then integrated in ranking the response surfaces. Finally, a two-stage optimization problem is solved to consider simultaneously multi-dimensional response surfaces. The proposed method is then used for solving the optimal design of pavement rehabilitation by minimizing the pavement maintenance costs.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nOptimization problems (OPs) have been extensively investigated in many areas. OP problem is to find the optimum for some problem, which can be mathematically formulated as: where f min is the optimal value, x is the decision variable, and x ∈ X ⊂ R d. In OPs, the objective function f (x) is known. The decision maker only knows the value of objective function through a set of m observations (x i, f i ), i = 1, 2, · · ·, m. In general, the search space is limited because of cost of collecting data.\nOne approach to address above-mentioned problem is to rank potential points by the evaluation of their predictive values with data-driven models rather than using actual evaluations. A response surface (RS) is a technique, particularly useful when computing objective function value is expensive. RS models f (x) by fitting a function to data (x, f (x)) [1]. It is used here to rank candidate solutions. Given the model, the global optimum can be computed.\nThere are several approaches proposed to solve the optimal stopping problem (OSP) [2,3,4,5]: 1. The response surface of a candidate solution x is given.\nThen optimal stopping boundary is computed. An approximation of optimal value of OSP is then obtained by evaluating the optimal stopping boundary associated with each candidate solution.\n2. Optimal stopping boundaries for each candidate solution are given. Then optimal value of OSP is computed by evaluating optimal stopping boundaries for each candidate solution.\nThe OSP has been extensively investigated during the last few decades [2,3,4,",
    "Highly accurate pixel-aligned image super-resolution (SR) is desired in many practical applications and is extremely challenging since it essentially requires estimating the high spatial frequency components. The underlying reason is that SR aims at recovering a high resolution (HR) image from a low-pass (LP) representation of it. The missing frequency information is the key source that makes the LR image look blurred and the HR image blurry. Intuitively there is a tradeoff between the image sharpness and its blur. In the literature the sharpness is quantified by various regularizers which measure differences between adjacent pixels. However, it is not yet clear how to quantitatively and accurately quantify the image blur or how to relate it to the desired image sharpness. To bridge this gap we construct a blur quantifier based on the LP model of the image and develop a theoretical framework to study the relationships between the blur metric, the proposed image sharpness and other regularizers. We also apply the proposed method in the context of deep learning to train a deep SR network. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods.\n\nThis abstract from a paper discussing how to increase the resolution of images uses a complex metaphor to help explain an equally complex technical concept.\n\nFrom your earlier analysis and synthesis of the text, what are you able to determine about how this will help?\n\n# **6.4 METADATA**\n\nThe metadata is what goes on behind the scenes.

Experimental results show that this method can detect small shifts or incorrect contour insertions or deletions. The evaluation based on the proposed technique was performed using two categories of contours: the average contours from 3D-CT or MRI images based on expert and trainee delineations and contours generated by a fully automated segmentation algorithm. We demonstrate that a low percentage of uncertainty is present in the consensus contours, representing a low percentage of disagreement between the experts' and trainees' contour delineations.

    "> **Abstract:**\n> **Domain adaptation** and **label unification** (DLU) are two promising directions that play an important role in alleviating overfitting to datasets with only a subset of true labels. The performance of supervised domain adaptation is significantly suboptimal when test-time labels in a target domain are in disagreement with the labels from training data. The main problem of DLU is the high-dimensional manifold that labels from multiple datasets are located on. Most recent DLU approaches are based on the assumption that the manifold of labels is linear. In this work, we propose a framework that enables both DLU and domain adaptation with only a partial dataset from the target domain. We propose to learn a data-driven label unification model that captures the non-linear relationships between labels from multiple domains. We show that our method enables to find novel features and corresponding labels that are helpful to improve the performance of DLU and supervised domain adaptation. Our experimental results on standard benchmark datasets including Office-Home, VLCS, and VisDA validates our proposed framework.\n>\n> <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07672>",

    "Polarization Modes in a Multi-Moded Concentrator\nA Multi-Moded Concentrator (MMC) is constructed from a plurality of reflective and/or diffractive elements so as to focus the power density of an otherwise dispersed solar radiation source into a plurality of focal lines. An MMC utilizes one or more polarization separation plates that are oriented in a specific manner so that all lines of focused energy in the far-field (or output focal plane) of the MMC are orthogonal to each other and to the polarization separation plate. Each line of far-field energy is then coupled into a respective energy conversion apparatus such as a solar cell. An MMC comprises a novel arrangement of reflective elements and one or more polarization separation plates that separate the incoming light into orthogonal planes at the near-field of the MMC so that all lines of focused light are orthogonal to each other at the focal plane so that each line can be captured into a respective energy conversion apparatus such as a solar cell. The MMC has application to solar power generation and/or other energy capture technologies. This paper presents an initial analysis of the polarization properties of the MMC based on ray optics.\n\n(ii) (b)\nRay optics is used as an initial model to investigate the polarization properties of an MMC. We assume for the purpose of this study that each line of energy that emerges from the concentrator is a ray propagating orthogonally to the normal of the concentrator. We are assuming that the MMC is made with a refractive material of index ı and is oriented so that the z-axis is normal to the concentrator's focal plane, y is along the length of the MMC, and x is orthogonal to the focal plane.

    "A generalization of the Plancherel formula for the orthogonal representation is considered, which has determinantal form in $m \\times m$ and $n \\times n$ submatrices of a nonnegative integer matrix $A$ of size $n \\times m$. It turns out that this is a particular case of the Plancherel formula for the representation $\\tau_j$ of the Clifford algebra associated with the binary quadratic form of size $n \\times m$. The representation $\\tau_j$ is determined by a nonnegative integer matrix $V$ by the rule $V_{pq}$ being the absolute value of the $q$-th coordinate of the position of $p$ in the $\\tau_j$-space. As it was shown in the previous papers, there is a correspondence between the representations of the Clifford algebra and the representations of the Lie algebra $A_{n-1}$. Using this correspondence in the case when the representation $\\tau_j$ is unitary, it is shown that the Plancherel formula for the representation of the Clifford algebra takes place in $\\tau_j$-space as it was previously known for representations of Lie algebra.\n\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn this paper, we consider a generalization of the Plancherel formula on an orthogonal representation. In particular, the case when such a representation is associated with the binary matrix A which is positive in the sense that each of its submatrices of size n × n and m × m is positive definite is investigated. It is shown that such a representation is related to the representation ρ j of the Clifford algebra. It is shown that in this case, the Plancherel formula for the representation of the Clifford algebra is a particular case of the Plancherel formula on an orthogonal representation. It is shown that for such representation ρ j, the determinantal form of the Plancherel-Pólya theorem is true.\nThe determinantal representation is used in many areas, such as physics, computer vision, coding theory, quantum chemistry, etc. In particular, the determinantal expressions form the bases of the quantum statistical mechanics theory, the orthogonal polynomials theory, the theory of difference schemes, the theory of the orthogonal series of the classical groups [1,2].\nTherefore, in many respects, one can say that these determinantal representations can not be overestimated.

    "In this paper, we introduce a generalizable few-shot learning framework for medical image segmentation [1]. Our framework contains two main components: a base model and a calibration model. For the base model, we utilize a pre-trained general vision transformer (ViT1-B-16) fine-tuned through image classification and segmentation tasks in the target domain (i.e. medical imaging). For the calibration model, we perform a few-shot calibration with one, two or five labelled cases, which makes our method compatible with various labeling efforts. We further propose a re-scaling algorithm for the calibration model that can boost the performance by taking different image scales into consideration. We evaluate our model on four different medical segmentation tasks, achieving the best performance among the compared methods.\nThis model is not yet available on the Hugging Face Transformers Hub.

    "The increasing availability of densely annotated crowd images has motivated research on automatic image segmentation of tightly packed human crowds, a task that is both relevant for visual surveillance and computer graphics. In this paper, we advance the state of the art in crowd segmentation with a new fully convolutional model. Unlike previous image segmentation methods that use iterative optimization and explicit feature extraction and pooling in image space, our model is end-to-end, spatially equivariant, and differentiable. Specifically, we replace explicit pooling with upsampling and introduce several novel losses that account for the inherent structural nature of the crowd segmentation problem. Our novel loss functions enable a direct optimization of the boundary pixels, which are critical for accurate segmentation. Our approach addresses important limitations of existing approaches (i.e., lack of discriminative boundary information, inability to learn an appropriate global shape model), which we empirically validate on two datasets of densely annotated images. Importantly for real-time processing, our model is parallelizable and runs in real-time on a standard CPU.\nFully Convolutional Neural Networks for Crowd Segmentation https://t.co/7y6a6f3Puf pic.twitter.com/b4f3Mw0LmR\n— arxiv highlights (@arxiv_daily) July 9, 2017\nTo better understand the workings of the fully convolutional neural networks of the above research paper, see the following video:\nThe following are highlights from the research paper, per the author of the tweet:\n\"To summarize, our model addresses four key limitations of existing approaches.

    "This paper describes a system that employs an autoencoder to measure the thickness of a human head overcoat automatically. The training and testing of the system were conducted using data from a real-world head overcoat dataset. The data for each record included the thickness of a human head overcoat and the image of that head. The system was used to measure the thickness of a real-world head overcoat. The results showed that the proposed system could accurately measure the thickness of a real-world head overcoat under varying illumination conditions. The system could also accurately measure the thickness of a real-world head overcoat under varying head positions and body positions. This paper proposes a system that uses an autoencoder to measure the thickness of a human head overcoat automatically. The system is based on the assumption that a head overcoat is a three-layer object composed of the head, the top layer, and the bottom layer. The system consists of three parts: the front-end portion, which is responsible for image pre-processing; the autoencoder, which is responsible for determining the thickness of the head overcoat; and the back-end portion, which is responsible for post-processing the raw data and then outputting to the user. The front-end portion first generates features from the input image using a Convolution that extracts features from the image.\nThis paper discusses a network used to automatically measure the thickness of head overcoat. The paper starts by talking about why an automatic head overcoat thickness measure is important. The paper goes on to discuss the network's architecture, including its encoder and decoder components, before going into detail about the algorithm used by the network to measure the thickness of head overcoat. The paper concludes by talking about how the network can be used to measure the thickness of head overcoat in practice.\n\n1.2Introduction\nHead overcoat thickness is an important indicator of the quality of head overcoat. An overcoat is a long garment that reaches down to the ankles and may be worn over other clothes. Thicker overcoat provides better protection than one that is thinner. Overcoats are often worn when people are working outdoors, such as in wintertime. However, overcoats may also be worn for formal occasions, such as weddings or funerals.\nHead coats are traditionally made of two layers, a top layer",
    "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used to treat movement disorders. The placement of electrodes in the brain is guided during surgery using imaging using real-time MRI. However, manual localization of the implanted DBS electrodes has to be performed post-operatively. To achieve automatic localization, a patient specific atlas can be registered to an MRI scan with the electrodes and a segmentation algorithm can be applied to detect the electrodes. Localization of DBS electrodes is a challenging task due to the following reasons: first, electrode arrays are thin metallic structures on soft tissue, second the implanted electrodes can be out of the scan field in some of the images and third, the metallic electrodes have very low signal strength making segmentation challenging. We hypothesize, that due to the thin structure of the DBS electrode array and small metal contact pads on the tips of the electrodes, the trajectory of the electrode tips can be modelled as a chain-like structure and can be segmented from the MRI scan through a novel trajectory-based segmentation approach. The proposed method provides an advantage over conventional segmentation methods as the trajectory information is not lost in any of the individual slices. The experimental results show the superiority of our method over other state of the art methods for the segmentation of DBS electrode arrays.",

    "\"We address the problem of label imbalanced multi-nuclei segmentation by proposing Generative Synthetic Augmentation using Labelto-Image Translation (GenSynAug). To improve data-efficiency in multi-nuclei segmentation, we introduce a generative model as the synthetic augmentation policy. Specifically, we train a label-to-image translator using unpaired synthetic labels and synthetic images, respectively. Additionally, the proposed generative model allows us to have an additional degree-of-freedom during the labeling process, where the user has full control on how much synthetic data they want to augment their dataset with. We have demonstrated that our method is compatible to different medical deep segmentation models and that our approach is very effective in boosting the performance with high amounts of synthetic data. We have also carried out ablation studies of our method, to show that increasing the amount of data is not optimal, instead it is better to have consistent augmentation with small amount of synthetic data.

The Hall resistivity, for T<150 K, is a direct function of H2 and independent of temperature. The inverse (H/T)2 scaling of Hall resistivity is seen even upto very low temperatures indicating the dominance of skew scattering in Ge(1-x-y)Pb(x)Mn(y)Te. The carrier mobility at 150 K, extracted from Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) oscillations, drops to zero at ~ 6% Mn concentration indicating that the low mobility carriers are Mn atoms.

    "\"Computer Aided Detection (CADe) systems are essential tools used by radiologists to assist their diagnosis and decision-making procedures. The rapid increase of CADe systems is attributed to the advances of CNNs in medical-image analysis. For optimal performance, the networks used in CADe require data that is labelled by a radiologist, which can be labor-intensive. We propose nnDetection, an algorithm that predicts objects-to-label, that is, selects informative object proposals from images (Figure 1). nnDetection is a self-configuring method that uses a weakly-supervised network (WiSe). It is composed of two phases. The first phase, the learning phase, allows the network to predict plausible classes from a set of labels. The classes are then organized using hierarchical clustering in the second phase. To evaluate our system, we used 747 cases, split as training and testing. Our results show that nnDetection performs on par with a fully-supervised network, with a precision = 0.95 and AUC = 0.99 (Figure 1).

    "\"With the advance of medical imaging technologies and their increasing importance in today's health care, the need for precise and fast segmentation algorithms for biomedical images (BI) has never been higher. One of the most challenging tasks in biomedical image analysis is to precisely delineate and segment organs and lesions from imaging data (e.g., MRI, CT, PET, etc.) while removing any unnecessary background. With increasing complexity of modern medical imaging modalities, manual delineation is no longer feasible, especially for large databases, which is why automatic and robust segmentation algorithms are being developed. One of the most useful strategies is to use atlases of expert-labeled images to help segment new images automatically. Since the 1990s, many approaches have been proposed for registering and fusing label information from multiple atlases. These approaches can be broadly classified into two categories: region-based and pixel-based, according to the information level on which they operate.\n\nRegion-based approaches segment images by assigning them to regions from multiple atlases. In particular, they usually represent each region by a code and fuse multiple atlases through clustering strategies to generate the final segmentation. A common drawback of region-based methods is that the label information of individual pixels cannot be used, and they are prone to errors, in particular, in the presence of noisy or unregistered atlases.\n\nPixel-based fusion methods rely on the pixel-level information to perform segmentation of images. The segmentation is accomplished by assigning each voxel to one of the labels of one of the atlases. Pixel-based methods can use all the available label information at the correct location and require accurate segmentation of each image. Consequently, they are more accurate than region-based fusion methods.\n\nIn this paper, we provide an in-depth survey of all the existing techniques, which either perform region- or pixel-based segmentation of images. In particular, we discuss region-based and pixel-based algorithms that have shown promising results for BI segmentation in literature. Furthermore, we present a summary and analyze the current state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms and provide recommendations on how to choose the right segmentation strategy for BI applications.\n\nWith the advance of modern medical imaging technologies and their increasing importance in the medical field, the need for fast and accurate segmentation methods has never been higher.

    "(link to full paper)\nWe propose a novel segmentation technique based on active contour model and topological alignment based on three assumptions, (i) The image background and object are represented as two manifolds, (ii) the image gradients are locally continuous across the common edges; and (iii) two manifolds are aligned only across their common edges. We also propose topological alignment techniques, the main novelty of which lies in the fact that it does not assume that the two manifolds are parallel to each other.\nThe paper is not exactly a new proposal of this method, since the author refers to this paper for a brief description of Active Contour Method (ACM): (link to full paper)\nOur algorithm is based on active contour model (ACM). The goal of ACM is to search for the optimal contour of some desired shape. The curve or surface that best satisfies this requirement is a minimizer of the energy function and is usually called the active contour. The work of Kass, Witkin and Terzopoulos [14] provides a complete review of ACM.\nIt's quite a long paper, but you can always come back to it later; all the information I needed for this answer is within the abstract.",
    "In this paper we tackle the crowd sourcing image segmentation problem, i.e., segmentation of an image from crowd labeled example images. The input is a set of images provided by the crowd and corresponding image segments. The output is a fully labeled image. The image segmentation problem is formulated as a multiclass pixel-wise semantic labeling problem. We solve it with a framework, called iaSTAPLE, where the labeling uncertainty is modeled via an active learning framework. More precisely, in order to generate and label candidate segments in the most informative way for segment discovery, we propose a strategy that is based on minimizing predictive entropy. Experiments on three real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our method by showing significant performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art crowd sourcing system.\n\nThe next article shows a use of the \"Crowd Flower\" tool, called \"Image Classification with Crowd Flower\", which can be used to develop image classification applications or \"crowdsourcers\" by \"uploading images, building your workflow, adding some sample image annotations, creating groups of workers for your tasks, providing feedback to workers (e.g. on image quality) and starting image classification tasks\".\n\nOne of the following research proposals show that a crowdsourcing task is not only used to solve a \"hard problem\", but can also be used for crowd recruitment, training and testing purposes, which are very important:\n\nSome of the following research proposals show that a crowdsourcing task is not only used to solve a \"hard problem\", but can also be used to recruit crowd workers, train and test crowd workers for other tasks, which is also very important:\n\nThe following research proposal is also interesting because it compares the performance of human and machine systems in the image segmentation problem:\n\nA few of these research papers show various ways to \"enhance performance and reliability for crowd sourced image classification datasets \" and that can also possibly be extended to image segmentation tasks:\n\"One key issue is that crowd workers typically have little or no formal training in their particular tasks, so they generally lack knowledge of the concepts and semantics associated with the task. \nHence, the task becomes purely a cognitive activity of simply choosing what looks \"best\" to the worker.

    "<div align=\"justify\"> \n<b>\nAbstract \n</b> \nThis paper describes GeoSim, a system to automatically render realistic video clips of a static environment from a single aerial view using scene and motion reconstruction. Unlike existing methods, GeoSim requires only a single view of the scene and does not require any information on the scene layout or object models. Given a camera pose, our approach can accurately compute the 3D locations for all objects in the scene and reconstruct the 3D scene layout. Using the extracted layout, we then synthesize a video using our novel geometry-aware video simulation. Finally, we use a novel compositing method to generate realistic video clips. We show that our method can generate high-quality videos when only one view of a scene is available. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoSim on both real and synthetic data, achieving results that are comparable to state-of-the-art.\n</div>",
    "In a very long and interesting answer I have already given an overview of the results and their interpretation. Some of them have been presented already in two conference contributions I had published and I am preparing an upcoming publication. Here, I want to present a more in depth discussion. In my view the results of the paper are pretty amazing, because even though dry granular media is known not to behave as an ordinary fluid the data obtained agrees perfectly with the predictions of ordinary Hydrodynamic Theory, as you mentioned in your original question. But for a more detailed discussion let's start from the introduction. Here, the first three paragraphs should give a good overview over the general properties of an ordinary suspension:\nIn a fluidised bed an air flow is blown through the material and particles move, even if only slightly, across the bed. Such fluids, where the constituents still flow individually, are different from liquids, where hydrodynamic interactions between particles are important. At a critical Reynolds number the fluidised bed flows similar to a liquid. In both cases a continuum description of the fluid is valid, in other words, the macroscopic behaviour of a fluid can be described by a single tensor field. More generally, the continuum assumption is valid if the fluid’s mean free path is small compared to the largest scale of spatial variation of the flow (e.g. a length scale with a small mean free path will behave like an ordinary solid; a large mean free path will behave like a gas) (Landau & Lifshitz, 1986).\nThe classical example of a suspension is water with salt and other solids present. If the solid density is considerably larger that that of the fluid, we are dealing with a “dense suspension” whereas in cases with equal masses of liquid and solid part, a “dilute suspension” occurs. For a suspension of particles in a simple fluid the viscosity is given by\n\\begin{equation} \\mu( I)=  \\mu_0 +\\eta \\, I(s) - \\xi(I) - \\mu_{sl} \\, I(s).\\end{equation} This is known as the Jeffery equation, where $\\mu_0$ is the viscosity of the simple fluid, $I(s)=s/(\\phi/(1-\\phi))$ the dimensionless inter-particle distance and $\\phi$ the volume fraction of the",
    "Study on the Differences between High\n  Contrast Grating Reflectors on the Performance of Vertical-Cavity Surface\n  Emitting Lasers (VCSELs)\n\n\nThe present work investigates the effects of a simple one-side high-contrast\n  grating, with a periodic structure\n  characterized by a single grating period for TE- polarized and TM- polarized\n  light, together with the impact of these differences on the performance of\n  numerous commercially available Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL)\n  systems.

The impact of this grating\n  orientation on the output wavelength, output power, threshold current and the\n  power efficiency of the VCSEL is discussed. \nIt is concluded that,  the grating for TE- light has a bigger impact on the\n  performance characteristics of the VCSEL system. \n\n \n\n\nA: \"Polarization\" is what happens when waves interfere.  As Wikipedia tells us:\n\nIn physics and optics, polarization is a property of a wave that is\n  perpendicular to the direction of energy and momentum propagation. \n\nThey quote an older definition which I think makes it clearer:\n\nLight rays with their planes of oscillation perpendicular to the line of\n  propagation are called vertically polarized; so also are light rays with\n  their planes of vibration perpendicular to the line of propagation.\n\nSo a polarized light ray consists of two parallel waves oscillating in perpendicular planes.  That doesn't mean they are necessarily moving perpendicular to the light rays' path and each other, however; it means they are oscillating perpendicular to the light rays' path and each other.\n\nA: The term polarization can seem very confusing.  There's the usual\nsense in which we talk about polarized sunglasses cutting down on glare.\nThese sunglasses are usually made with polarization filters that allow\npictures of the world to reach your eyes without glare (from light\nreflected from surfaces at 90 degrees to your line of sight).

    "Current methods of extraction text in a document image either do not work for high-entropy (H-EI) degraded images or may need an enormous amount of training data to achieve the same accuracy. A recent study has suggested a multi-spectral (MS) approach using various image processing algorithms to extract text. This MS approach requires a complex pre-processing methodology to be performed on the document image. We have proposed a different methodology to address this issue by proposing a Bagging based Deep CNN Model (BDCM) to extract text from H-EI images. To test our model, we used a document image with high entropy degraded in different ways. The main contributions of this research are as follows: (1) the proposed BDCM extracts text from original and H-EI document images with high accuracy; (2) for comparison, we have used several other traditional and non-Bagging based deep neural network models such as KNN, RBM, CNN, and DDM; (3) the results are verified by F-measure, precision and recall; and (4) we have used H-EI document images in different domains such as printed English letters, printed Bangla letters, Indo-Arabic text and Chinese text in addition to some other pre-processed images such as Gaussian blurred, Speckled, etc. The results show that BDCM extracts text accurately for H-EI document images in all the above domains.\nFor anyone who wishes to view the complete study, the abstract may be viewed here.",
    "Consider an inequality of a certain type involving a function of two variables (for example, f(x, y) ≤ k). Does this inequality hold or not? We present an efficient algorithm that answers the question as follows: given ε > 0, find an (x, y) with f(x, y) > k/ε or prove that no such (x, y) exists. Our algorithm runs in time exp(-Ω(k)) (with f specified by an Oracie that returns f(x, y) on any query). In particular, by iterating (ε ← 1/poly(k)), we are guaranteed to either find a counterexample (x, y) satisfying f(x, y) > k by ε/poly(k) or, after a polynomial number of iterations, get an answer with poly(k) bits of precision. This algorithm is of independent interest. We apply it in the following way. Many mathematical questions about large integer polynomials can be reduced to testing functional inequalities. Our new bound immediately implies new results in the polynomial method for integer polynomials.\n\nThe paper is written in such a way that I cannot tell whether it is related to cryptography or not, and what is this \"polynomial method\" anyway?\nCan someone explain the results and their consequences?  \n\nA: The polynomial method is one of the oldest techniques in algebraic number theory, introduced by Jacoby in the 19th century and developed by Cassels in the 20th century.  It is usually applied to problems about elliptic curves.  The basic idea is to decompose polynomials into products of polynomials of lower degree by looking at their roots.\nIn a nutshell: given an integer polynomial p(x) (where x is a finite extension of the rationals, such as the integers modulo some prime) you try to factor it.  But it is much easier to factor a degree $n$ polynomial if each of the roots of $p(x)$ is actually of order $O(n^\\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$ rather than of order $O(\\sqrt n)$.

    "\"Background: Fingerprint image segmentation, a key step in any fingerprint-based biometric system, has been a key and challenging problem in the field. To this end, researchers have proposed many techniques for fingerprint image segmentation. The choice of segmentation method plays a vital role in the performance of fingerprint systems. Some of these methods are dependent on the characteristics of the fingerprint image while some methods are not.\nProblems: In a scenario involving a huge amount of data, it will be a difficult and time-consuming task to select a particular fingerprint segmentation method after manually analysing the characteristics of fingerprint images. Some image segmentation methods can fail to give a good result even when the image has the characteristics mentioned in a research article, and the user should try every other method for a good result.\nMethods: Our main objective is to design a filter or a technique which can automatically detect the fingerprint image segmentation method which will give best result. Our proposed method is a generalized solution which can be used to select a best method for any type of fingerprint image. This method makes use of a few characteristics of fingerprint and image which can be calculated with minimal processing time.\nResults: In order to demonstrate the efficiency, a few experiments are conducted on real fingerprint images and a single method is identified for every image using the proposed method. Further, the proposed method is compared with the existing techniques. Based on experimental results, the proposed method yields better results in terms of processing time, segmentation quality and overall performance.\nConclusions: The main objective is to select the best image segmentation method without analysing a fingerprint image. The experiments show that the proposed method can do this job and the performance is comparable or better than the existing approaches.

    "We present a statistical analysis of secondary ion yield distributions using Monte Carlo simulations for a dual incident ion beam (DIB) of Kr/Ar, Xe/Ne and Xe/Kr. These distributions were modelled as a result of the interplay of the sputtering and fragmentation processes induced by a DIB, in combination with a simple kinetic model. To simulate the complex ion source characteristics of a DIB with respect to the flux ratio of the two component ions, we have used a Monte Carlo method to generate a two-component ion beam with a predefined flux ratio for each ion. To investigate the effect of rotation between the two ion beams on the secondary ion yield distributions we use a simple Monte Carlo model. We study the effects of the rotation angle and the primary ion beam incident angle on the secondary ion yield distributions.\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12252.pdf\nThat paper includes the following conclusions:\nOur results show that by increasing or decreasing the rotation angle and the primary ion beam angle, the mean secondary ion yield increases or decreases.\nWhen the rotation angle is zero, the secondary ion yield shows a peak for a certain incident angle of the primary ion. However, with increasing rotation angle the secondary ion yield distribution becomes a continuous curve.\nAt high angles of incidence, the secondary ion yield distribution is almost uniform.\nThe average yield at high angles of incidence is reduced significantly.\nWith increasing rotation angle the mean value of the secondary ion yield distribution continuously decreases.\nFor higher values of the rotation angle the flux of the target atoms decreases and the average yield reduces.\nThe mean secondary ion yield distribution does not show any distinct peak for the rotation angle of 30-60 degrees.\n« Reply #11 on: 06/09/2018 20:48:30 »\nI agree with your conclusion. The fact that these sputtering rates were observed is not unusual. These rates are also much higher than what most sputter yields tables and references list. These tables are compiled from a range of experiments and the authors typically try to identify what the dominant sputtering process is in different regimes. That is the process that results in the sputter rate decreasing more slowly with increasing energy. This can change because of substrate chemistry, impurities, residual gases, and the nature of the target.\nhttps://pubs.acs",
    "It is very hard to find medical cases with good-quality annotated image scans. However, researchers often have access to one good scan and many scans with poor quality. In the medical imaging literature, it is a common practice to train models only on the good scan and evaluate them on multiple scans. This practice is known as extreme data augmentation (XDA). In this paper, we present a new method (called SegXDA) that is based on self training and generates additional good-quality instances. These instances are generated by selecting poor quality images with similar characteristics to the good image. We use a deep learning model along with the segmentation output to measure similarities between images. Based on this measure, we select and mask out regions of interest in the image from the same class and use it as a pseudo label for the poor quality image. This self-training approach enables us to learn from all images.\nOur experiments show that this method improves the performance of the segmentation task when compared to training only on the good-quality scan. To demonstrate the usefulness of SegXDA, we selected a brain tumor segmentation task in low grade glioma MRI (multi-modality) scans and a heart region segmentation task in 3D ECG MRI scans. This method improved the segmentation quality by up to 15% and achieved 5% higher accuracy for the brain tumor dataset and 1% for the heart region dataset.\nWe have released the code under the \"MIT\" license. The source code, data, and instructions for usage are available on our project's GitHub repository, https://github.com/AmeyaParate/SegXDA-Segmentation.\nHow can medical imaging be used?\nMedical imaging refers to the process of creating medical images of human organs and other structures using specialized scanning devices, like MRIs or X-Rays. Medical imaging techniques can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of various conditions, as well as in the development of effective therapies.\nThere are several benefits associated with medical imaging. One benefit is that it can help to diagnose conditions that may not otherwise be detected. For instance, X-Rays and MRIs can be used to detect abnormalities in bones, ligaments and soft tissues. This can be particularly helpful in cases where an injury or other problem is not apparent on the surface. Additionally, MR",
    "\"Motivation: Medical image segmentation is a very important component in the health system, which plays a role in diagnosis and medical decision making. Manual segmentation of medical images is labor-intensive and time-consuming, and traditional automated segmentation methods based on a single task usually cannot adapt to image characteristics, leading to low performance. In this paper, we proposed to tackle this problem with a novel multi-task deep segmentation network (called PSI-Net), which is dedicated to simultaneously estimating shape and boundary-aware pixel-level segmentation in medical images.\n\nMethod: Psi-Net integrates multiple tasks and modules (boundary and shape estimation) to train a deep neural network, which has two advantages. First, we propose an automatic label generation method that generates ground truth labels for multiple tasks with one-click, which enhances the training efficiency and helps solve practical problems. In addition, multiple deep networks trained by the multiple tasks are integrated into a single network, which can effectively utilize the shared information among multiple tasks, thereby reducing memory and computational costs. We experimentally evaluated our proposed method on a set of public datasets, including MoNuSeg, MICCAI15, MICCAI17, and compared it with other state-of-the-art segmentation methods in medical images.\n\nDiscussion: The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model has achieved state-of-the-art results in most cases, outperforming single task deep learning methods and achieving promising results when compared with methods that also integrate multiple tasks. Compared with other multi-task networks, our PSINet has the following specific advantages. First, multiple losses with different weights are used to automatically adjust the importance of each task during training. Second, the architecture of the PSI-Net automatically adjusts the boundary of segmentation to make the segmentation more smooth and beautiful.\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrt}  \n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\\input{sections/1_intro.tex}\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\label{sec:rel}\n\\input{sections/2_re_work.tex}\n\n\\section{Multi-Task Network for Multi-Modality Fusion}\n\\label{sec:mtn}\n\\input{sections/3",

Freehand sketches of buildings, vehicles, animals etc. are commonly used to denote their structure or to specify their design aspects. We propose the problem of parsing such sketches into semantic parts (e.g. rooms, seats, wheels, legs etc.). Since freehand sketches do not contain any explicit structure or semantics, we introduce a novel semantic segmentation network on top of the U-Net architecture that captures global contextual information to perform per pixel classification. We propose a novel loss function that combines categorical and pixel-level cross-entropy losses to train two-staged SFSegNet models. We evaluate our method on different datasets of architectural floorplans, animal shapes, and urban structures. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art segmentation networks that are trained with only categorical cross-entropy loss cannot accurately segment these images. This is because these approaches focus predominantly on accurately classifying the parts into semantic classes. In contrast, our proposed model is also capable of accurately classifying the pixels into semantically meaningful classes while also assigning a semantic class to each pixel. The per pixel classification output helps achieve improved accuracy and better localization. By comparing results of different models, we show that with the proposed loss function, semantic segmentation results of SFSegNet are better than other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, adding more complexity to the network did not give better results. The proposed loss function with SFSegNet-3 outperforms other complex models such as PSPNN and DenseNet by a significant margin. Moreover, SFSegNet-3 runs at 20.3 fps on a Titan X GPU and achieves an accuracy of 0.83. On average, our method improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods by 3.5%.",
    "As indicated by Planck (Ade et al. 2016), ΛCDM is the concordance cosmological model. It is based on the Einsteinian general relativity, on the inflationary paradigm and on the hot Big Bang model, whose best fit to a standard set of cosmological data is provided by a six-parameter extension of the Einstein-de Sitter model, for which the free parameters are (i) the baryon density, Ω_b h^2, (ii) the CDM density, Ω_c h^2, (iii) the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance, θ, (iv) the optical depth, τ, (v) the reionization optical depth, τ_R, (vi) the scalar spectral index, n_s. It is interesting to ask how much the determination of the abundances of the light chemical elements would contribute in further constraining the ΛCDM model, especially in the context of some still existing controversy around the primordial helium abundance, Y_p, the estimate of which is important for the physics of BBN (Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis). Indeed, the values currently suggested by various groups differ at the 3 sigma level (Coc et al. 2016).\nThe situation is especially interesting in the context of the fact that the Planck CMB data suggest a surprisingly low value of Y_p (see Coc et al. 2016 for a recent review), an issue that has been long recognized as the main unsolved problem of the ΛCDM model concerning BBN predictions. On the contrary, the BBN model in its standard formulation requires that the primordial helium mass fraction be Y_p = 0.243 ± 9% at 1 sigma. The low value suggested by the Planck data comes out by combining the Planck CMB data with two other high-precision data sets, namely the BAO Hubble parameter measurements by Planck (Hinshaw et al. 2016) and the WMAP polarization data (Dunkley et al. 2009). The low value of Y_p is in a broad agreement with the most recent results from the observations of the high redshift (z >= 3) quasar absorption spectra (Izotov et al. 2016).\nHere we present our new results on the primordial helium abundance Y_",
    "A common approximation for the alignment and orientation of molecules is to assume a uniform electric field across the entire molecule.  For this approximation to be valid the molecular electric multipole expansion should converge rapidly to zero.  In this paper we study the topology of surfaces in space and the properties of their limits and asymptotic behavior through which molecules attain equilibrium in Stark energy, alignment and orientation.  We show that convergence properties are linked to the topology of the space, hence the behavior of the electric multipole expansion, so that for a given topology there is a range of field strength for which Stark state convergence will hold.\n\nThe research paper includes a proof that the electric multipole expansion converges when $q\\rightarrow\\infty$, for $q$ the electrostatic field.\n\nLet us consider a molecule in an electric field $\\vec E$.\nThe total energy of the molecule can be written as\n$$E(\\vec E) = - \\frac{\\vec d \\cdot \\vec E}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}+ {1\\over 2} e_\\parallel(\\vec E)^2+ {\\cal O}(q^{-6}),$$\nwhere $\\vec d$ is the dipole moment of the molecule, $e_\\parallel$ is the parallel component of the electric field, and\n$q = (4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^{-1/2} |\\vec d||\\vec E|$\nis the ratio between the electric field strength and the dipole moment.\nFor the approximation to hold, the coefficient\nof the second term\n$e_\\parallel(\\vec E)^2$ must converge to zero.\nThis is guaranteed when the multipole expansion vanishes at infinity, a stronger condition because it also implies that\n$e_\\parallel(\\vec E)^2$ is bounded.\nSince multipole expansion is not unique, we shall instead restrict our attention to a class $\\Omega$ of spaces and electric potentials.\nLet $d \\in \\Omega$ be dipole moment and\n$\\vec E \\in\\Omega$ be electric field.\nThere is a unique surface ${\\cal T}(q, \\vec d, \\vec E)$ such that\n$E(\\vec E) = - \\frac{\\vec d \\cdot \\vec E}{4\\pi\\",
    "> Deep learning systems currently focus on a single network level to solve segmentation tasks. However, this approach can result in overfitting, leading to poor generalization to other levels and classes. A multi-level activation scheme could potentially address this problem. Here, we propose a method where feature activations at multiple levels of the network can be combined to predict the label of a given example. Our method predicts the label by iteratively assigning each example to its most similar class in a hierarchical sequence of classes. Our proposed method also avoids the issues of a two-level method where features are activated only at the lower and upper bounds of an activation spectrum, and therefore ignores the feature activations at intermediate values. We demonstrate experimental benefits of our model on datasets from different domains, and compare our results in terms of network complexity, accuracy, and convergence time.\n\nWhile this paper focused on classification, our method can be extended to segmentation by using the multi-label version of the method.\n\n### References:\n\n[1] N.

    "Domination parameters with value 2 have been studied since the 1960s, when it has been proved that every such parameter is hereditary. In a seminal paper, Todorcevic conjectured that in fact every such parameter is induced. Until now, not much has been known about parameters with value 2 except for the following result - Todorcevic's conjecture is true if and only if any two hereditary parameters are equivalent under some algebraic operations. In this paper we prove the following structural results: firstly, a parameter is inherited by all its subuniversals modulo some algebraic operations if and only if some of its parameter values equal 1 (i.e. are inherited by all graphs); secondly, if not, this parameter is equivalent to the induced $m$-domination parameters for some fixed natural number $m$. Our results generalize the above mentioned result by Todorcevic, and imply further equivalence results. We also present an algorithm which, based on these results and some additional properties, proves that a parameter is induced with number 2. Our algorithm is not a simple one, but it is based on an already well-known algorithm, and we believe it is worth presenting here.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nGraphs are one of the most studied and simple abstract finite structures of various kinds with a large number of properties investigated since the time of its discovery by Euler. Many parameters on graphs have been introduced in order to describe the structure of graphs, and it turned out that many such parameters are highly connected, in the sense that two graphs have the same behavior under one parameter if and only if they have the same behavior under some other reasonable parameter.\nIn 1964, Vizing [8] introduced two parameters on graphs, which he denoted with X and Y. He conjectured the following two properties for these two parameters: X and Y are hereditary and X ⇒ Y (if a tree T has X then every subdivision of T has X). It is easy to see that every hereditary parameter is induced by X (and therefore by Y), therefore T is false. Todorcevic's conjecture [6] is a natural generalization of Vizing's conjecture and the statement can be reformulated as follows: if an hereditary parameter ϕ is induced by X then it is induced by Y. This conjecture remains open, but some progress has been made on it",
    "As images evolve in the digital realm, they experience many transformations – from geometric transformations (such as translation, rotation and scaling) to more complex, often non-linear signal transformations, e.g., from JPEG compression, filtering, and downsampling. Consequently, image-decoding algorithms can be applied to recover some or all of these transformations, resulting in a multi-stage recovery process, or an \"image unmixing\" process. Many image decoding paradigms fall under the broader framework of joint sparsity decomposition [1], which recasts this problem into a linear algebra problem [2]. With the advent of efficient deep neural network learning (DNNL) methods, the underlying linear algebra problem can be solved with DNNL, e.g., [2]. In this paper, we propose \"Double-DIP\", a two-pass DNNL algorithm that jointly decomposes arbitrary images into two layers: coarse-to-fine structural features and non-linear residual components. The DNNL optimization in each stage is guided by a separate image prior that is derived automatically by coupling a learned DNNL image prior to traditional image processing tasks, e.g., denoising, super-resolution and deconvolution. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art algorithms, including the popular Deep Image Prior (DIP). Our Double-DIP algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art DIP and other DNNL algorithms in the recovery of non-linear distortions in a variety of settings, including denoising, super-resolution, and deconvolution.\nFigure 17: The double-DIP algorithm decomposes an image into a coarse structure and a residual component by first introducing a coarse-to-fine image prior (left). It then adds a residual image prior before iteratively inverting the image decomposition (right). The result is a coarse image and a residual image that each contain different features, resulting in an overall reconstruction that is closer to the clean image.\nIn another section of the paper, Dr. Zhang describes the motivation for the work:\n\"In the past decade, deep learning has been shown to significantly outperform traditional methods in computer vision and related fields, yielding state-of-the-art solutions for many problems, such as image classification",
    "We present the first 3D numerical study of a novel emergent collective chemotactic mechanism driven solely by collective interactions. Unlike in traditional chemotaxis, cells in our model do not have chemo-sensitive receptors that respond to direct interactions with chemical gradients. Instead, chemotaxis emerges as a result of nonlocal correlations in a large number of non-differentiable coupled stochastic reaction-diffusion equations with both local and non-local coupling. For a fixed number of cells, the local interactions in this model are long range, which prevents the standard mechanism of chemotaxis by short-range steric repulsion or attractive alignment. We found that the emergent collective chemotaxis phenomenon is robust for a wide range of parameters, as is typical of many physical phase transitions. We demonstrate the novel collective chemotactic phase transition by a statistical measurement that directly counts the number of cells in each collective state. At low densities, the system is in a state in which the cells have widely dispersed and randomly distributed positions. However, in the high density phase, the cells quickly organize in sharp clumps as observed in experimental systems. In the phase transition regime, it is evident that the cells organize into large clusters.",
    "The research paper is a result of a collaboration between researchers at Huawei, University of Wollongong, and University of Adelaide.\nA network structure has been proposed that explicitly reduces confusion errors in semantic segmentation. It uses a special architecture that comprises a multi-channel feature fusion module for semantic segmentation and a global pixel attention aggregation module. The former constructs a single-channel feature through multi-channel feature fusion for all pixel values of a specific semantic class, whereas the latter emphasizes the role of pixels belonging to that class through attention. This improves the segmentation of similar semantic classes and helps reduce the confusion between these classes. In addition, the use of the global attention aggregation module makes it possible to avoid redundant computational effort. This results in computational savings. Experiments performed on the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that the proposed architecture significantly reduces the confusion errors and outperforms other similar methods.\nThe following is the full title, authors, and affiliation for the research paper:\nA Network Structure to Explicitly Reduce Confusion Errors in Semantic Segmentation, B.

    "Deep reinforcement learning has recently led to outstanding results on a wide range of games. However, learning to play Atari games remains challenging with a large discrepancy between simulated and real environments due to the unstable distribution of video frames.\n\nWe explore a novel approach to learn the complex interaction between action and state via a new type of auxiliary network (termed _action-state network_ ). Inspired by the fact that the relationship between the action and its consequence is unique for each game but might share the same characteristic among different games, we consider learning as an analogy problem and seek to mimic the relationship from heterogeneous auxiliary networks. Since each of them corresponds to a particular game in training, each auxiliary network is learned using information from a single game. Although an auxiliary network is trained with the different dynamics and visual features with respect to the target task, we still exploit similar characteristics among heterogeneous auxiliary networks as \"transferrable knowledge\" to facilitate learning on the target task.\n\nWe evaluate our method on Atari games and demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art learning performance on a large number of Atari games using only a small amount of auxiliary networks. Our method not only significantly outperforms the single-target-task-based baseline but also the multi-target-task-based baseline in real-time training with a minimal latency when evaluating on Atari games, which shows a great potential to be used for efficient transfer learning.\n\n# Bibliography\n\n1.

    "\"The four-qubit systems of states have been investigated to understand the consequences of the recently proposed strong monogamy conjecture. A general state in four-qubit system is described by ten independent parameters. The two-qubit state in a four-qubit system is described by five independent parameters.

We have discussed entanglement negativity in two-qubit and three-qubit subsystems for different combinations of bipartite entanglement classes in the four-qubit system. We have shown that, if bipartite entanglement in a given four-qubit system is genuine entangled (separable), then monogamy inequality for tripartite entanglement is violated for some of the three-partitions of a four-qubit system but satisfied for some other partitions. We have verified that, for bipartite entanglement of all the possible classes-i), ii) and iii) in a four-qubit system, the three-partitions satisfying monogamy inequality for tripartite entanglement are exactly the same. We have also shown that, for bipartite entanglement of all the possible entanglement classes in a four-qubit system, for the partitions of three-qubit subsystems which do not satisfy monogamy inequality for tripartite entanglement, entanglement negativity is the same.

    "\"Accurate and robust histopathology image (H&E) staining normalization and segmentation are critical to unlocking the potential of computational pathology for medical diagnosis. However, traditional supervised learning (SL) approaches require vast manually curated training image collections, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. Thus, deep supervised learning for large-scale histopathology tasks is infeasible. In this paper, we propose the constrained deep weak supervision (CDCWS) method for H&E staining normalization and segmentation. CDCWS is a weakly supervised deep learning framework that leverages weakly annotated unlabeled training samples and a tiny subset of fully annotated training samples. Specifically, we develop a deep network with a novel loss function that explicitly integrates supervision information from weakly annotated unlabeled samples and weakly annotated fully annotated samples. We further devise a novel constrained training scheme that helps to improve the segmentation accuracy by making use of the prior knowledge learned from the unlabeled data. We employ patch-based and fully convolutional networks and conduct comparative experiments on staining normalization and segmentation of kidney cancer. The experimental results show that CDCWS achieves a remarkable performance improvement in both tasks. In particular, the segmentation accuracy of CDCWS significantly improves up to 31% in terms of accuracy, and 21% in terms of Dice score.\"\nThe following is the full text of the abstract for a research paper titled \"Deep Learning In Computed Tomography Images Of The Kidney: Renal Lesion Segmentation Using Deep Learning Algorithms\" from arxiv.org:\n\"Purpose: This project aims to produce a fully automatic, accurate, and robust method to automatically segment kidney lesions from computed tomography (CT) images.

    "We consider the dynamics of a bubble generated by a submerged orifice. Initially, this phenomenon is an open problem in hydrodynamics. The only well defined initial condition is that the fluid flows into the chamber with an uniform velocity.

In this paper we provide the following analytic results for the motion of a single bubble, as well as a two-bubble case. For the single bubble we derive the equation of motion in terms of a dimensionless parameter, and show how the dimensionless velocity varies with this parameter. We also describe the evolution of the bubble radius and how it scales in terms of the dimensionless parameter. For the two-bubble case we present the equations of motion and show that the resulting acceleration of the bubbles is the same.

    "CRFs are typically instantiated with carefully designed hand-crafted features derived from unstructured learning. Recently, neural networks have been used to model structured learning of potentials. This works is based on the observation that, rather than hand-crafting features and learning them separately, a neural network that can jointly learn both the unary and pairwise features is a more efficient way. The main contribution of this work is to develop a method to learn structured tree potentials from unlabelled data (using a CNN backbone).\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nConditional random fields (CRFs) have been one of the most popular choices for structured prediction problems like object detection, segmentation and many others. CRFs can be instantiated with different types of potentials, e.g., first/second order, linear/non-linear etc. Potentials provide local structure to the prediction task but their form and complexity are typically limited by prior knowledge and domain specific design.\nRecently, the trend has been towards learning data-driven potentials for CRFs by using features learned from a neural network. A typical methodology involves training a deep learning model such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) with classification labels which are then used as features in the corresponding pairwise potentials. A deep CRF, as in [8], [9] can be trained in an end-to-end fashion where the deep model and the unary/pairwise potentials in the CRF model are all learned simultane-ously. The success of such approaches are limited by the choice of features to be used in the CRF which requires a large collection of labelled data.\nThere has been significant progress [10], [11] in the area of unlabelled data driven learning of structured pairwise features such as for multi-way multi-instance learning [12], [13] and other applications [14], [15], [16]. The use of unlabelled data can significantly reduce the need for labelled data. The CRF models discussed above tend to be limited to learning first/second order Gaussian graphical models whose pairwise terms consist of single input features. As these models are trained on data with no additional labelling, it will be ideal to learn unary as well as pairwise feature functions from unstructured learning. However, it is non-trivial to learn structured higher order potentials from unstructured learning techniques as the order of the",
    "Context Encoder Network (CE-Net) is a light and fast method for medical image segmentation. To deal with highly nonuniform distributions in anatomical locations, we propose Context Encoder which aims to model the context knowledge and extract a global image representation by encoding the entire input image. Since context encoder is incorporated into each encoder in the U-shaped network, CE-Net efficiently encodes the image context to predict semantic features that contain more spatial awareness. We develop a novel loss function integrating three types of complementary constraints including position constraint, attention constraint, and semantic constraint. With this new loss, a network can be trained end-to-end without using any extra external cues, such as a priori knowledge on labels or a pre-trained model. We show the effectiveness of our loss function with comprehensive experiments comparing with some state-of-the-art methods on medical and public anatomical data.

    "Deep learning methods have made significant advances in the field of image segmentation. However, most techniques are often limited to datasets that offer massive amounts of labeled data. Active learning aims to exploit the expensive annotated images as efficiently as possible. Previous works in region-based active learning are mainly based on uncertainty methods using Bayesian framework to estimate the segmentation uncertainty. Despite that uncertainties are useful criteria, they still don't provide information about how well the data sample can improve the model performance. Our work focuses on estimating how much an active query image can make improvements to the segmentation model. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to learn to query (LQ) for image segmentation. This novel approach is used for selecting queries effectively. The proposed learning to query approach is based on the idea that we can learn a model that can directly estimate how much a given data sample can improve the segmentation model. To enable efficient learning of our proposal framework, we also proposed a cost-effective region-based active learning (CEREALS). We introduce a cost-effectiveness network named Im2Diff, which can generate the improved image in pixel level using the segmentation mask on two input images to facilitate the prediction of improvements and the learning of our proposal framework. Experiments on the ISIC 2017 skin lesion segmentation dataset demonstrate our proposed model can make more informative queries with greater improvements and fewer queries.\nThe full text of the paper is found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14925.pdf\n#11 03-26-2022, 10:32 PM\nThe following is the full text of the abstract for a research paper titled \"Unsupervised Detection of Dementia From Conversations Using Language Modeling and Acoustics\" from arxiv.org:\nAs the world's population ages, early detection of diseases like dementia becomes increasingly important.

    "The abstract reads\n\nBackground and Summary: We propose the geometry of vectorial martingale optimal transportations and duality based on the Wasserstein geometry and its relation to convex duality. We begin with the definition of vectorial martingales of order p ≥ 1 from L^p space and prove martingale property for any p ≥ 1 and the p-convexity of vectorial martingales. The p-convexity theorem, the main result, tells us that any vectorial martingale is equal to the integral of its p-convex dual. This duality, the main theorem of this paper, plays a key role in the martingale optimal transportations. Next, we present an example of vectorial martingale duality and extend it to a more general duality between vectorial martingale and its p-convex dual. Based on these results, we suggest a geometry of vectorial martingales defined by three different convex subsets as convex hulls, envelopes, and extrema. It is observed that the martingle property and the p-convexity can be recovered by the three geometric definitions. The p-convex duality leads to a new duality between two probability measures. Two measures μ and ν are dual in the sense that μ is weakly in the same p-sublinear hull as some transform of ν. This duality is an extension of the Kantorovich duality. This duality may give a new insight into the optimal transport problem. The existence of dual measures and the characterization of when the dual measures exist and are unique will be left for further research.\nKey words and phrases: Weak p-sublinear hull, martingale, and duality\n\n\nA: Here's the summary of the paper, found here:\n\nWe prove the p-convexity theorem and dual theorem for\nmartingales.

The global models are constructed by homogenization of the local scales, while the local representations are\nbased on nonlinear upscaling. The multiscale methods are coupled by the principle of virtual\ndisplacement. The local scale representation is derived via a Galerkin projection of the\nglobal model onto the space of the local solutions. The global-local model is reduced by\napplying a proper orthogonal decomposition on the global model with respect to discrete\ndata. The method is applied to the Darcy scale model of a pressure-driven flow with\nnonlinear advection (quasilinear diffusion and convection).

    "Abstract.\n     Numerical schemes for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations have been developed based on particle methods that replace the continuous incompressible density by summation of density values defined on a set of spatial particles. These schemes are suitable for use in solving a variety of challenging applications including flows with discontinuities and sharp density gradients. However, the resulting discretized systems of equations are non-symmetric with respect to the standard inner product on the pressure and velocity vector spaces. This paper explores the use of algebraic multi-grid methods for solving these systems in two and three dimensions. We show that it is possible to solve these non-symmetric systems in one or two sweeps as in the case of standard symmetric systems, by using preconditioned conjugate gradient methods which have only a modest impact on efficiency, which allows us to solve a range of challenging problems. We note that the resulting algebraic multi-grid algorithms are easily parallelizable and, in particular, are amenable to GPU-based implementations.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are used to model a wide range of important systems in fluid dynamics and they are often difficult to analyze rigorously, meaning that it is common to resort to computational methods to examine particular solutions. Particle-based methods can be used to formulate numerical methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations that are particularly useful when simulating flows involving complex density gradients and other challenging scenarios [1,2,3,4,9,10]. These numerical methods are based on replacing the continuous density with a summation of values defined on a set of particles. These particles have a finite radius and travel through space according to the motion of the fluid they represent. This means that they are not constrained to flow along the nodes of regular grids (like finite volume methods) or to follow the discretized geometry of surfaces (like finite element methods). We call a particle-based method which is based on a summation of particle densities a particle-based method; we note that the specific type of particle used to perform the method is of little importance except when discussing issues such as computational cost and the ability to perform parallelization.\nRecently, a variety of numerical methods based on particle-based methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations have been developed.

    "\"Fast recurrent fully convolutional networks for direct perception in autonomous driving\nConvolutional networks are a key part of autonomous-driving computer vision systems and achieve superior performance at a wide variety of tasks, from dense semantic and instance segmentation, to key point detection, depth estimation, 3D registration, and semantic segmentation in LiDAR point clouds. The majority of these systems rely on a two-stage approach for dense image labeling, in which regions of interest are first identified and then independently classified. Such recurrent architectures can be slow, particularly in low-resource settings in which the per-pixel classification must be done in real time.\nWe present a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) designed specifically for direct image classification at 1Hz and greater, by leveraging the recurrent nature of FCNs to form a single, fast inference function for dense labeling across multiple images. In addition, we analyze and address each of the sources of inefficiency in a recurrent FCN and develop heuristics to significantly increase performance with respect to existing recurrent networks. We evaluate our method on the KITTI Visual Object Detection and KITTI Scene Flow tasks, demonstrating a 1Hz inference rate while achieving test set accuracies on par with or better than existing state-of-the-art methods. To encourage further development in the sparse and real-time settings, we release a KITTI Scene Flow benchmark implementation and evaluation pipeline that achieves a state-of-the-art result of 0.88 on that task. \"\nLink: https://towardsdatascience.com/fast-r...y-in-aut...",
    "This paper introduces a deep learning based architecture that incorporates physics based modeling to enable an efficient and accurate compaction of full range 3D ultrasound volumes. The method, named UltraCompression, applies a three-stage compression pipeline that leverages the existing multi-channel, multi-angle data characteristics to 1) downsample the volumes in each sub-range of multi-phase ultrasound; 2) extract the relevant features using a deep model architecture consisting of a 2D convolutional neural network and a 3D convolutional long short-term memory layer; 3) efficiently downsample the extracted features through a deep generative model based on autoregressive neural networks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is established through experiments using two large and publicly available datasets – the 2018 IEEE Ultrasound Image and Video Database (UIDB), comprising of 10.6 GB ultrasound volumes and 6.1 GB ground truth volumes and the UBC Ultrasound Research Group Ultrasound Database (URG UDB), comprising of 0.88 TB ultrasound volumes. The results reveal impressive compression rates for both the datasets that are a minimum of 50X and as high as 100X compared to the raw volumes while maintaining the overall image quality with minimal impact on key clinical metrics. \n\nThe paper can be accessed at the following link  [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10151).\n### 2019 - Deep Learning: A New Compression Framework for Ultrasound Volumes \nThe following is the full text of the abstract for a research paper titled \"Deep Learning: A New Compression Framework for Ultrasound Volumes\" from arxiv.org: \n\nUltrasound imaging has played a vital role in the development of modern medicine; but due to increased size and complexity of ultrasound data, there has been a growing need for new compression techniques.

    "Many combinatorial problems such as traveling salesperson problem (TSP) and vehicle routing problem (VRP) do not allow a simple solution method like dynamic programming (DP) and therefore it might be the case that no polynomial-time improvement method is possible. This has been used as an argument for a common view that no improvement method can be better than randomized local search. However, on the other hand, there is a wide range of problems that allow a DP solution, but where local search might outperform DP. It is therefore interesting to study whether or not simple iterative improvement methods can beat DP and what kind of properties a particular problem must have to allow such improvement methods to succeed.\nIn this paper, we consider the all-switches strategy method as a general tool to improve a solution to an optimization problem. (This method is often used as a baseline when evaluating new heuristics.) We show that finding near-optimum all-switches strategies for a given solution may be just as hard as solving the original problem. In particular, we show the two following negative results about the complexity of finding near-optimum all-switches strategies:\n(1) We present an example problem where for each algorithm the probability of producing a high-quality switching solution is upper-bounded by some small constant. This means that either the running time of that algorithm is exponential or that the probability of producing a high-quality switching solution is exponentially close to zero.\n(2) We prove that in a generic setting it is NP-hard to find a good all-switches strategy. This means that even if there exists an all-switches strategy leading to a polynomial-time improvement, the problem of finding such a strategy is NP-hard.\nThese results give evidence that the all-switches strategy method is far from a general approach to finding optimal or near-optimal solutions to combinatorial problems. This opens the question for methods that can outperform all-switches strategies.\nThe paper is written by two researchers at the University of Lübeck, Germany.

    "We introduce Box-Adapt, a novel bounding-box-based label-efficient medical domain adaptation approach. Box-Adapt leverages the bounding-box predictions that are produced by state-of-the-art general object detectors (i.e. Faster-RCNN) to bootstrap the target-domain label distribution and guide the training of pixel-wise semantic segmentation networks. In particular, we develop a three stage algorithm which uses the bounding box predictions to generate pseudo-labels for the targetdomain and uses a teacher-student framework for distilling knowledge from pixel-wise labeling into the bounding-box predictions. On three medical image segmentation benchmarks, Box-Adapt can achieve state-of-theart results for domain adaptation using up to 40× fewer target-domain labels compared to pixellevel supervised methods. The resulting model is also surprisingly effective on the completely label-free domain adaptation setting, where the targetdomain does not provide labeling even for the bounding boxes; Box-Adapt does not require any bounding-box annotations from the targetdomain and improves over baseline methods by a large margin (5.5% in Dice score compared to Faster-RCNN and 2.3% compared to a vanilla student model in the liver benchmark). Further experiments also show that BoxAdapt yields stronger generalisation properties compared to state-of-the-art pixel-level methods. We will release a codebase to simplify the use of this method.",
    "Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses multiple layers to process data to identify patterns and trends in large datasets. The two most popular techniques in deep learning for natural images are supervised and unsupervised networks. In supervised techniques, a neural network is fed large batches of images and their corresponding labels during training. These methods depend on the availability of large datasets with labels during training. In addition, they require a lot of processing power during training. In contrast, unsupervised techniques generate features using a neural network, and then apply another neural network to learn patterns without the need for a corresponding label. This method also requires a lot of processing power, but there aren't any need for labels during training. This paper presents a new approach for medical image segmentation by generating features unsupervised before sending them to a supervised network. This approach trains the unsupervised network at the same time as it is being trained with input and output images. This combination of supervised and unsupervised networks allows for higher accuracy compared to either of the networks alone. This approach could help improve segmentation efficiency in the future by using smaller datasets and less processing power. A novel ensemble of two independent deep learning models has been implemented as a means of identifying potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of brain tumors, thereby accelerating the diagnosis of brain tumors. The two-layer model uses a combination of two different deep learning techniques – convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) – to produce the best results when working together. The first layer, an unsupervised CNN network that aims to learn important features from input images; the second one uses a fully supervised GAN network to produce a final segmentation mask representing the brain. The results of a comparison test carried out by the computer system are then used to produce an accurate segmentation mask. A preliminary study was conducted to determine the feasibility and efficacy of this approach in identifying brain tumors within Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. This study confirmed that combining both networks results in high precision accuracy (up to 97%) for detecting brain tumor regions using MRI scans from multiple patients.\nIn order to address this problem and generate the final output mask, a two-layer ensemble (TLE) technique for image-to-image translation is proposed. A CNN is used as a feature extractor to generate deep feature representations",
    "A very common approach for analyzing an object's shape is to detect its curves and classify them by their geometrical properties into sub-categories such as edges, convex curves, concavities, and so on. Although many computer-vision based methods have been proposed to detect and segment curves on images, these methods have not been widely used to analyze depth maps or point clouds. In this work, we present a method to segment curves from depth images taken, for example, with the recently released Microsoft Kinect 2 device. The method relies on a combination of machine-learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with conventional methods such as region growing. We validated the proposed method on a set of objects which could contain multiple curves, and we could successfully classify the curves using only geometric parameters. We then performed a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the results with various state-of-the-art computer-vision-based methods, and we showed that the best overall performance is obtained with the proposed method, both with regard to accuracy and efficiency. As a direct by-product, we are able to generate very precise 3D meshes using the reconstructed curve structures.\n\nFinally we note that the results of this paper, and the workings of algorithms developed by the authors of this paper, along with many other research papers on similar themes, represent data from which more sophisticated machine learning algorithms can be trained.\n\nThere are many companies in the computer vision sphere, like Google and Microsoft, and a number of university-based research teams, all developing algorithms based on techniques like those described in the workings of the paper presented here.\n\nWe can imagine other related research projects being developed using the following as the basis to train algorithms that recognize the data of a similar nature:\n\n•\n\nCultural objects depicted in images taken at different times in different circumstances, to detect change\n\n•\n\nPatterns of behavior of people in public spaces\n\n•\n\nHuman faces\n\n### 5.2.22 Conclusions\n\nThis chapter has covered some very sophisticated techniques in machine learning and deep learning as applied to computer vision.

    "> This paper addresses three related problems of interest in signal processing and telecommunications: generalized all-pass filtering, the design of phasers for arbitrary time-delay-amplitude-distortion transfer functions, and the derivation of the group delay and delay-bandwidth product functions for arbitrary phasers. The focus is on coupled-line phasers due to the wide range of transfer functions they can implement. General theorems, proofs, and closed-form results are developed and applied to circular phasers (i.e., phasers with an integer number of coupled lines), which cover a very large range of phasers, such as band-pass, high-pass, all-pass, band-pass, anti-bandpass, etc. Several new results can be immediately derived from these theorems and proofs, including the ability to derive the group delay and delay-bandwidth product functions from an arbitrary transfer function and to design band-pass and anti-bandpass phasers for arbitrary passbands.\r\n\r\n> ## Disclaimer\r\n>\r\n> The content on this website is provided for informational purposes only, and is not intended to be used in any capacity for medical diagnosis or treatment.

And it was there that he first fell in love with Germany.\nIn 1959, with his career as a successful advertising copywriter in America already going strong, he was commissioned to write an hour-long television drama with a German theme.\nIt would have an English name and would star a young, unknown actress from the US - Tuesday Weld.\nThe film was called - and would go on to achieve - international success. It had a catchy title: Call for the Dead.\nThat same year, while vacationing in the Austrian Alps, he met his future wife, Maria, a divorced Dutch woman who had been working in Switzerland as an interpreter for American soldiers. They married the following year and in 1961 their daughter Gina was born.\nBy then, his career had really come together.\nCall for the Dead was the first of nearly a dozen bestsellers, several of which became highly successful television movies.\nHailey's reputation was made in 1963 with a novel called Hotel.\nThe action is set over a year in the life of the luxurious Grand Geneva Hotel, the setting for which is in reality based on the real Swiss resort that inspired and gave its name to the book.\nThe action spans several plot lines.\nThere's a murder involving a prominent politician and a beautiful actress; an American millionairess with a secret; a troubled and adulterous marriage; a young woman on the verge of taking a life-changing leap; a journalist trying to unmask the murderer; and a couple making the most of their first holiday together.\nHailey's characters are drawn with a sharp eye for detail and a keen sense of humour.\nThe action moves smoothly from drama to intrigue to romance and back again. It is a captivating read, particularly as every character's point of view is shown, in an unputdownable way, making the reader feel at home amid luxury yet privy to the secrets and confidences of the characters.\nIn 1968, the movie rights for Hotel were bought by 20th Century Fox for a",

The reductions will likely provoke protests from the large state prison guard's unions.\n\"California, in spite of all I'm going to present today, is still facing an incredibly serious budget situation that will require more tough decisions for the years ahead,\" Mr Schwarzenegger said.\nHe said he was proposing the largest education spending increase in the state's history and that if enacted it would mean the state would spend more on education than any other in the US.\nMr Schwarzenegger said he was also looking for $1bn in savings by moving state prison inmates out of existing facilities and building new low-security or medium-security facilities in some of California's rural communities and in areas already experiencing high crime rates.\nThe governor would also like to offer $6.75bn in incentives to developers of wind and solar power plants that would produce at least 1,000 megawatts of new electricity.\nMr Schwarzenegger's proposed budget also includes a three-year phase-out of the state's Redevelopment Assistance Fund, which is used to subsidise economic development projects by redirecting property taxes into a fund with few restrictions.\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6670308.stm\nFearful of economic slowdown if US Federal Reserve stops easing its monetary policy, Asian economies will slow growth amid a sharp fall in the value of the US dollar.The US Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates nine times in 2003 and three times",

Maldini had been working at his old club as a technical director. \"There is not a single problem between Maldini and the Milan coach,\" said Maldini's agent Davide Torchia. \"Milan had also told Paolo that he has to go,\" Torchia told radio network Rai. \"His immediate reaction is obvious: he wants to continue to work as a coach at AC Milan and not as a TV pundit. \"He thinks that Milan have to hire someone who can be a coach as well as a technical director. But the final decision is up to Milan.\" Milan and Maldini have worked together for 16 years. However, the six-time European champions' recent slump has seen Massimiliano Allegri leave Milan in search of a new challenge. Milan, who did not progress in this season's Champions League qualifying rounds, are eighth in Serie A - eight points behind Juventus who won the Scudetto last term. Maldini played for 17 years at Milan, winning six Serie A scudetti, five Champions League titles and the UEFA cup. He also played in the Italy team that won the 1994 World Cup, appearing in a record 124 consecutively matches for the country. He scored the only goal of Italy's 2-1 victory over Brazil in the 1994 final. Maldini retired in 2009, when he was captain of Milan. \"I know him really well,\" said Prandelli as he revealed his new assistant. \"He's a great person, extremely professional. I really appreciate him. I'd spoken with him many times and eventually decided to call him this way.\" Maldini is currently in the United States, where he will be working as a pundit at the Super Cup. It is there that he will meet with Conte, who will name his other assistants before the squad fly out to China. Maldini will leave his technical director role with immediate effect. His predecessor at AC Milan, Filippo Galliani, will carry on his role after being confirmed as the new president of the club",

Disney blamed the poor box-office performance of the film for a miss in its income forecast last year. The Securities and Exchange Commission said there were no facts to show that \"John Carter\" did less-than-expected Box Office revenue. In April this year, the film earned US$282m at the Box office, against an estimated US$300m production cost. \"We are pleased to have reached this resolution and we are looking forward towards continuing to grow earnings and generate value for our shareholders,\" said Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger.\n\"John Carter\" is a 3D sci-fi fantasy film that was based on Edgar Rice Burroughs's bestselling novel \"A Princess of Mars\". The film was directed by Andrew Stanton and was released in March last year. Disney also paid US$4m in penalties.\n\"I think that some of the problems at Disney were self-inflicted,\" said Jim Halpert, co-chief investment officer at Glenmede Trust. \"In a lot of ways they were overly cautious.

Gabrielle Giffords and the wounding of 13 other people in a weekend shooting rampage in Tucson. He was being held at the Pima County jail pending a March 8 hearing to determine if he is competent to stand trial. He has been on suicide watch.\nLoughner will be transported this morning to the state prison in Yuma, the Arizona Department of Corrections said in a news release.\nThe department wouldn't say whether Yuma prison is where Loughner will be detained or if he will be moved to another prison.\nThe state prison in Yuma is a medium security facility that houses inmates in a dormitory setting and has an on-site psychiatric area, said spokesman J.L. Meade.\n\"He has access to medical services,\" he said. \"He has access to mental health counselors, just as every other inmate does at Yuma.\"\nMeade said he didn't know Loughner's prison cell assignment or which building he'll be housed in.

These were brought down to 4.25% on 3 December, matching last year's low.\nThe rates were then cut to 4.1%.\nThe reduction in the official commercial deposit rates and the reduction in rates on UK mortgage loans, was designed by the Bank to give financial institutions more money to pass on to consumers in the hope that they would start spending, and so boost the economy.\nThe current official commercial deposit rate of 4.1% is the same as the base rate of Bank's base rate, though the difference between the official rate and the Bank of England's base rate has increased due to the rise in reserve requirements (see below).\nThe central bank has kept this rate unchanged since August last year.\nThe MPC makes its decisions independently of government but follows guidelines set by the Treasury, which, according to a Treasury spokesman, include maintaining price stability and",
    "US Open finalist Andy Roddick has spoken about his need for a new coach.\nRoddick's head coach Brad Gilbert stepped down from the role on Monday following the American's unsuccessful world number one bid, a day after a US Open semi-final defeat to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.\n\"There have been plenty of people who have reached out, and that's something we'll evaluate in the next couple days,\" the 2003 US Open champion told the New York Times.\nDuring the season, former world number one Jimmy Connors also helped out Roddick for a time but had a public spat with his pupil over a practice session.\nGilbert had held the reigns since July 2008, but Roddick has opted to retain the services of his fitness coach Andre Agassi.\nDuring the US Open run he lost to French fifth seed Tsonga 7-6 6-3 3-6 4-6 6-1 on Friday.\nRoddick, 28, is currently ranked second behind Rafael Nadal in the ATP rankings, and holds three Grand Slam titles.\nDuring his career he has also been coached by José Higueras and John McEnroe.\nThe following is the full text of a news article titled \"Brad Gilbert resigns from Andy Roddick's coaching team\" from BBC News:\nAmerican tennis star Andy Roddick will be hunting for a new coach after two-time Grand Slam winner Brad Gilbert resigned from his role in the world number four's coaching team on Monday.\nOn Saturday, Roddick lost to French fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the US Open semi-finals.\nAnd he now needs a new trainer ahead of the ATP Tour season finale in London at the end of the month.\nRoddick and Gilbert have been linked for many years.\nThe former world number two met the coach, who made the same journey himself with his own career, during his early days on the tour and the pair began working together with Gilbert in 2008.\n\"Andy and I have decided to part ways,\" Gilbert said.\n\"He needs a coach who can spend more time on the road with him, and is probably best served by a coach who has been successful in a similar capacity.\n\"This is the best time for us to make a change and to be",
    "\"Britain's defence budget is unaffordable and cannot be increased, says a think-tank's annual defence report. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) says other areas of public spending should be trimmed and taxes raised to pay for what it calls 'a minimum' defence of the nation and to help tackle youth unemployment. It criticised the decision to increase the number of aircraft carriers being built.\"\nI'm happy to see the BBC is still reporting on defence spending issues. It's also pretty refreshing to read their story on the report as well, which doesn't just focus on the headlines like most stories on this subject.\nIt's ironic, however, that the government has been accused of not spending money on national defence by the IPPR. The report says \"the UK's defence budget will be below the NATO norm by 2018/19\", but that is wrong. I would say we are spending between 2-3% of GDP on defence, which is pretty average for our North- Atlantic partners. In fact, the figures are pretty close to that of the US, who spends about 4% of GDP.\nThis is how defence spending has evolved since the end of the Cold War, when NATO was still fighting in the Balkans (Kosovo, Bosnia, etc) with the lowest defence budget on record:\nIt can be seen that the defence budget peaked in 1997-98 (~6,5% of GDP), then decreased in the early 2000s, followed by a sharp reduction in 2004, when a massive peacekeeping operation in Afghanistan was launched. In 2010, we hit the low point. In 2011, the budget was significantly increased to support the operations in Afghanistan and Libya.\nIn 2013, with the end of combat operations in Afghanistan, Defence got a small additional boost. But a majority of this increase actually went to the budget of the Foreign Office as part of the 'development-aid-and-security' fusion strategy pursued by the coalition government. As such, there was no major budget increase for the armed forces.\nBy 2014, the defence budget will have dropped again, back to the budget level in 2010. The coalition government has insisted in recent years that this was in response to the end of the combat mission in Afghanistan and a cut in the defence equipment programme which includes the procurement of aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy.\nBut if this is the explanation of defence's budget",

    "A U.S. government panel will vote on 17 August on a recommendation allowing use of painkiller Oxycontin as a treatment for chronic pain.\nThe product's backers hope the panel will recommend approval of low-dose pills - not higher doses intended as treatment for terminal cancer pain.\nIn 1996, Purdue Pharma, which markets Oxycontin, agreed to pay $430m (£257m) to settle more than 2,000 lawsuits.\nOxycontin is a controlled-release version of the painkiller oxycodone. It has been prescribed in the US to treat pain since 1995.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel will vote on whether it should recommend approval of low doses of Oxycontin to help people with moderate to severe pain.\nThe recommendation should be an important step toward making the drug available to treat patients with chronic conditions such as chronic back pain, an FDA spokeswoman said.\nHealth regulators in the US are under considerable pressure to relieve the acute shortage of painkillers because of the heavy abuse of the medications.\nIt is estimated that between 20% and 50% of those prescribed Purdue Pharma's blockbuster drug Oxycontin, a timed-release form of the opioid oxycodone, diverted the drug to others for recreational abuse.\nIn 1997, the FDA approved the low dose form of Oxycontin for pain, which was an initial cause of disagreement between the company and its critics who believed the FDA should not have allowed the drug for pain when it was already on the street.\nThe FDA approved low-dose Oxycontin in February 1997 and then in September 1997 the government said all versions of Oxycontin should be restricted to patients with \"severe\" chronic pain. No definition for \"severe\" was given and doctors questioned why the FDA would not explain the meaning of \"severe\".\nThe FDA refused to change its recommendation. The New York Times has reported that the FDA said patients receiving OxyContin for acute pain were in a \"precarious situation\" in which they were on too much of the powerful opiate drug.\nThe FDA said a \"disproportionate\" number of people died while on the high-dose regimen. But Purdue Pharma disputed the reports saying the government had misquoted the number of patients who suffered adverse effects while on the drug.",
    "More than half of British parents have received a phone call from their daughter's or son's school blaming the behaviour of their child on playing violent video games, according to new research.\nA study reveals many parents have received a telephone call, received a report from a teacher or attended a parents' evening.\nThe report by the children's charity Barnardo's is based on feedback from 3,300 parents and teenagers.\nIt says the industry has \"a great deal to explain\" if parents are concerned about the effect of video games.\nThe report, which is entitled Playing the Field, says parents fear the effect on their children.\n\"We are not saying violent video games should be banned,\" said Barnardo's Chief Executive Martin Narey.\nMore than a third of parents in the study said their children did not need to play the game, while one in 10 said playing such an extreme game could encourage their children to take risks and behave dangerously.\nOne mother who did not want to be named said her 10-year-old daughter would come home from school behaving in a \"violent and aggressive\" way after playing a game called Manhunt on her mother's GameCube.\nThe game is rated as an 18 certificate, meaning it is unsuitable for those under 18.\nShe said: \"In the game, the players have to stalk and then kill another person.\n\"I have taken the game off the GameCube and am not going to let her play it any more. \"I am upset about this as I do not have a computer or game console in my bedroom.\n\"It is upsetting that the company could market such a thing to children.\"\nThe research also found that the vast majority of mothers and fathers did not think computer games were responsible for their children's behaviour and that parents wanted schools to take responsibility.\nThere is also evidence that violence in video games can have psychological effects.\nUniversity College London published research in May which found a link between playing violent video games and aggressive thoughts and behaviours in teenagers.\nPosted by Vixxen at 12:05 PM 0 comments\nPosted by Vixxen at 1:14 PM 1 comments\nPosted by Vixxen at 12:56 PM 0 comments\nThe following is the full text of a news article titled \"Parents' complaints lead to probe\" from The Independent:\nParent",

    "Booker Prize-winning novelist SPARK has led a British literary charge as the books longlisted for this year's international prize were announced.\nBut two other UK writers, Zadie Smith and William Dalrymple, have been left out of the 13-strong list.\nThe six-strong Booker Prize judges included the controversial \"Fifty Shades\" author EL James.\nSpark, who won the Booker for her 2007 novel The Take Home, was on the list along with her compatriots Rachel Kushner, Kamila Shamsie, Robert Macfarlane and Will Self. [...]\nThe Man Booker International Prize is a sister award to the better known Booker and recognizes literary excellence in foreign-language fiction published in the UK.\nThe Man Booker International prize was inaugurated in 2005 to celebrate writers who do not use English as their primary language.\nThe winner will be announced on 18 May 2016.\nI find this interesting because if you look at the list of novels longlisted for the 2016 Man Booker International Prize, you will notice that four of these novels are translated from Russian: Elizaveta Dushechkina's Zolotoy telenok (The Golden Calf), Vadim Levental's The Hottest Dishes Of The Planet, Alexei Ivanov's Snegoviy stan (The Snowy Steppe), and Alexandra Olshanichaya's Uspenskaia liniia (The Icon Thief) - four of which were shortlisted for the 2016 Big Book Prize. One would think that the Big Book Prize jury might have chosen to give this prize - or at least some of it - to one (or more than one) of these four novels as a signal of international openness or recognition of Russian literature (which it did not, as readers will know), so one might wonder why the Man Booker International Prize jury felt the need to include these four Russians alongside five other foreign writers. Or maybe the four Russians were selected because they had won or been shortlisted for the Big Book Prize and were therefore already sufficiently \"prestructured\" or \"signaled\" in the eyes of the jury as the international representative Russian author or authors to have been chosen? Of course these four novels have all been translated into English and are therefore also competing in a translated category as well.\nAs you can",

    "\"Manchester United manager Sir Alex Fergsuon has all but ruled defender Nemanja Vidic out of the rest of the Premier League season, while striker Javier Hernandez has had his comeback halted by injury.\nDefensive stalwart Vidic, who faces surgery on a knee injury, could even miss the start of next season.\nIt means the Red Devils will again be without the services of two of their most influential players for key fixtures. Hernandez will sit out United's FA Cup showdown with Fulham and their Premier League match against Arsenal.\nThe Mexico star had made a quick recovery from a shoulder injury and lined up as an unused substitute in the draw with Arsenal.\nBut Ferguson said he would have to rest Hernandez again this weekend.\nThe United boss told MUTV: \"I don't want to risk him, to do him any damage. I can't risk him in a game like that.\"\nThe United boss has a number of injury concerns ahead of the game against the Gunners.\nVidic looks set to be sidelined for the rest of the year, along with midfielders Michael Carrick (knee), Tom Cleverley (ankle) and Darren Fletcher (fitness).\nMeanwhile, Rio Ferdinand has only just returned to training after a month out with a knee injury.\nThe only good news to arrive this week has been the news that Wayne Rooney has finally been given the all-clear to return to training. The striker has missed United's last six games with a gashed thigh.\nHowever, the bad news surrounding Rooney has been the fact that he will face a FIFA ban of three matches if his appeal does not succeed. If he is banned, then the 26-year-old will be out of contention for England's Euro 2012 qualifiers against Montenegro and Bulgaria.\nWith the return of Rooney and Hernandez, United would have had an additional five players to select from, but both men will have to wait until the visit of Blackburn on March 22, before they return, assuming they are passed fit by then.\nThe only other news to come from United camp on Friday morning was the news that Anders Lindegaard has joined Aalesund on loan until the end of the season. In return, United will land young Norwegian defender Jon Olav Haugen.\n\"I think",
    "The Beastie Boys have won the first major test of a controversial British Copyright Act which makes it easier for performers to take control of their sampled recordings.\nJudge Andrew Smith has ruled that the American group's record label Grand Royal can control future uses of the drum loop to 'Funky Drummer' by Clyde Stubblefield.\nLast year, Grand Royal won a High Court case against the MCA group, which owned Stubblefield's recording. MCA then lodged an appeal.\nBeasties sample\nThe Beastie Boys use a sample of 'Funky Drummer' for their 1989 hit 'Paul Revere' from their album Paul's Boutique.\nThe Beastie Boys say they bought a licence from the American producer of the track. But Stubblefield took MCA to court over his royalties. It was then that MCA challenged Grand Royal's ownership of the drum loop.\nThe Beastie Boys, who claim they are fighting for freedom of music makers, argued that they bought a licence in good faith. MCA however says Stubblefield was never paid for the work on 'Funky Drummer'.\nJudge Smith said: \"If this were strictly an issue of the interpretation of the licence agreement, it might be said that Stubblefield's interest in the matter is at an end because of the sale of his interests in the music to MCA.\n\"However, in my judgement there is a right of action against the subsequent user of the recording, Grand Royal, for unauthorised copying.\"\nJudge Smith ordered MCA to pay Grand Royal's legal costs and to hand over its copies of the drum loop. He also ordered Grand Royal to pay MCA's legal costs.\nSource: bbc.com/news\nRetrieved from \"https://www.beastieboysbook.com/wiki/index.php?title=Beastie_Boys_win_sampling_battle&oldid=1390\"",

    "KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The Ukrainian Parliament on Wednesday cut in half the percentage of state enterprises up for sale under a much-criticized privatization plan approved in April, but refused to roll back all the measures or cancel privatization of the nation's most lucrative natural gas pipeline to Russia.\nLegislation submitted to the 450-member chamber by President Leonid Kuchma also would raise the state's share in any subsequent public stock offering by 10 percentage points, from 10 percent to 20 percent. The package was supported by a coalition of Communists and a liberal faction that control the lower house.\n\"The Parliament can amend the package and bring it closer to the position of society, which does not approve of privatization,\" Kuchma told a news conference. But he defended his record on privatization, saying that the program, which was only two weeks into a planned three-year cycle, was succeeding.\n\"According to our results, we made some mistakes during the first two weeks of privatization, but it's not something that we should be ashamed of,\" Kuchma said.\nVitaly Klitschko, head of the opposition Democratic Initiatives party, said that Kuchma's proposal was \"not as favorable as we had hoped. But it is an important start.\" Parliamentarians from the presidential bloc and Prime Minister Anatoli Yanukevych's party rejected the proposal in the lower house, despite indications that it had the support of a majority of lawmakers.\nLawmakers, however, appeared sympathetic to the idea of abolishing a special tax exemption for state-owned corporations. They have criticized the program's terms of sale, which were negotiated secretly by Kuchma's economic reform team, as highly favorable to businessmen.\nUnder the plan approved in April after little debate, the Ukrainian government was to cut its stake in large-scale state companies to 50 percent from its current 100 percent by October, and to 25 percent by January 1999. Companies would then be sold to the public in an initial public offering.\nThe government had earlier planned to keep an interest in each company at 25 percent, but the proposal to increase the state share in any public offering was seen by some lawmakers as a concession to the opposition.\nMany in Ukraine have criticized the plan as favoring insiders at the expense of ordinary taxpaying Ukrainians.",

A system built with today's top processors can take 100 CPUs.\nA desktop can run on four CPUs, and even if they were idle when you purchased your system, you still had to pay for them. Now the idle CPUs on many of those four-way processors will give Sun customers computing capacity they can turn on as needed, according to the company.\nTo use the software for the program, called \"PowerTower\", you will need a Sun server with one or more four-way processors and the PowerTower software installed.\nAnd once you turn it on, your system must be connected to Sun's Global Grid, a network of computer centres around the world. That means that you are giving a key into your system to anyone on the grid. So no pirated software sharing files on Sun equipment.\nCustomers have the option to run the software on PCs with Windows. Microsoft announced that it too was working on a service called \"utility computing\" back at the Comdex show in Las Vegas on Tuesday.\nMicrosoft described the computing service as a way to \"democratise computing\". But it hasn't outlined how much access there will be to a super computer and how much they will cost. And many customers might not",

This appeared to reassure some investors that he remains determined to keep a lid on India's fiscal deficit.\n\"We need to raise some amounts in the short term and we will be doing that through taxes on the richer and wealthy sections of society,\" Mr Singh said.\nBut some business leaders were less than impressed.\n\"What I am hearing is very bad news; any attempt at raising taxes is bad,\" said Vishal Agarwal, chairman of pharmaceutical company Dr Reddy.\nOn Monday, Moody's credit ratings agency changed its outlook on India to negative – the first such downgrade in seven years.\n\"The government's effort to reverse growing fiscal stress by raising taxes will likely fuel the economic slowdown,\" the ratings group said.\nIndia is one of the world's largest economies but has been slowing down, with growth forecast to hit 6.5% in the fiscal year that ends in March, down from 8.1% in 2006.\nTo prevent a slide into recession, Mr Singh said the government would spend 9% more on schools and 20% more on infrastructure this fiscal year.\nFarmers are to receive benefits equal to about $110m.

    "\"When Eminem's track Lose Yourself came out several years ago, it was adopted as an anthem by US black and Latino communities.\nIn the film 8 Mile, Eminem's alter ego, known as B-Rabbit, makes his living by freestyling improvised rhymes for groups of kids who hang around outside a record store. As the film unfolds, he moves on to perform at talent nights and later becomes an MTV star.\nEminem was the first artist to become famous outside of the confines of the black and Latino communities by singing in broken English and employing the cadences and rhythms of the US inner cities.\nThis type of hip-hop music is known as gangsta rap and it can be traced back to pioneering Los Angeles rappers Ice-T and NWA in the 80s. They set the fashion and the tone, as well as the aggressive music, for hip-hop in the US. But in terms of musical structure, and the rhyming patterns, they were clearly influenced by the music from Puerto Rico known as reggaeton, an off-shoot of another Puerto Rican genre, reggae.\nSome of best known reggaeton artists are Don Omar, Ivy Queen and Daddy Yankee. Its themes are usually based on the social problems of the Latino community, but its musical characteristics, such as the use of reggae's characteristic drum patterns and the constant repetition of the chorus, makes it very danceable and commercially appealing.\nA young generation of artists, known as the new school, broke the established barriers in 2003 when they started rapping entirely in Spanish. They are mostly based in South America but they are also popular in Puerto Rico.\nWith their homegrown roots and strong national identities, these rappers see themselves as a counterbalance to US rap. For example, the Argentinian rapper Dread Marley, whose father is Chilean, is a symbol of the political, social and cultural struggle for the rights of Argentinian immigrants. He released his album Desde la Guerra [Since The War], in 2003, referring to the conflict between Argentina and the UK over the Falkland Islands.\nRap in all its different forms is a true reflection of the social and cultural tensions in modern US society and a product of its musical melting pot.

    "(4) John Higgins and Mark Williams have joined Ronnie O'Sullivan in the battle for the £10,000 first prize in the first stage, but the Rocket is the only one of the tournament's former winners left in the running.\nO'Sullivan kept his powder dry the same way as he did in the final of the Betfair World Open in Cardiff last weekend, saving his best for the closing stages against Ali Carter.\n'The Captain' produced breaks of 102, 64, 68 and 105 to sweep Carter aside with five frames to spare, but O'Sullivan remained level-headed. \"It's a long tournament, I don't expect to get to the final tomorrow morning.\n\"They'll be all in trouble and needing to win, so we'll see how we get on.\"\nWilliams, seeking to defend the title he claimed 12 months ago in Preston, won't have a walk-over, but his form appears ominous as the only player to have gone through the campaign unbeaten with five wins out of five.\nThe Cardiff man beat O'Sullivan 4-0 in the second round at the Crucible, but O'Sullivan won't be afraid of Williams as a result. \"I think I played great in the World Open final, but he played even better than what he did in the Wembley final,\" he said.\n\"You can't expect to play great every match. It depends a lot on the balls you get. If the balls aren't coming in true there is no point in playing shots, and in the final you needed to be making the right balls at the right time.\n\"I don't think the conditions were right for what the players usually play. They weren't suited for us.\n\"But in the qualifying tournament they will be suited a lot better, like I said before it's a good way to start the year because it's just pure pot-ball.\n\"It's easy in respect of the snooker but it's very hard to play well.\"\nO'Sullivan and Williams have just missed out on a semi-final meeting in the event which has been played in Portsmouth, Sheffield and Preston in the past, but they have the consolation that at least one of them will be in the £200,000 World Championship final in Sheffield",

Not just from the perspective of graphics and polish, but also in terms of content and scope.\nFor me, the biggest revelation is that Battlefront will offer a mode that will allow you to select a faction and battle through an entire war from start to finish. The first two games were so tightly focused that a player would get bored of the multiplayer maps in one short week of playing. However, Battlefront will allow you to complete your journey as an Imperial Stormtrooper or Jedi Knight through the epic series.\nAs with any Star Wars game we've seen recently, it is hard to predict how Battlefront will progress. We don't know when it will be released, how much it will cost or how long the online game mode for it will last. The first reveal of the game didn't come until over two months ago. It is likely we won't know much more until E3, which will come around in a month or so.\nEven so, Star Wars Battlefront is the first video game in nearly a decade that fills a Star Wars void in our lives. We will have to wait and see how the game progresses as the months continue, but right now it is looking like the Star Wars game we have all been wishing and praying for.\nFrom my review of Star Wars Battlefront which was posted to thegamereview.net on June 25, 2019:\nStar Wars Battlefront is the second \"modern\" Star Wars game which is set before the events of Episode 4: A New Hope.

DICE is now a subsidiary of EA.\nStar Wars Battlefront is the only Star Wars game which allows you to play as the Empire or the Rebellion.

    "A Federal jury on Thursday found five North Carolina residents guilty of massive spamming campaigns in the first conviction brought under a controversial new anti-spam law from the US Congress. The law, which took affect on January 1, makes it a crime to send more than 1,000 messages to Internet users that contain false or misleading information. A second conviction under the law is underway against seven people in Atlanta, Georgia. The federal statute carries maximum five-year jail terms and fines of $11,000 (£5,200) for each conviction. Spammers have long relied on the anonymous nature of the Internet and the wide reach of Usenet newsgroups and Web bulletin boards to boost their businesses. The convictions represent a victory for the Federal Trade commission, which brought eight cases under the new law after it passed. The FTC said the defendants made approximately $300,000 in profit over four years from the sales of software products advertised in their junk emails. In one example cited as a part of the trial the court heard from several people who had had their computers compromised by spyware, or covert software that captures passwords and Internet accounts. The defendants were indicted in February on counts of conspiring, wire fraud and access device fraud related to the alleged spamming campaigns. The charges each carry a maximum 20-year prison term and a $250,000 fine. Three of the five North Carolina residents were present during the five-hour proceedings. The verdict comes one month after the US Supreme Court ruled spam was not protected as free speech.\nFor more information about this case, click here (http://news.cnet.com/us-duo-in-first-spam-conviction/2100-7349_3-5860350.html)\nThe following is the full text of a news article titled \"US spyware conviction\" from news.com.au:\nA US couple have been convicted of installing a powerful spyware program on hundreds of unsuspecting users' computers worldwide to steal personal information and pass it back to spammers and scammers.

    "Malaysia's parliament has passed a bill to increase the ceiling for foreign ownership of Islamic banks to 100%, reports the BBC's Sue Phillips in Kuala Lumpur. The government had previously agreed to relax limits on foreign ownership of Islamic banks to 70% from 20% but the bill had been opposed by Islamic lawmakers and some foreign shareholders. The move was intended to attract major global Islamic banking players to enter the market, which is believed to be worth $3tr (£1.8tr), reports Reuters. Malaysian officials believe Islamic banking will be an important growth sector globally and want to be at the centre of it, said a cabinet minister last month. Islamic banking focuses on ethical and sharia-compliant values, and does not allow for interest. Western banks have been slow to invest in Islamic finance, and there has been criticism that Islamic finance is still fragmented and underdeveloped, according to Reuters.\nLabels: Shariah Finance\nMURIC demands prosecution of Muslim father who raped daughter and impregnated her with quadruplets\nThe Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has called for the prosecution of an unidentified Muslim father that raped his daughter and impregnated her with quadruplets, Punch reports. The Muslim rights group made the call in a statement signed by the organisation’s director, Mr. Ishaq Akintola. Akintola argued that the father has violated the teachings of Islam in such a wicked manner. He said, “Islam strictly proscribes incest of any kind. If some men have the idea that they can go into the bedroom of their daughters to have sex with them, they are dead wrong.” MURIC urged the Police to fish out and prosecute the Muslim father in the event that it has been unable to do so due to his high social status. The father had earlier told Daily Post that he was sorry to the family. The four babies were born two weeks ago. According to the father, he is prepared to bring up the children in a manner befitting of their status. The case had raised an uproar even as the father was identified as “Ogbuefi Nnamdi”, a retired soldier who was reported to have raped more than 500 women during his military service.\nLabels: Muslim Clerics, Muslims and Sexuality\nMuslim Cleric Threatens to Release Nigerian Christians\nThis is the full text of a news",

    "\"A gadget show has declared MP3 downloads a Christmas present which will become a mainstream part of household life. On Monday and Tuesday of this week, the Ideal Gadget Show Live was held at Olympia, London. It is an exhibition of products that are available on the home market and on TV shopping channels. Last summer, the MP3 format went from being geek culture to mass-market as a result of the boom in hand-held players, such as the Rio. But the MP3 format is also being used on standard CD players - and it is the big hit of the show. \"MP3 is still the fastest selling, but with the advent of MP3-compatible players coming from both Sony and Philips, this Christmas is likely to see MP3 entering the mainstream,\" said Richard Taylor, editor of the Gadget Show. There is a growing number of different ways to record digital music. MP3 is the most widespread and uses a special technique to squeeze audio files on to CDs. It uses 'lossy' compression - a bit like a Jpeg file on the internet, which contains only a small amount of the information stored in a complete picture. The information that MP3 leaves out is 'invisible'. However, the audio signal is not as cleanly recreated (a process known as 'degraded') as with other compression methods. The compression allows MP3 files to be stored on CDs - but the standard audio quality of music on a CD is very high. So, many manufacturers have devised devices which can squeeze MP3 files on to standard, non-MP3 compatible (CD-DA) equipment. Gadget Show's Paul Catherall said: \"There's two reasons for the growing MP3 market. One is that the devices are getting smaller: you can now get a palm-top that plays MP3.\" And the second reason, he said, was that it was getting cheaper. \"The prices are coming down, not only of player devices, but also the CDs themselves.\" The exhibition's organisers say MP3 has gone from being a gimmick to part of the big technology companies' 'long-term business plans.' At one stand, the Sony Memory Stick, a new product that works on Sony's Playstation, Compact Disc and Minidisc players, is being touted. The Sony product will play music stored",

    "The National Security Agency is worried that terrorists could be using cheap, fast-moving phones as part of plans to attack the US. The NSA believes that small terrorist cells could be buying and then re-selling cheap mobile phones to avoid being tracked and traced. \"It is possible that small terrorist cells could be using untraceable pre-paid phones as part of their planning and attack methods,\" an official told the House of Representatives intelligence committee in a classified hearing last week. NSA Director Gen Michael Hayden told investigators he has assigned his Counter-Terrorism Center to analyse how likely such a threat is, according to ABC News. \"The threat doesn't need to be a small one, nor does the cell need to be large in its size, just the ability for their communications to be difficult to track and penetrate,\" Gen Hayden said. \"That capability, in many ways, is available today.\" He added that NSA staff have had preliminary conversations with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, but he declined to say whether the CIA has been informed. A spokesman for the Counterterrorism Center said that he could not comment further. \"The NSA has been at the forefront of identifying ways in which the terrorist community makes effective use of commercial telecommunications services,\" he told Reuters. \"These tools provide an important counterfoil to the terrorists' ability to communicate and collaborate with each other. \"The NSA, in concert with the US intelligence community and our federal law enforcement partners, is using these capabilities and resources to collect relevant terrorism-related communications.\" In February 2006, the US Congress ordered the intelligence agencies to draft plans for dealing with the threat of using commercial phones for terrorist attacks. Gen Hayden said it would be hard for the NSA to pinpoint the small, short-lived groups planning an attack. \"They are small, they have very few face-to-face contacts, they rarely meet in the same place twice and they are constantly on the move,\" he told the investigators, ABC reports. The NSA said it was committed to addressing the new threats and that Gen Hayden had also recently told a senior military group that the agency was \"working to acquire information about terrorists' use of wireless phones\" to carry out attacks on the US. \"Such phones can be bought by a terrorist in one country, used for a while and then dumped in another country without it being possible to link them to terrorists,\" a Congressional staffer told Reuters.",

It was brilliant to see him come down the wicket, but he also has the ability to push for the single and take the bowling on as well.\nThere is more depth to his game than maybe was previously recognised and that is down to the work he has put in with our coach Ashley Giles and Mark Chilton, our head of cricket, this winter. It’s all about understanding your strengths and he is now playing with that freedom in his batting.\nSean is someone who has played a lot of T20 and he is more than capable of carrying that form into four-day cricket.

Images printed on premium paper are almost indistinguishable from what you would get from a lab.\"The colours are much richer, they are very saturated, very rich and vivid,\" says Mark Pickard who runs a photographic studio in London. \"I'm a professional photographer, but I now use these printers,\" he adds.The main advantage of these machines is speed. Professional photos are printed on light-sensitive paper and then need to be immersed in a chemical processing tank. A lab with professional machines can print three images a minute at maximum, while the new printers can manage 30 or more.The inkjet printers can print on more than just photo-specialised paper too, and can be used to make photo-realistic reproductions of artwork.Although printers like Lexmark's PictureStudio claim \"lab quality prints\" that are \"instantly dry and ready to handle\", they are not quite perfect.\"You won't see dust on them the way you would on a lab print because they don't go past a vacuum chamber,\" says Pickard.Nevertheless, you can go online to buy blank photo paper and have it delivered the next day, at a fraction of what you would pay in a store.\nThis article uses the product example \"personal printers\" to describe the differences between \"professional photo printers\" and \"personal printers\" and shows how \"the latest personal machines can now produce results that rival those from a photo lab, for a fraction of the price.\"\nNext: What you can expect to find in this article.",

    "The family of the late Jewish-German philosopher and scientist Martin Buber have spoken out against a musical based on his life. A song in the show praises Josef Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister. The musical is based on an autobiography published by the philosopher before his death in 1965. It is playing to packed houses at the Theatre des Westens in Berlin. \"Everywhere we go there are standing ovations or bouquets of flowers for Martin,\" said his granddaughter, author Danna Buber Neuman in an open letter to the theatre. Her father, Benjamin Buber, also spoke to the German news agency DPA. He said he was \"confused and upset\" by the characterisation of his grandfather, who was born in 1878 and died at 86. \"My grandfather was very different to the man presented in the show... he would probably not have recognised his own life as presented in the musical,\" Buber Neuman said. She said that in his autobiography, which had been published posthumously in 1968, Buber described his love for \"peace and justice, for my culture and for my people.\" The family's open letter says the musical was \"in part based on the autobiography of my grandfather. We are not permitted to make corrections to it, to add other perspectives or facts, which have been revealed over the past 50 years\". The critic Peter Zoller has written to the theatre, asking them to remove the offending song. He says he has written to the theatre because of the \"shockful and inhuman characterisation\" of Goebbels. \"It is a scandal, an offense and a terrible injustice,\" he said. \"To turn the Jewish-German philosopher Martin Buber into a tool of fascism and anti-Semitism, it is unbearable.\" The Buber family say the author has ignored the \"political events of our time that are the antithesis to his beliefs - racism, totalitarianism, genocide and terror - and present them as something familiar instead of something repulsive.\" \"Instead of confronting the reality of Nazism and the Holocaust, he paints them as something familiar,\" the open letter states. \"To this day, we cannot understand why he would write this.\" Buber Neuman said she and her family were \"deeply saddened.\" \"We find the fact that this musical is playing in Germany especially disturbing.\"",

    "Tony Blair has dismissed reports that he is being driven out of office due to the war in Iraq.\nThe former chief of the defence staff Admiral Lord Boyce gave an interview to the Times newspaper claiming Mr Blair would not be PM after the next election and he was trying to engineer his replacement as leader.\nThe PM said he had never had any ambition to lead the Labour party for all eternity and insisted he would run for a third term with or without a full-time job.\nMr Blair said it was \"not a job you can do forever\" and he expected to be \"out of office, probably fairly soon\".\n\"If it is a matter of my ambition, then they are wrong. People don't become politicians unless they want to serve the public so I am not in there for myself, I am in there for the public.\"\nThe comments will be seen as an attempt to head off claims made by Admiral Lord Boyce - Mr Blair's former military affairs adviser - that the PM was trying to arrange the departure of his closest allies.\nHe said on the Today programme that there was no \"plot\" in relation to John Prescott or Gordon Brown, who have both been mentioned as possible replacements for him.\nAdmiral Boyce said he made the interview because he was \"disgusted\" with Downing Street tactics and the PM's handling of the media. He told Newsnight that Mr Blair should announce he was \"stepping down by the next parliament\" and \"be gracious\".\nMr Blair's office confirmed he had been in touch with Sir David Manning, the prime minister's foreign policy aide, who left government to return to a full-time job in the financial sector.\nBut Admiral Boyce dismissed claims the pair were plotting to replace Mr Blair even though he appeared to be using Sir David as a conduit for his views.\n\"The way I have understood it is he has not been in any way involved, other than in giving a little informal advice to him,\" he said.\nSir David's role and that of other close advisers is thought to have been examined by the cabinet secretary Andrew Turnbull in anticipation of the publication of his report into the leaking of the 45-minute tape.\nThe BBC correspondent noted in a later post that other people interviewed by Mr Turnbull included the editor of the Daily Herald, John Moloney, and the former editor of",

I felt great, but [Johnson] is the best in the world and he showed it today,\" he said.\n\nThe example given has two parts separated by the sentence I was thinking. The sentence has three parts of equal length. We can use the sentence to identify the phrase boundaries, as illustrated in Figure 4-1.\n\nIn the first part of the sentence, Johnson is the only content word. As the subject is a proper noun, it is tagged as a common noun and assigned a NP role. The adjective too is assigned a role of A with a part of speech of A. In the second part of the sentence, strong is not a noun. It does not fit any part of speech pattern. It is not a verb, because there is no subject such as he in this part of the sentence. Nor is it likely to be an adjective that would be associated with the second NP, runs. It is a nonword without any grammatical structure, an unknown word that may or may not be a part of sentence.\n\nTo process the example sentence, a processor should first determine words and their parts of speech. It must identify the content words that are nouns (N) and verbs (V). The words in each of these two categories should be separated into content units. The content units are the phrases. Once all common nouns and verbs have been assigned part of speech tags and phrase roles, the next step is semantic analysis.\n\nFigure 4-1.

    "_Coming out as Bi/Pan is so hard for so many reasons. It's hard because when you grow up you realize that the world isn't as accepting as you'd like it to be. You realize that even if you're loved and accepted by your family and peers that as you grow up being Bi/Pan would make you an outcast among your own kind and your peers. It's hard because unlike other LGBT people you are hated by the community that you identify with and are so close to and you are often put at the bottom of the LGBT hierarchy. It's hard because in this world people have their own understanding and views. Like most people would rather have a gay friend that has sex with men than a Bi or Pan guy who has sex with both men and women. It's hard because it is hard to come out as one. Some Bi/Pans don't even come out because of their fear of being rejected completely and being socially exiled and ostracised. It's hard because you're always expected to \"explain\" (or \"justify\") yourself to the \"Bi curious\" or \"Bi Curious\" because they have different \"ideas\" and understandings of it. It's hard because you are the one most misunderstood and you are the one that has to explain yourself and your preference to the people who are ignorant of your existence. It's hard because people question your lifestyle and your preference not because they want to know more or learn what being Bi or Pan is all about, but because they want to argue with you and make you feel shitty about yourself. It's hard because when we get that first kiss and when we fall in love with our first girl that's it, you're not coming out as anything else. So in order to avoid hurting themselves and others they choose to remain Bi, and not come out and just be happy with the one they love, but at the same time they know that if they were with a man, as with a bisexual man they'd be accepted by their peers and not be treated like an outcast. It's hard because no matter how much you argue with them you just can't get them to agree and understand that your preference (and I call it that because some people think of it as a choice and just because others can choose theirs, and you can't choose a preference that they've chosen,",
    "Hi, everyone! Since my last post is more-or-less forgotten, I'd like to post what I found.\n\nThere is no way to post this kind of material without it sounding very crazy (it certainly sounds that way to me!), but if you look into everything I'll be listing and looking into, you will hopefully see that what I think is going on, is definitely and without a doubt happening.\n\nI'm a software developer (I've developed programs that run on cellphones that are capable of working as GPS location devices, I've developed software to test the integrity of networks, etc). I'm a devout Christian, and not one of those crazy Jesus freak types. As I said earlier, I am a believer in God, and it doesn't matter what name you attach to God. I happen to be Christian just because that's the religion I was brought up with.\n\nI'm married and have a child. I'm an American, and when my family immigrated here (I'm not sure of the exact date, but either my Grandfather or my Father entered the US prior to WWII), they, like a lot of other Italians and Eastern Europeans were given refugee status. They were given land that was deemed not good for farming, and a few plots of land that were very marginal in upstate New York state. None of my family have ever been farmers (my mother was a housewife, my father owned and operated two laundromats that he later sold in order to go into computer sales and rentals), but they still made this area they were given part of their heritage.\n\nI left that community of New York when I got married and moved to Florida for economic reasons. While there I went to school at UCF, got a BS in Comp. Sci. and later a Masters in Computer Info. Sys.\n\nCurrently I reside in Colorado with my family with both my parents having died and being buried in the upstate New York community I grew up in.\n\nThe events that I'm putting forth here started a long while ago, but some of the events I'm detailing here happened recently, and were the things that I found concerning regarding the events that started a long while ago.\n\nA long time ago (I can't really give dates because I don't remember exactly how old I was, but I'd",

    "Is it possible to cook grenades?\n\nNo. Grenades can't be eaten. I have been cooking grenades for my enemies for many years.

You need to be careful with grenade explosions.\n\nWhat is the best way to use grenades?\n\nI use grenades for cooking and for killing enemies.\n\nWhat is the difference between a grenade launcher and a bomb?\n\nThe grenade launcher is small and easy to use.

If someone does something I don't like I will mentally call them out and put them down. I will find myself thinking that the world should burn them up, and get the most heinous form of death possible. I think of my friends or family, and find myself just hoping they get hurt bad like really really. I think it's because of this that I keep losing friends and I don't know how to not lose friends. I hate it. I have had this type of mental state for just a bit over 2 years. Before that, I would never think of doing anything like that. I was always the kind person that everyone loved. It was only 2 years ago that things changed. I even went to my doctor about this, and I was basically just told to relax. I have tried many things to reduce this terrible mental state I am in and nothing work. I have gone to therapy and took prozac and the anti-depressants didn't help.

    "Hello, I had a dream and I remember that I had it a month ago: I think that I was having the dream in that time, for some reason I can't remember it, but I remember remembering it... In the dream, there was some kind of a war between a group of humans and some kind of an insect. In the middle of one of the battles some powerful figure appeared at the battlefield to see the fight, he had a crown on his head and on his hand, there was a special staff with some unknown magic written on it. \nI tried to find the meaning of my dream a month ago, and I've read a lot of material about what to do, what not to do.\nI have recently come to understand what I have understood. Now I understand that everything that happens in the dream is always something real. \nI also understand that the fact that the dream was repeated a month ago means that I understand all the information I need for the present time. \nIs this true? \nWhat does this dream mean and is there another meaning to it that I am not familiar with? Does some kind of information remain on the staff after the powerful figure appears? \nSincerely.\n\nA: The Dream\nIn my opinion there are many ways of interpreting such a dream. The most obvious interpretation, however, is that you are being put back together again spiritually and physically. The figure in a crown is clearly representing the king - like in chess. There is a board in the background. The war takes place on said board. The staff can be interpreted as a chess piece and the figures can represent various other pieces. The crown is a symbol of royalty.\nThe dream can also represent a war between the physical and spiritual. The war is in the spirit and the material world and on the earth. Thus a kind of 'divine force' will be placed on Earth to help you. There was some kind of crown on top of this figure in the dream and this can symbolize a king or a leader coming to help you. I think this could be Jesus. He is the King of Kings.\nIn addition, the crown on top could represent the crown of victory, as the staff with the strange writing",

Some rants are done in an attempt to make a point, to get others to understand their point of view. Others rant as a form of entertainment, to get them through the day. Regardless of their purpose, people use rants to vent their frustration and anger. This can be a productive way to get out the anger and frustration you feel. They can also be a good way to vent your frustration and anger at others or society in general. What you should be aware of, though, is that rants can have a negative effect on your health if they are not handled properly. If you use rants to get anger out of your system and do not have any other outlets, this can lead to a number of health problems. Rants can also make you feel guilty and guilty after they are over. The key to making rants work effectively is to find something at the end of the rant that you can vent your frustration and anger on. This will help you to feel like you have done something good and that there is no way to get the rant out of your system.\nr/rants\nA rant is an expression of anger or frustration that is meant to be heard in the form of a written or spoken expression of frustration and anger.

    "I am a 16-year-old girl. A couple of years ago I was abused. Not physically. Not sexually. Just a guy abusing me. I can now say I am a victim of emotional and verbal abuse. For some time I was extremely depressed. I tried to hide it with jokes and my personality. I made the mistake, however, of feeling sorry for myself and being bitter. I never told anyone. No one knew. I wasn't really close to my friends, they didn't know me at all. I knew there was nothing I could do about it except try and cope with it as best as I could. There is nothing to hate more than yourself. You need that one person to tell you everything will be ok and it will be fine in the end. I knew I couldn't be that person for myself. When this person comes into your life you realize that everything happens for a reason. It's not the easiest thing to cope with but it's not the end of the world. In the end you become a stronger person. And if I can, you can. It takes patience, but you will achieve what you set your mind to.\n\nTo this day I still think back to that time and how much I was a bitch to everyone around me and how I hurt people I've loved. I never knew why I thought like that for the longest time and that I never realized how much it hurt others and myself. You never know what someone is going through but when you think deeply about it maybe it was you who had to go through that at some point in time or know someone who did.

If you're in a place in your life where you think you can't cope, there is light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAll I have to say is that I have been a better person ever since that time and I now realize why things happened to me.

    "_So, I've seen a ton of people asking about a potential adaptation of Doki Doki, and I finally put together some ideas I have that may allow it to work, if it can work. As you'll see, I made several assumptions when putting this together (and I'm sure it is more full of holes than your favorite sock, but I hope this gives you an idea of what might be possible if we were able to get an adaptation done.)_\n\n_The first item I want to address concerns the age of the protagonist and the potential age of an actress to portray her. If I am correct, Komaru is 19 years old in the game, though in the VN this is not explicitly stated (we know only from the school records). This is why she has an underage sister who she is responsible for, and part of the reason why she is so hesitant to pursue (or perhaps simply admit she's interested in) her feelings for Monika. In terms of actresses, the actress who plays her in the anime adaptation was 15 years old at the time, which is an important detail if you've seen the anime. So for that, I went with 17. This seems to be right in that sweet spot of not-quite-18, but still having a hint of innocence. (It was also an age of a girl in school that one of my friends and I were very much interested in at the time (we were in high school at the time, and she was only a year older than we were. That's right... gah!), so I figured, if I'm going to include that, I may as well include that as well.)_\n\n_So, with the age set, I moved on to some of the more obvious points._\n\n_The first big problem I see is the fact that, as we saw, the school is not very big. This does not bode well for the ability to show the characters moving around to different classrooms. With each room only being utilized for one class, and that class being shown through text boxes rather than in-game animations, it doesn't look like there is a way around this. I think the best bet in this case is that they would break the game up into multiple \"episodes,\" each dealing with a different class and its student and teacher pairings. In",

I'd like to know how much these additional services would cost and if they're worth the extra money.\n\nI am looking to hunt for deer, ducks, and bears (black bears and brown bears). I am okay with hunting small game, too.\n\nI would also like to know if there are any particular rules associated with hunting in USA. For instance, some states require a special license.\n\nPlease be patient with me. As I said, I'm a beginner in the US and I'm here because I would like to have a great hunting experience.\n\nBest regards,\n\nUser 6\n\nThe following is the full text of the post by the same user 6 titled \"Thanks!\":\n\nI would like to thank you for your replies.

    "I'm 26 years old. I used to think my parents and grandparents are crazy because they are so pessimistic. Now my friends and I are around 26 years old and we are already saying the same thing. Is life just one long downhill journey with only a small boost at the start?\nFor example. It is impossible for you to get a top job now in your industry. There are too many more qualified, experienced, better-connected people who have been working their asses off since they can remember. It is not enough for you to be a good person who tries to make a difference. It is not enough for you to be someone who works hard and pays their bills on time. It is not enough for you to be someone who does their homework and goes through the proper channels.\nSo, instead of spending your time hoping to succeed, you can just spend it resenting the fact that you failed to. You can spend all that energy hating everyone and feeling entitled. There are too many people who want what you have now. You don't have a leg to stand on. You have nothing to offer. It is not your fault that you weren't born with enough connections, experience, or qualifications to do your job well enough to prevent the company from falling into financial trouble. You didn't make enough sales.\nWealth inequality is not a problem, but it is no less prevalent than it was before. It is just that it is getting worse, and it isn't our fault. Money doesn't buy happiness. There are people who work hard, try their best, and get very little. But there are people who are just awful. They never work hard and still get a lot. We can't control the way we are born, but we can control how that affects us. Life is a struggle. And it never ends.\nIf you think life is fair, chances are you are rich, because life is not fair. Some get more than others. Some do more than others. Some are born in a bubble of privilege, and others are born in an abysmal hell. Some grow up in families with two loving parents, and those parents were able to stay together and raise their children. Others have to grow up alone, or with an absent parent, or a mother that doesn't love them as much as they love their other kids.\nThe world isn't perfect.",

    "I had read about the NX1 the other day and thought this will be a good comparison to see how well the NX compares to the others. The NX2 seemed good as well.\nAnyway, I purchased the NX1 (for $999) and I feel this camera is a great all around camera, but I've found some odd quirks while using it.\nThe first thing I noticed it the image quality. At first, I thought the quality of this camera was actually worse than my Canon 550D. The colors were just so wrong it looked bad. If I had never used another camera, this wouldn't have been such an issue. I was just blown away with the picture quality coming from my 550D. I would say one of the main issues with this camera is the ISO 2000+ looks flat and the JPEG processor in the camera just has a hard time giving you the best quality possible. I know this is a mirrorless camera, but it also is a camera designed by photographers. Maybe Nikon got this wrong? I can tell you after spending a few hours playing with this camera, I find myself using manual mode and adjusting the sharpness and color. My 550D almost never needs to do this, and I use this almost exclusively in auto mode.\nSo I want to show the pros and cons of this camera:\nNX 1 Pros:\n1- I want to tell you, I am blown away with the video quality. I have always wanted to get a nice camera with good quality video, and this is it. Its about 2x the quality of the 550D. It records at 1080p30 natively and I have shot 1080 at 30fps, 24fps, and 60fps using VLC (which by the way will have to adjust your video to 30fps). There are other options, but this is the only one that works for me. 60fps is a great option to slow footage down or freeze motion if you are shooting a sporting event.\n2- The OIS is awesome in this camera. I have used this to shoot some videos of my son playing and the OIS was very effective and smooth.\n3- The camera is very small and light-weight. It fits well in your hand and is very easy to carry.\n4- The screen swivels around.",

    "So, I don't know if it's just me (which I very much doubt) but the thought of driving gives me such a feeling of dread. It's really difficult to explain, it's like a physical feeling of stress. I was fine driving before I was 17 and I had my license for 5-6 years. I started feeling bad while driving around 18 and I was OK until a couple of months ago when I started feeling bad while driving in the city that I moved to, where I live here\nThe only thing I can think of that really helps my anxiety while driving is music. It's very weird but if I don't hear music with my speakers on, I feel dizzy and like I've lost control of my body even though I've driven for 4 years. Like I don't feel in control. This happens even when it's a clear road and I'm driving on a speed that's low and not even close to my maximum speed (which is a lot cause I drive a convertible but don't even ask). Sometimes I'll feel bad in the winter for no apparent reason but then something I like to listen to will come on and I'll calm down. The only other time I feel bad is when I'm driving at a lower speed in a busy city because of stop and go traffic.\nI don't have anxiety attacks or panic attacks in general, I'm not depressed and my driving performance is top-notch and well practiced. I used to drive a lot to other cities for work where I lived in the other town and I was fine. I also used to drive the same car I'd drive here and I still drive the same car here. I'm not sure if it has anything to do but I have Asperger's too so it's common\nIt feels like I'm more anxious now than ever especially since the last time I drove I was just fine until I drove on the highway and it felt like my head was going to explode. I drive on the highway a lot, it's the only way to get to my house. I love my house and I could lose it cause I'm too anxious to drive, I feel like I'm losing my mind or something.\nThe thing is, I don't get this way when I ride as a passenger. I'm not as anxious and I like it more in some ways.",
    "I was a teacher for one year in 2003. I taught first grade which meant I had a class load of 25 students.\nHere’s a snapshot of what a day looked like in February:\nWhen you’re outnumbered that much, you need rules and boundaries. Every day one student came in with crayons or scissors from home. At this point it was just a given. A constant reality which had become mundane.\nSo you put your foot down and they cry. You make a rule and they test the waters. And if they push it enough, you have to make the big decision. Will you take their stuff and risk further tears? Or do you let it slide one more time and then deal with the inevitable repercussions?\nAnd the result was that everyone suffered. The student who got kicked out of that social unit got to see me struggle with some very painful internal debates. My rules become murky, uncertain. I lost respect and authority within my own eyes. How could I ever make a rule stick if I couldn’t even enforce one?\nThe kids who didn’t have items taken away saw that rule as unenforceable and weak. The next time they brought crayons or scissors they were safe because there was no consequence. My authority was gone.\nI was exhausted at the end of the day. And I was at the end of my rope with the constant battle. You can imagine my relief when parent/teacher conferences rolled around.\nIt was that time of year when parents come in for a 20 minute glimpse into their kids’ education. I had become very close with the mother of one student in particular. From my perspective she was the most involved, engaged and thoughtful parent I dealt with all year.\nShe came to us that night and sat in on a meeting where her son was discussing his behavior. One of the teachers mentioned how he was having some difficulties with his transitions.\nIt was right there at that moment that I realized the answer to the question.\nThe answer is not to tell the child not to have anything with them. That’s far too passive. What I would have preferred would have been to tell a student that when any of this stuff happened, he would have to stay inside at recess for a period of time. But I couldn’t",

Also I don't think I need to call to an urgent care or ER.\nI had covid tests 10 days ago to go to my country and i don't have any symptoms (temperature, congestion, fatigue, taste, or smell loss.).\nIt seems you're not feeling so ill that you're thinking of going into a medical facility and potentially need to be admitted for your own health. Your feeling of unease and anxiety about Covid is probably your main symptom!\nYou might find it helpful to watch the YouTube video - It's only a cold - but it's Covid.\nYes you were exposed to Covid. No, there is no reason to assume you have Covid. It's not even clear you are currently positive for Covid, but it does happen that you can become infected and then have antibodies but never show symptoms. Or perhaps you are showing non-classic symptoms of Covid. A Covid test will not tell you whether you have antibodies (been infected) or the virus (positive).\nIf you feel well but are uncomfortable, you can either be reassured that the Covid symptoms didn't arrive on the plane, so to speak - you still can pass them on to others.

    "I feel like I've been seeing a lot of comments lately about how people are disappointed with Alberius's gameplay and don't enjoy it as much as Euden, which I've personally been enjoying playing, but Alberius has been great for me. I've been having some fun with his gameplay and love using the gun, but I have to agree with some of those comments that say Alberius's playstyle feels \"restrained\". It's too easy to get caught on certain obstacles and just feels a little too slow sometimes. I'm not sure what kind of adjustments can be done to improve the gameplay, but if anyone has any ideas, please let me know! I'm a big fan of Alberius and want him to be as good a character as Euden, so any advice would be appreciated!\nAlberius (Japanese: アルバリウス) is a playable character in Fire Emblem Heroes. He is the son of King Ephys and the younger brother of Eir. He was imprisoned by the Mad King Gharnef for attempting to bring peace to the kingdom of Magvel, and was later rescued by the player's forces.\nIn his childhood, he fell under Gharnef's spell and became the Mad King's willing slave. Since then, he has been working to free himself from the spell's influence. At one point, however, a young Gharnef came to visit Alberius in his prison cell and introduced himself, telling him \"the path of kings should come to an end.\" The two were seen laughing over the thought, and this later became the reason why Gharnef would want to kill Alberius in order to break free.\nAlberius is an unlockable summon in Fire Emblem Heroes. He and his descendant, Albrecht, represent both the Royal Family of the Kingdom of Dukedom of Magvel. He is allied with the Royal Guard, and is an unlockable summon via a special questline.\nAs Alberius was originally the only male member of the Royal Family of the Kingdom of Dukedom of Magvel, and he was the only one to survive the family massacre by the Duma, he and his descendants were seen as symbols of peace and prosperity in the land until his death. After his death, he and his descendants were replaced for Duma's symbol of evil. Since",
    "\"I'm trying to create a new piece. However, the first line of every verse I try has turned out to be the same melody-wise as an existing folk tune. It's pretty frustrating to be stuck when trying to create something. Any suggestions?\"\n\nThe following is the full text of the question I asked as a result of reading the post:\n\n\"Hey! I found this post that you made, about not being able to break out of a melody/rhythm, and having melody-wise issues. I actually had a similar experience, when I originally attempted to compose my song, before it was finalized. I had the first line of the verse that was so similar to what you described, and it was actually quite difficult for me to break out of the pattern I'd created. One night, in a fit of inspiration, I literally wrote the lines that followed on a piece of random paper, because I didn't have a notebook with me. Well, that was the turning point! As the process was ongoing, as I was creating more of the song, I didn't find myself as stuck as before. You sound like you're a very creative, driven and intelligent person! So I really don't think it will take as long for you to break out of that pattern. Maybe I could make a suggestion, just a small change to what you're doing. Maybe it's worth trying, just as an experiment, and if it doesn't work, you can always go back to what you were doing before? I know it can be hard, because I've been there myself. But you sound like you're a driven and determined person, and I'm willing to bet you can push through this! One suggestion is to try writing this piece in another key. The reason I say this is because when I wrote that piece, it was in A Minor, and I felt like the melody/key fit its essence quite well. Later on, as the song developed, the key remained in A Minor, but you have to know that before I finished it, I started having second thoughts. You see, I thought it wasn't unique enough to be in the same key for the length of the song. So I tried experimenting with other keys, in terms of the melody of the main piece of the song, for the song to be in,",

When you upgrade a piece of gear, it can be purchased with a few extra coins.\nIf you have a slot on your armor that is not a full set, you can't use it to buy the full set of a piece of armor. And that is a problem. When you buy gear, it comes with an upgrade. But it is an upgrade from your current armor. This means that even if you have a full set of armor, you still can't upgrade your gear.\nThis is an example of one of the problems I've seen with many RPGs. Your character has a set of things they use and they can't use them to \"upgrade\" their gear. The problem with this is that it makes it difficult to upgrade your armor. In my opinion, it's a lot easier to upgrade your character then it is to upgrade their set of items. I'm not sure what you're going to do if you have a set of armor, but you can't get",
    "> If \"lesson\" were plural and \"lessons\" the singular form, wouldn't the singular form be \"lessen\"?  I.e. the reverse of all other English singulare plurals.\n\nI know that such things have happened before. \"Feather\" becomes \"feathers.\" There seems to be a bit of variation in plural forms of Latin words borrowed into English. However, the fact that there is a counterargument to the form that you suggested means that there is no need to change it.\n\nA: To understand the question, just remember that a few centuries ago, English and Latin were the same language.\nBoth \"feather\" and \"feathers\" derive from \"penna\"/\"pinna\".\nI would think that if we could have borrowed \"penna\" instead of \"pinna\" then there would be almost no need for the singular form \"feather\" as we would have had a perfect pairing.\nHowever, that was not to be, and in that case we had to resort to using \"feather\" to cover both singular and plural uses (as we do with other words such as \"scissors\"). As we do not \"pin\", so we do not have \"pennes\", \"ppenna\", etc.\nSo there is no singular form needed - the singular form \"feather\" was created by our forefathers in order to accommodate the dual nature of the plural \"feathers\".\n\nA: The same applies to \"lemmings.\"  This is the singular form.  It was originally intended to be \"lemming\" but this was not standard and was thought of as plural.  For some reason, this became the singular form and the plural form became \"lemmings.\"\n\nA: You're not wrong.  \"Lesson\" would be the singular form, while \"lessons\" is a plural.  See the answer by \"John M\" above for an explanation of why.\nI've always pronounced lessons /ˈlɛsənz, ˈlɛsən/. I don't know any other American speaker that says\n/ˈlɛsənz, wɛsə/ - but I know some British people who do.\nAnd I should point out that the British \"lessons\"",

I want to be able to know when someone attempts to breach the security system on a constant basis, so I decided to use the Raspberry Pi for this purpose.\nI used a Python script to open ports on the Pi so it's able to connect to an external IP. I connected it to a VPN, but to save data, I disabled it. The script also creates a log file which should be stored in a Dropbox account I've set up. This way, if the Pi gets breached, I can see when and how the breach happened by looking at the logs and determining how the logs were transferred to my Dropbox account. All good.\nBut, then I realized that there's no reason I can't create a \"cryptominer\" within my setup that should allow the Pi to mine some coins. This way I can earn some coins while also making sure my system is compromised; it's win-win!\nI have no idea where to begin with creating code for this. How do I set it up? How do I set up a mining pool? How do I even get started coding? It's all very unfamiliar to me. But if anyone could point me to some resources that would help me get started, I'd greatly appreciate it.\nsubmitted by jasonto to MineBitcoin [link] [comments]\nDApps are currently running on EOS\nI am the developer of EOSBet, it's currently one of the largest DApps running on EOS and I want to let you guys know that we are still here.

    "In 2023 a genetic disorder was discovered which affects a small portion of the human population. Some scientists believe that the disorder will eventually become a global epidemic if a cure is not found; and some believe the disorder has been created purposefully.\n\nThis disorder is known as 'V2'.\n\n'V2' is a virus which destroys the brain's ability to form memories, in other words; the brain is constantly being rewritten. The only way to preserve memories is to write them down.\n\nThis virus is spread through sex and blood; it will not affect those who are past the age of thirty.\n\nSo here's where things have gone to hell.\n\nThe government cannot cure the infected. Some scientists believe this virus is the 'end of the race'. Everyone is scared and fighting among themselves for a cure. The world economy has collapsed; people are forced to work for money.\n\nIn short, the disorder has made humans turn to animals.\n\nThe children are different. They cannot be killed; they are all born with the disorder. Their memory cannot be restored and the brain constantly rewrites itself. Children born with the disorder are all called 'Ghosts'.\n\nThese children have a short lifespan; around thirty years. Their entire life span is focused on one goal: to find out where they come from. If a ghost is a normal person's child, he/she can restore memories which have been lost, in other words, he/she can restore an old brain (a normal brain) which has been destroyed by the virus.\n\nThe rest of the population are referred to as'monsters' (people with normal brains).\n\nMost people do not care for ghosts, as they're born with the disorder. The world is too preoccupied with their own survival to pay any attention to the Ghosts.\n\nA cure has always been a dream. People have never been more divided. Some scientists have found a way to cure the infected, but they're reluctant to make it so public.\n\nSo, the cure was never released to the public. People were afraid that someone could misuse it.\n\nIn the end, humanity has been destroyed; humans no longer exist. Instead, zombies have taken over, and only a few humans live in groups of four. Many animals are now extinct; due to hunting,",
    "When I was younger, I was always very introverted and a loner. I was definitely one of the shy, awkward kids at school. Nowadays, I've become a much better communicator, but even after all these years I still often seek out solitary activities/hobbies. There's an undeniable sense of joy/freedom in being a reclusive loner, because there are literally no obligations, demands, commitments or requirements for your actions. Every second you spend can be spent alone (this, of course, is only the case if your job isn't too demanding). There are also very little to no consequences for being alone for extended periods as a loner. If you do something weird/embarrassing in public and no one is there to witness it or tell anyone about it, you're good.\nEven when it comes to dating, people seem to think it's a perfectly normal thing to do, but I can't help but question the thought process. Theoretically, a lot of people get together, spend time together with each other, and break up because 'it's not working out', and they both seek other dates in the next relationship. But why the need to always be with other people just because? I'd rather be alone and not have to deal with drama, lies, etc.\nSure, some people find it easier or more comfortable to simply spend 'quality time' with their loved ones, because they feel the need to keep their relationships with their loved ones healthy. But why do people need to see each other all the time? Why does it seem like there's this huge pressure to constantly be with other people? I feel like people spend more time with each other, and they feel obligated to hang out with each other because they want to avoid being alone, when in fact, I feel like that's pretty much what loners/solitude-lovers seek out themselves, but we just don't have the motivation to stick with it. We have no friends to feel obligated to, so then the next step to not be alone is to simply be in a relationship. But having a relationship doesn't mean that you're not lonely.\nNow, of course, I recognize the benefit of having at least one best friend that you can talk to and hang out and bond with. But that's not what I'm talking",

    "My girlfriend recently had a baby, and I recently found out that her anxiety has been terrible. I don't remember exactly how she described it, but I had been under the impression that one of her major anxieties was naptime and transitioning to daycare.\n\nI work the early-morning shift (6–10 a.m.) on the days that she's supposed to go to daycare, so I go get her and bring her home to my house, where she'll sleep for the few hours that I'm at work. The problem with this is that I find it hard to sleep during the day, and it's been especially bad over the past week because she started sleeping only in 20-minute increments. I'd fall asleep while she's still awake and keep going as she wakes up (she's loud when she wakes up).\n\nIn the past day or so, her mother told her that it didn't matter as long as she was sleeping at daycare, and that I could sleep in a hammock near her stroller so she can see me and feel secure.\n\nI can appreciate what her anxiety is doing to her—she doesn't feel secure about napping in the stroller unless her mom is awake and keeping an eye on her—but her mother's suggestion is not at all practical and she probably knows that.\n\nHere's my concern: how can I tell her that I'm trying my best and that I don't want to feel like I'm \"doing it wrong\" without feeling like I've hurt either of their feelings?\n\nThe following is the full text of a post titled \"Anxious that I'm a 'wimp' and need to'man up'\" from reddit.com.

    "I've known all of my friends and family since my mother was pregnant with me, so we've all grown up together. In addition to knowing them since before the day we were born, we have all gone to the same schools and grew up in the same town. I think this is the biggest reason why my life has differed so much from the rest of my friends. It's easy to compare and contrast yourself with your friends' lives when you've all experienced the same things, and you can compare who has been promoted or who's in what class as you grow up. At the end of the day, however, you're going back home to your own parents. In my case, this was a single father, who was a lot younger than my friends' fathers and mothers. My friend's parents worked full time, whereas my dad worked a little bit here and there. We also lived in a small house and we had a very small budget for food and other necessities, something my friends were spared the worry of.\n\nWhen my dad first started working for himself in 2010, we started going to his offices during the weekend to visit him, which my friends weren't able to do. After seeing where and what he does for a living at his young age, it also made me want to be a businessman. When I told my dad, he said he thought it was strange, as there were hardly any teenage boys dreaming to become a businessman rather than an athlete or an actor for example. He wasn't exactly impressed either, but he was quite flattered that I wanted to be just like him, and we bonded over the subject of business. It has only been recently, however, that he's come to see it as a more positive thing.\n\nNow, there's no one to compare ourselves with anymore, but even back then I was already feeling the difference in how I would describe the quality of my life compared to my friends'. The rest of our lives had been the same so far. We all did the same thing every year like clockwork, but I think as I started feeling the difference that there were other things I need to do, to help my father as he helps me.\n\nSo now I try to contribute to the household whenever I can. I do the dishes (which is rare in my country), I help my dad pay the bills and I try to be more",
    "A couple weeks ago my laptop went into the infinite reboot loop due to HP Recovery manager. I made sure to make another recovery thumb drive and make a System Restore flash drive, plus another just in case, as a precaution with no problems over a year and a half of use with the thumb drive in and my windows 10 operating system running just fine. In the first 3 months since having this laptop, I used Windows 8.1 OS and it was smooth sailing over the year and a half.\n\nI got the laptop in early September 2018, the day of my birthday, as an early birthday present and a surprise from both my parents and my dad who worked at Best Buy as a sales associate.\n\nIn early April 2020, my laptop was in perfect working condition. I made sure to back up my data, files, etc. when I backed up to my other hard drive and made sure to make a system restore flash drive, which was the only thing I used with my laptop.\n\nI was watching videos from someone on my YouTube homepage when my laptop suddenly restarts after I had been watching video tutorials on YouTube for a couple of days.\n\nMy laptop was suddenly put into the infinite reboot loop and there was no way I could fix it. I tried different methods but it didn't work. I put my system restore flash drive in my computer and followed the prompts but it didn't work. Finally, I put my thumb drive in and let it go for a minute when it said something about a driver that was failing to work and I quickly removed my thumb drive.\n\nAfter I removed my thumb drive, the computer rebooted and worked normally but with all the files and data being inaccessible to open.\n\nAfter doing some research, I got on my computer and found that one of my laptop's drives, C, was failing to work and that it crashed and reset over and over again without me being able to fix it.\n\nI kept trying to run my recovery drive through my thumb drive but after three failed attempts I got tired of it so I took off the battery and put it on to charge hoping it would let it install my recovery partition and go back to factory settings. After the laptop booted up, after a minute or two, it went back into the infinite reboot loop.\n\nOne of the methods my friends gave me online was to hold down",
    "My name is Brandon and I'm 21 years old. I've been out of college and holding full time jobs for 5 years now and yet I've had no real luck at being able to build up any meaningful, professional, social life.\nI've had many jobs, starting my first one at 15 at a convenience store and have continued since with different levels of employment. The jobs have ranged from working minimum wage fast food jobs at McDonalds and the local pizza hut to working more customer-oriented jobs with cashiers and managers. I've never made the same level of money and have been forced to relocate myself to different places in order to continue any hope of having a stable income through my career. The last job that I worked on was as a cashier at an upscale grocery store and it paid me just under $10 an hour...which is great! I was happy because I was going to begin a whole new chapter in my adult life, but it turned out that this chapter would be short due to the fact that I was forced to relocate again (long story).\nMoving locations is really hard for my situation as I don't have any friends nor do I have a car. I don't know much about a city that I've lived in for 2 weeks before I decide to commit to settling down there. When I moved from Florida to New York, I was able to make enough connections to get a job relatively easy. When I moved from New York to Chicago, it was not so lucky. So I settled and landed a job within about a month of my move and stayed at that job for the whole duration of my stay in Chicago. I enjoyed the city for a very long time. I've spent almost two years in Chicago and during that time I had built up a very solid bond between myself, the work I did, and the people I worked with. When I left Chicago, I did so under very stressful circumstances. I had made it clear to my manager that I was leaving for a new city and when I went to quit, she didn't care and wouldn't let me leave! I left and left for another city at the same company because I was too loyal to just quit without giving a two weeks' notice. I felt like it was the right thing to do. I left and moved",

    "Hello everyone. I have what I believe to be kundalini going on and I was hoping to get some insight here...\nThe first time I had 'feelings for want of a better word' was around 8 years ago. I didn't really get anything out of it but one day while sitting at my computer a sense of panic started to come. It got so strong that I had to get myself to a very nice looking home in my neighborhood and tell the host that I needed to be taken care of because I was going insane. I was taken care of and left for the evening. That was the last time I felt any 'feeling' like that in my life till last week...\nAt first, I thought I had something stuck in my throat. The feeling was intense but the more I would try to talk the more it felt like there was something there. I started to get a little concerned. By the next day I went to the ER. After many tests and even more concerned face expressions from the ER staff they concluded there was nothing wrong but my throat was very tense and possibly had some constriction. They even tried to do a 'throat dilation'. They gave me a local and tried to open my 'tense throat' but couldn't. Eventually they decided to send me home and tell me I have GERD and some possible tension in my jaw muscles. I was told to go home, eat a bland diet, take some meds for my stomach and jaw and see the ENT if it doesn't clear up.\nI'm not sure how long the problem lasted but it eventually went away and I never felt that intense feeling ever again or anything remotely like it since then.\nFast forward to about 4 months ago...

I know a lot of women find my mother attractive and that she herself is attractive, i do worry for how I can love a woman when i can't even love my parent.]\nI think that there are two different things going on here...\n(1) You are probably ashamed or uncomfortable with your own feelings, as I think a lot of men are - I can relate (though I will share my own experiences), AND\n(2) You have a legitimate concern about whether you can have a relationship with a woman because your mother doesn't fit your standards of attractiveness - if this is at all the case I will not be able to help you, because I am not a woman and I cannot speak for all women - but regardless it is certainly better to be upfront about your situation and work through your issues with your mother than to be dishonest.

It's made of steel.\n\nSo a storm comes up--which, incidentally, it has every right to call \"extremely violent and sudden\".  The ship is wallowing, it's heaving about pretty heavily.  It's also getting the \"very heavy wind and waves\" of the news report.  There's the threat that it's going to be driven out to the lake, where it can be hammered as it wallows and rolls even more easily.\n\nSo, faced with these two threats, you've got to get it under some kind of control.  The usual way to do this is to reduce the amount of cargo--take some of the ore out.  Even a huge ship, like the edmond fitzgerald is, is really a very efficient design for a huge, fast bulk carrier.  When you overload it, the extra weight doesn't just slow the ship down--it slows the ship down *a lot*, and puts a lot of pressure on things like the keel (which helps keep the ship from wallowing, but if the waves and wind are bad enough, won't).  It becomes sluggish.  You really want to get the weight down as quickly as possible unless you're sitting out on a calm lake in a huge storm.\n\nSo here's the thing--the edmond fitzgerald was over",

    "The \"Orioles\" were a Puerto Rican street gang active in the South Bronx area of New York City in the early 1980s. The Orioles were based in three tenements — the Orchard, the Vanguard and the Castle — and were the largest Puerto Rican gang in the Bronx with at least 1,100 members in the mid-1970s. They ruled over the neighboring territories of the \"Bishops\", \"Drifters\" and \"Tigers\". This was a brief period of time until the gangs were violently absorbed, one by one, by another organization, which started a more organized style of territorial warfare.\n\nThe new gang, later to become known as \"The Ghetto Brothers\", which had around 15 members in 1976 and was headed by Angel \"Keith\" Hernandez, began by organizing a fight tournament known as the \"King of the Hill\", in an attempt to gain recognition from the other street gangs in the area.\n\nIn one of these fight tournaments, which was held around 1976 or 1977, on a local park, about 50 members of the Orioles fought with 40 members of the Bronx Pinstripe gang. The Pinstripes and Bishops were affiliated with each other and it is believed that the Orioles were affiliated with the \"Tigers\", who later went on to form the notorious Mau Mau gang, the most feared, not only Latino gang in the Bronx, but the entire New York City area. Other gangs, such as the \"Rangers\", \"Kings\" and others also were eventually absorbed by the Ghetto Brothers, which thus came to be known as the \"Bronx Ghetto Brothers\", or \"BGBs\", for the sake of clarity.\n\nAngel Hernandez led the Ghetto Brothers to gain control of three major New York projects during the 1980s—the Castle Hill Projects, the Orchard Houses and the Vanguard Houses. The Ghetto Brothers gained complete control of the South Bronx.\n\nIn addition, the gang was involved in large-scale criminal activities that included drug trafficking, bank robbery and homicide. Most of the gang's activity took place in the South Bronx area around the Castle Hill Projects.\n\nThe police cracked down on the Oreos, which soon folded and their members went into hiding.

    "So i installed my Fujitsu ductless heatpump today but the unit is loud like i am sitting in a jet airliner. I am on the 8th floor. I have seen some posts elsewhere about it but this is really loud and almost deafening. Can i make it any quieter than it is right now? Maybe the unit needs recharging? It doesn't feel cold inside. Is it possible that the unit itself is defective? What else can i look at?\nWe all know how loud a mini split heat pump can be. I know at first, I thought I would need earplugs. You might want to check some other forums to see if your heat pump is running correctly. They can make a lot of noise. If they are too quiet, I would return them and get another set. This is usually a sign that something is up and you are not getting the full benefit of the heat pump. There are some things that you can do to make your pump quiet. The most common method is to make sure the fan is set to run at high speed. You should also make sure that the compressor is turned off. If you do not do this, your pump will run at full speed all the time.\nIf you are still experiencing loud noise from your pump, it could be because it is not running correctly or correctly. This is a common problem for people who are new to heat pumps. You should keep track of the temperature of your home, check the thermostat to make sure that it is set correctly, and make sure that the fan is set to on. Also, make sure that the heat pump is turned on correctly. Sometimes it is turned off completely, which causes the unit to run at full speed.\nThis is a great question to ask and I would be happy to answer it. I have three Fujitsu heat pumps in my home. The last one was installed last year, the previous one was a year ago and the first one was about 5 years ago. The last two were installed because I thought they worked better than my previous heat pump. My wife and I were happy with our Fujitsu heat pumps and never had any noise issues with them until a few months ago. I went to the Fujitsu forum to look for answers to our problem and I saw this post. The first two posters said that the Fujitsu heat pumps are loud. The third",
    "I'm 20 and a student and one of the most important goals I have for my future is to be the best parent I can be to my kids. However, when I was younger, a couple of years ago to be specific, I found out some family members had gotten in touch with the person who sold my dad 'ludes years ago. Because of his experiences with 'ludes, they got my dad in touch with a supplier and he's been doing 'ludes and sometimes other shit since the middle of his 30s, well into his 40s.\n\nHe's not a heavy user. He's just an easy target with money and he has no willpower. He has always tried to justify this by claiming that 'ludes never made him do anything he didn't want to do. To an extent, that's true, because when he does 'ludes he feels like he can control everything around him, so in some cases it actually helps him overcome his anxiety. However, when he comes off 'ludes, he often feels sad and worthless because he feels he has no control over his environment, so he'll just take some more and feel in control again. Also, he's been prescribed medication to take for his nerves and depression but never takes it. He says 'ludes make him feel better than any pill ever could so he would rather stick with that.\n\nWhen I was around 16, I started taking a drug called ketamine (kek/special K/vitamin k/pink candy). It didn't take much to seduce me. It was legal, cheap, a party drug, and people said that it really wasn't that bad. I'm not going to defend it, I hate the feeling it gives and I just see it as a gateway into taking much more harmful drugs; however, it was what it was and in that time around 16, that was the drug of the crowd I was in. The thing was, almost everyone I knew was either doing ketamine or weed, or both. I was a part of this crowd, but I never really got deeply involved until two years ago when I started doing coke and drinking a fair amount more than I do now. I was in a bad place. At college, I became involved with a very dangerous crowd and I would be up for days doing coke, drinking, doing ket",

I had only just learned the word \"Republican\", which is probably where I first heard the word \"multi-party system\".\n\nI believe I read that China had one-party democratic Communist system, and that the party invited people to participate in the system, and that it's the only party. I still remember reading about this at work in a book about how China's economy was doing well in the early 00's. \"The Chinese Communist Party has learned how to manage a capitalist economy\" is the basic gist of the chapter I read about that time.\n\nI learned about things like \"democracy\", \"Republic\", \"constitution\", \"multiparty\" and other political word systems while I was an intern at a local law firm. I learned at that time that the Republic in a single-party state was really just the name of the political party, and that \"Republic\" was not the same thing as \"Democracy\".\n\nAfter doing some self study about politics, I figured out that a system where people vote and decide things is not a \"Republic\", and that a system where the government is run by just one political party is actually called a \"dictatorship\".\n\nAs I read",

    "> The internet is all about getting as many \"upvotes\" (approvals) and \"comments\" as possible. Reddit has just introduced subscription-based upvoting as part of its revamp for redditgifts and reddit.com. Subscription-based upvoting allows users to pay to give someone upvotes and comments, with all the revenue going to the original author. This seems to violate the spirit of social networking if not the letter of the law. This post asks reddit users to boycott the new feature and take their money elsewhere.\r\r\n\r\r\n> Why this is problematic:\r\r- Upvoting does absolutely nothing. It is a meaningless activity. Users will have to be paying to waste their money. There is no point in upvoting and getting upvoted as we now do because they are all unpaid. I would give an example, but I'm afraid I would embarrass myself.\r- Subscription-based upvoting is a complete violation of the spirit of sharing information on the internet. It is simply a way for reddit to squeeze more money out of its users. Subscription-based upvoting goes against reddit's core philosophy. I don't want to see a bunch of people posting articles for one month and then disappearing without any pay or recognition. I understand that reddit is a for-profit company, but it is still a social networking site. It should not be using its users' personal data in any way that could potentially harm them or their reputations.\r- Reducing the number of users who use reddit.com.

    "I was at a local park, playing with my niece (3 yrs.). She loves to climb the climbing wall and swing set.

She then yells at me and calls me names. It was then that my brother finally steps in. He makes her apologize to my niece about calling her a dumbass (I didn't even) and then tells my sister to leave and not come back. After I calmed down, I asked why my niece didn't just try to go down the slide and fall (not get hurt but just fall), and my brother said since she was acting stupid, it would have been better for her to just fall down the hole of the slide and get hurt, but it would have been her own damn fault. I said it's not fair if she does get hurt, since she's not the one being stupid and she can't control it by herself, and he says that no it's not fair, she's not doing anything wrong, I shouldn't have yelled at her, I don't let my niece climb the slide or climb anything in the play place, and I'm just a mean person that wants to get rid of my niece to get rid of my brother's family.

    "The first issue of the book is this: The lack of PoC representation in the game's promotional material. Now don't get me wrong, there's a reason for the game lacking PoC representation in it's promotional material (mainly due to copyright issues with the source material) but that's not my point. My point is this: the book is a great start for any game master wanting to run the books. The book has a very good collection of new monsters and magic items as well as tons of great ideas for adventures and ideas for expanding your game world. Now that being said, the game has no PoC content. That I can't accept in my games. I would never, in good conscience, allow my friends of color to play this game without adding my own flavor. (My games are no where near as well put together as Chris Perkins's)\nHere is what I propose. The game master of the game (Chris Perkins) should add more PoC representation in the form of more monsters, magic items, and of course, more PoC player character options. It would be great if there were more PoC backgrounds for players and more races for player characters. I think that Chris and the company should add a PoC supplement as a supplement to the book. I'll be honest, at first I was thinking about creating my own PoC supplement for the game myself as well as a more in depth book of just PoC monsters, items, and characters, but I don't have the time to be working on any more of my other projects (for those of you who don't know, I've started writing a book about a PoC wizard's journey). But I'm a firm believer in collaboration and want to see Chris succeed in making his own game. As such, I'm here suggesting my ideas instead of going off and making my own.\nNow what you're thinking is, there's no PoC representation in the source material. That's true, but there's also no PoC representation in the book. I know what you're thinking. The game is based on a Tolkien model (though I personally believe that DnD is modeled more after the World of Greyhawk's gaming style) and it was based off of British fantasy. So then what? We can't have the game be a fantasy role playing game and",

    "I'm 25 and I'm a struggling student.\nLast September when I was 23 I moved away from my family and friends, and got a job as a care worker for children with Autism. I was doing well, but I decided I wanted to better myself, so I enrolled at my local university to study social work. I didn't have a lot of money, so I made a budget, a meal plan, and kept a weekly shopping list to ensure I was getting all the food I needed in a week. I did really well right up until the holidays. I don't know what happened I got out of the routine so I got stressed, and forgot that I'd already planned my meals. I just started buying whatever I felt like eating at dinner, got lazy with my lunches, and started snacking. As a result of my laziness throughout November and December my weight started to skyrocket and my energy levels hit the roof. I was waking up at 6am, and didn't eat until 6pm. I was exhausted.\nThen on top of that, I'm also a bit on the crazy side, so I started experimenting with dieting. I made an oatmeal smoothie, and a salad for lunch, and decided to give myself 2 cheat meals per week, but this didn't help. So one day, I decided to start over. I got rid of all my snacks and decided I wouldn't buy any fruit until I'd eaten my full lunch and dinner, and I felt really good. I started sleeping through to 5pm and having lots more energy.\nUnfortunately, I had no money to buy a new weighing scales (I had broken my old ones), so I started feeling really stressed out that I couldn't weigh myself and my weight plateaued for months but I continued to eat well. Then one day a got the scales, and I couldn't believe it, I had lost 14lbs! I had no idea how I'd done it. I started monitoring my eating again and now my weekly grocery shop comes to £50 rather than £80. I decided to go back on my meal plan for dinner. I used to start cooking at 3pm so that it was ready when I got home from work, but now I eat at around 645 so it's not a huge problem. I made some spaghetti bolognese last night and",

    "What we need right now is a few hundred of the latest and greatest Bradley fighting vehicle (Armored Personnel Carrier) that can be armed with various weapons (ATGM, TOW-A, 120mm M256 Mortar, etc).\nThe Bradley is known for its mobility, but it can also do infantry support with its 25mm Bushmaster cannon. This gives the Bradley the mobility that we need with the firepower equivalent of a Tank.\nThis would also not be a bad replacement for the Stryker (I could go on and on about how the Stryker is a waste of money), but the main use of the Bradley would be to patrol key routes like main roads and highways that lead to key areas of interest (like cities).\nThere are many great advantages to the Bradley:\nThe Bradley can hold up to 6 crew members and 9 (11 in the later models) fully equipped troops, this alone makes it an ideal platoon vehicle.\nThe crew and passengers are protected by heavy armor and can take fire from.50 cal and many types of AP rounds.\nThey can be quickly deployed to key areas of interest or to help out in the fight if necessary.\nThe Bradley can be used to escort vehicles and infantry to key areas, making sure they get where they need to be safely without being ambushed by the enemy or IEDs.\nThe Bradley can be used to transport supplies between areas making sure to transport all the necessary supplies to key areas.\nThe Bradley could act as a mobile command post from which leaders can direct forces with an overview of the situation.\nWhen not used in urban areas, the Bradley can be used to escort convoys along dangerous routes. The Bradley is a perfect fit for this and in a conflict like Iraq where IED’s are the name of the game it is a good idea to escort convoys, especially when it comes to medical and humanitarian convoys, they can even help search for missing civilians.\nThe Bradley has an excellent gunner in the turret who can engage enemy units on the move. This makes the Bradley a deadly foe in the defense which can be used as a guard unit defending key area and can engage enemy units that enter in the area of responsibility. The same is the case in attack, the Bradley can be used to lead the attack, helping the",
    "Today marks the first anniversary of the day I kicked smoking.\nTo be honest, on that day I remember sitting by a window at home and reading this website for an hour or so, trying to find a reason not to give it a try. But that day was the day I said \"enough\".\nMy last one was a week ago - I have a cold and I thought a cigarette would help. I even spent a few hundred RON buying a cheap brand, trying to get over my psychological barrier in trying it out for the first time.\nFor whatever it's worth, it didn't do the trick.\n[url]http://imgur.com/fFxQOoF[/url]\nEdit: if I could go back one year and give this post to some of the old me's in retrospect, I would probably say:\n\"hey man, remember the day you decided to quit smoking? That was pretty cool...you're gonna remember this in five years, when you think of it, you'll smile. You will also remember some of the days you managed to not smoke for the next couple of years, because some of those days were pretty good too...but in the meantime, the important thing is to make tomorrow a Non-Smoking Day!\"\nI have not had a single cigarette since then and I remember each and every day without a cigarette since then as a \"good day\". I don't think we ever really expect to see the date of the first day of non smoking, but on the other hand, we all know how important the first few days are, and if you want to quit and think I can give you some tips, just hit me.\nSo, I guess this is it for now.

    "I had been dating this guy for a little over a year (we're 22), it started off really well. We were texting everyday and he would make plans to come hangout with me but it seemed the more we dated the less he cared, but i had given up on him. We were supposed to hangout the next morning, i had been waiting for hours, and i started getting more and more worried. He didn't text to tell me how long it would take for him to get here or if he was still coming so i just told him i was going home, he texted me 5 hours later saying he would come visit me the next day but he cancelled (he was going to stay with his girlfriend who lived 30 min. away and he didn't want to be late/sleep on my couch). The next week he cancelled plans and i got so mad about it that i cut off ties with him, i ignored him for almost 2 weeks and this past weekend he texted saying we should hangout so i agreed to lunch on monday.\n\nHe says how nice it was to see me, that it'd been too long and how he missed me and missed talking to me, he says he would drive to my work the next day, i tell him that i would be working at a different store and my shift is the same and he says don't worry he'll just wait for me to get off. He sends me a text message that says he's at the store now. I check the time of the message, its been 1 and a half hours since the original message with out a single update as to where he is, i ask why he never updated me, he replied saying that he didn't know how to message from his phone. My manager texts me asking if i can clock out early because my shift was over and he was there, so i text him and say that now that i was able to work with my schedules time change and leave early i would wait for him. After some of the longest 10-15 mins of my life he texts me saying that he lost my number (even though we text everyday for the past 6 months) and that he could see my work from the parking lot and he was going to try and find what store i was at.

    "The last four years have been a journey I have taken almost exclusively alone. My social circle of friends from college have all been moving on with their lives, and there haven't been that many opportunities for me to forge new relationships. This last year I moved to a new city and was trying to meet people, when COVID struck, wiping all opportunities for me to create a new life for myself. I didn't have any friends or connections in this new city, and my new job didn't allow for a single person in your life.\n\nAfter a few months of struggling to find meaning, purpose, and connection, my loneliness became nearly intolerable. I felt very isolated and alone. There were plenty of moments when I cried just from the emptiness. I knew then that I needed to do something. I had reached my limit and reached out for help. In my moment of desperation, I did what perhaps I never would have done before... I joined reddit.\n\nHere was a space where I could voice my emotions and thoughts openly. I knew that these thoughts were not unique and that somewhere on the internet, there was someone with some of the same questions and doubts. I knew then that I must not be the only one searching for community. And perhaps in sharing my story, others would feel less alone and share their own.\n\nThe first post I made on reddit was a simple plea for others to share their stories, their struggles, and their triumphs. That is how I met my first friend. A man in China who had also moved cities, was living with his girlfriend and had gotten laid off from his job. We started exchanging messages. I was able to ask him about his life, to learn about the places he lived. We did not meet in person until much later, but he became one of the most important people I have met in the past few years.\n\nSince then we have been in constant contact. Despite not having any time, I do not know how to convey the amount of gratitude I have for him and the community that gave me a sense of purpose and connection.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, I decided to create a community to empower myself and others to reach happiness and fulfillment through connection. That is how A Common Mission was born. I have reached out to people all over the world for help in building the community and spreading it around me.",
    "Hey there, I'm in need of a lot of suggestions and ideas!\nI have a 3 year old border collie that's been very anxious. I've always thought it was mainly caused by boarding her and not being able to be home when she was young, but it seems to be getting a lot worse especially with grooming. My husband and I both groom her. When I try I'm able to get her through a brush, a nail trim, but when it comes to baths and shaving, it turns into a fight. She will run, howl and growl at me to leave her alone. When my husband tries to bathe her, she'll jump out of the tub and just keep running. She's gotten to the point of me where she'll run in fear, howl and hide and stay hidden for the rest of the day. My husband has no success with her, even when it just comes to brushing her teeth or trimming nails. It's gotten to a point where she'll just start crying when she sees anyone with scissors. My husband even had the vet remove her spurs on both nails so she won't grow so quick, but I still haven't seen an improvement.

    "\"I'm here to warn you all of what I've been going through this week—which, in all honestly, I still can't wrap my mind around.\nI'm a former professional gamer, and while I had been semi-retired since last March 2020, I still follow the various events in the scene. I first went to Worlds back in 2011 when my team, Team SoloMid, got second place. I went to Worlds 2 years ago, and it really felt like a different tournament. There wasn't much hype to begin with since I'd imagine all of them have felt boring, and this year, I was very curious to see how it was going to turn out.\nI got the idea to go back when Team Liquid were upset to qualify, and I saw many people on Twitter and Reddit say how they were going to go and support them. Of course, these are all people that have no real connection with TL. But, I'm a little more unique and I did have an \"in\" with members of the team so I got tickets to the LA Finals and went down to watch them play.\nThe tournament was a blast and there were tons of people attending it from all kinds of places around the world. For me, it felt like getting a piece of my old life back and I had a great time. However, things felt a little… off from the moment I first bought my ticket and got into there.\nI walked into this place called the Microsoft Theater with my sister a few hours before the first game against Korea. As we walked into this big hallway, I was looking around and I noticed that one wall had pictures from both the 2019 Worlds in Korea and 2021 Worlds in Italy. I remember taking a look towards the wall and I noticed that the Korean team, T1, had their picture with the trophy at the 2019 event, while Team Liquid had nothing. I was a little surprised since it seemed they should rightfully have a picture on this wall, since they were on the opposite side of it, and I said this to my sister. As we walked in farther into the main concourse of the building, we saw that Team Liquid had their own room—and that room had nothing in it either to indicate they had won at the Finals in Korea. Not a sign, not even a picture.\nAs we approached the main doors of the room",

    "\"My wife is from Vietnam. So am I. Her whole family (moms side of the family) is from Vietnam. I was born abroad, so my views on things are a bit different than say Vietnam's.\nThis is an article about a 14 year old girl in Vietnam. She is \"studying\" for a medical degree at age 14. It's very common in Vietnam to have 14 year old girls studying medical degrees. Because of all these girls studying medical degrees instead of living their childhood, being a doctor is losing it's prestige in Vietnam.\nThis is another article about the same girl, but it gives you another perspective about what's going on in Vietnam.\nYou can replace \"girls studying medical degrees\" with \"boys not allowed to study\" in this article.\nIt's a hard balance between keeping your cultural values and yet living in a modern world. But Vietnam has done an amazing job of keeping its traditions and yet modernizing. Take a look at this article about this Vietnamese village.\nA lot of this has to do with the family structure. In Vietnam, the parents are the authority figures. Kids still respect that. So they still have a chance at family life. My wife had the first child (in the village) when she was 15. Because my mother in law had a medical degree, she could have become a professional in Vietnam. But she chose not to, in order to take care of the family. So there's still a balance.\nNow in our family, my wife has decided that she wanted to finish her PhD and become a researcher at a university. So we moved our family to the United States so she can work on her PhD. When my wife does well for herself, then she's not going to worry too much about her family and can focus on her family life. And because my father and mother in law have all these degrees, that's not what my kids are going to be focusing on.\nI was thinking back on this post. When I went out of country to graduate school, my mother in law basically told my wife to \"go go go with your family\". This is like having to watch \"The Princess Diaries\" and \"The Iron Lady\" in real life and it was something I couldn't imagine ever happening to us.\nOne time we went back to visit",
    "The guy made something better, it's as simple, and as complicated as that.\n\nWalker's name may have been dropped (or was it added?) into Google code, but he wasn't the only one involved in the software package, which was a project called \"Google Sightseeing.\"\n\nSightseeing was an open source project with a goal of creating a \"Google Earth\" type of application for the Linux platform. The project was started by some guys at Google (obviously) but eventually a fork emerged, and the Sightseeing project took on a life of its own.\n\nSightseeing ended up offering features not found in Google Earth. It could do things like load in your own pictures and maps, including 3rd party imagery, such as NASA satellite maps and maps from Mapquest and Google Maps themselves.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Sightseeing application was open source, so many people contributed to its development. Eventually, an entirely new fork of the application, known as \"WorldWind,\" was created. In fact, WorldWind ended up being so successful that it was ported to Windows as well, by a guy named John Walker.\n\nOne thing that's a little puzzling is why a version of the WorldWind application ported to Windows came from two separate people; one port came from a guy named Adam, the other was made by John Walker. In my opinion, both are excellent applications in and of themselves.\n\nThe point here is that WorldWind is a pretty damn good application, and it made Google Earth look like second place in just about every category. After a while it looked like WorldWind was starting to catch on quite a bit too. Then, in July of 2007, John Walker suddenly appeared out of nowhere, a.k.a. \"Google Guy,\" and started making a bunch of post in an unrelated Google Blog.\n\nWhat we could never predict was the bombshell that John had in store: the announcement of his Google Earth alternative. It became pretty clear that Google had given him this project to work on as a side job, similar to the way Google funded the Sightseeing project.\n\nThe first versions of the software were pretty shoddy. In fact I remember writing John an email asking him about the project, and he admitted that the release at the time wasn't very good, and",
    "Tell me there is hope for low testosterone...\nI'm a 23 year old male currently undergoing testosterone replacement. I went in for an appointment a couple of weeks ago and had my blood drawn. The initial lab results showed that my total blood testosterone was just above the low-normal range at 11.2 ng/dL. This was confirmed by a blood test given a week prior. I am 6 feet tall and weigh approximately 200 lbs. I was instructed to increase my dosage by 50mg per week, which was done 4 days ago. If all goes well after a couple of weeks and my results remain unchanged, I will increase my dosage again by 50mg every two weeks for a total of 400mcg per week.\nA large reason I chose to go through this was to improve my workout results and my body composition. However, I have experienced absolutely no change in body fat, strength or endurance. I typically work out 6 days a week on an intense schedule. This is why I was somewhat skeptical when the doctor told me results take time.\nI understand that there are benefits to using hormones, such as being able to increase strength without bulking up. However, I just want to know if there is hope for me. I am currently trying to achieve a slim, muscular physique and am worried that after going through 6 months of injections and anabolic cycles and no result, I may never see any real results. I know many people have achieved a high testosterone level after going through replacement and have improved their physique. It doesn't seem to be working for me and I need a little hope.

The following weekend (3 weeks ago) I went on a backpacking trip (it was a day out/overnight trek) and was pretty ill with severe stomach cramps and diarrhoea. On top of that I had severe chest pains which I still experience daily. At the time I thought this was just due to the stress of the trip and that it would go.

    "Subreddit: /r/nosleep\nTitle: \"Swimming in lakes and rivers is WAY scarier/worse than the ocean\"\nSummary of Original Post\nAuthor: [reddit username: SnoopDizzle]\nDate of Original Post: June 21, 2020\nI grew up in a very rural part of the USA that is surrounded by many very large lakes and rivers. I spent a great deal of time swimming, and canoeing, and floating in tubes, in those lakes and rivers, when I was growing up. It is not a stretch whatsoever when I say that I have more first-hand and real knowledge of lakes and rivers in the summer, than anyone I have ever met in my entire life knows of the ocean. They are VERY different places. They are also far more dangerous than oceans. The people commenting in this post, who have never done this and do not believe me, will not believe me here. I suggest going somewhere where you can observe this first hand. (I am not a sales person or anything like that). I am just a person who has been swimming in lakes and rivers since they could swim, and does not mind discussing their experience. (Ages range from 8 to almost 20)\nLakes and rivers are very dangerous in many ways. They can be very fast moving, and they can go for very long distances without being seen. In one instance, I was floating with my younger siblings (my brother and sister) at a point in a very, very large river where we could see the other side of the river, without the ability to see ourselves. While floating along talking, we were all facing the river and looking at it, rather than looking around ourselves. My brother and sister suddenly told me that they could see nothing in front of us, but felt as though something had just hit them in the face. As if someone had suddenly thrown a bucket of water into our faces. They could hear nothing, but they could feel something on their face. As I turned to look, something was coming towards us from the side of the river. I could see it as it came within feet of us. It was a very, very large, dark green shark. It was over 5 feet tall and 3+ feet wide. Not quite a Great White shark, but very tall and very wide,",

    "Aron Ralston's (James Franco) appreciation of nature turns to horror when a fallen branch traps him in a remote Utah canyon. Over the next five days, he exhausts every means to save himself. Running out of food and slowly losing hope, Ralston is forced to make a desperate choice.\nThe director, Danny Boyle, said he came up with the idea for the movie by listening to Aron Ralston's book, Between a Rock and a Hard Place. In a story that started to spread like wildfire on the news, Ralston went hiking alone in Blue John Canyon in 2003. Unfortunately, he fell while attempting to descend a steep part of the canyon.\nThe movie opens with Aron Ralston telling us a story. He starts by explaining that he's going to tell us the truth. So, the story is about Ralston telling that he was in a canyon on his own, but when he started climbing down, he fell and got stuck there. He explains to the camera that there are three ways of getting down the canyon. One is the way up, another is staying there, not moving at all, and the third is climbing directly down.\nHe attempts the second way, he explains that it did not work for him, and therefore he decided to choose the last way. As he was attempting to climb down the canyon, he managed to pass half of the way, and that's why he fell the other half and got stuck.\nHe also explains that there are two parts of the movie, the second part will be about how he is going to go out of this canyon. The second part of this movie will be how he is trying to get himself out of this canyon, he tells the camera. It will be about his own journey. After he gets there, he notices that there is a large rock in front of him. The camera then moves and he starts to tell us about the events as they happen. He is describing how he feels trapped in a place that he doesn't know.\nAron Ralston talks to the camera about how he feels like he doesn't have any other choice. He explains that he's afraid to be stuck in the canyon forever. He makes up his mind and starts to climb up while he's holding the phone, but he doesn't see the canyon.",

    "I just returned home from a long, yet enjoyable day at the movies. I first saw the \"Quantum of Solace\" movie at 3:40 this afternoon at the Mall of America here in Bloomington, Minnesota. I then returned to the theater an hour and 45 minutes later to see the movie again. My second viewing of the movie was at 5:40 p.m. It should be noted that I don't often see a movie that I like a second time, but the \"Quantum of Solace\" movie is simply exceptional. I have always been a big James Bond fan, and I also enjoy seeing a movie that is in keeping with the storyline that exists in an author's books. Such was the case with Ian Fleming's book \"Quantum of Solace,\" which also served as the basis for the \"Quantum of Solace\" movie.\nIan Fleming is my all-time favorite author, and this movie is very much in keeping with my image of James Bond. I am also very much in agreement with the casting choices made for the movie, especially Daniel Craig as James Bond. Daniel Craig has portrayed James Bond very well. I have a good deal of respect for the producers of the movie for having the good taste to include one of my favorite scenes from the book in the movie. (That scene was included in the earlier portion of the movie in the scene in which James Bond is in a gambling establishment.) I also liked the decision made to show James Bond as the hard-edged, no nonsense, tough-as-nails spy that Ian Fleming intended James Bond to be. Daniel Craig has successfully shown the tough-guy James Bond that Ian Fleming created in the book \"Quantum of Solace.\"\nWhile I really liked the \"Quantum of Solace\" movie, I did have one problem with it. That was my inability to understand the character, Camille, as being Italian. I believe that Camille was to be portrayed as an American in the movie rather than an Italian. I believe that I may know the actress, Olga Kurylenko, who played Camille in this movie. I met her in February of this year at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Film Festival. I was particularly impressed with Ms. Kurylenko when I met her because she was obviously fluent in not only her native Russian language but also in English. I don't know how much of",
    "\"I'm going to go on the record and say that 'Salt' is one of the best, and most enjoyable spy movies I have ever seen. This was a non-stop thrill ride from beginning to end, the story has a great flow, and it's packed with action and excitement. Every scene brings forth the next, you are never bored or disinterested; the movie is made quite well and has quite a bit of humor to it, as well. The acting was great across the board, as was the direction and the script. This movie is a movie about an action hero, but it is far more than a movie about an action hero. It is a movie that brings in that old school glamour that comes with this type of film genre, and at the same time, it is a movie that can and will hold your attention and make you really enjoy and care about the characters who have to deal with all of the problems and obstacles that come their way. The action is also superbly executed, there are some truly amazing stunts and action sequences in this movie, and a good part of it is because the movie has a ton of heart, both heart on a personal level, and heart on a professional level, and it is that heart that truly brings the movie to a high level. There are a few nitpick types here and there, and the ending is a bit rushed, but these are minuscule things that get in the way of an otherwise great movie.\"\n\"Salt\" opens nationally today in U.S. theaters.

    "From the moment this movie was announced everyone had the same question on their mind, “Who will play Luke Skywalker?” George Lucas had kept Mark Hamill on the fence for much of the movie and he kept us waiting until the last possible minute before announcing his decision on which actor would star as young Han Solo in Revenge of the Sith. Fans were equally curious when it came to who would play our young hero in Jedi. Many names were floated about the industry—including Kevin Costner and Billy Zane. One name that never really became an option was that of Charlie Sheen. The young actor had shot the lights out of his first two big roles, playing Joel Goodsen in Places in the Heart and Chris in Red Dawn.\nCharlie Sheen as Luke Skywalker\nNow don’t get me wrong, I don’t think Charlie Sheen would have been a bad Luke Skywalker—he had that charm and charisma that the part required and his youth at the time would have served to allow him to carry on with the character for two more sequels. In fact, most fans probably would not see the difference if Sheen had been cast in the role. The only problem with his casting was that at the time that Jedi was being made Sheen was on the verge of becoming America’s most popular young star—a position that Hamill had previously held before he got the role of Luke Skywalker. Even so, many would argue that given the state of Hamill’s career as Luke Skywalker came to a close, Sheen may have provided a better legacy behind him than the actor who did land the part.\nSheen’s career was in an ascendant stage when Jedi was being shot—he was the star of two successful feature films and had a big hit series in Happy Days. As a result, he was considered to be the hottest young star—the fact that he never actually got the part of Luke must have been tough, because he was being chased for the role of Han Solo. The decision to go with an unknown rather than Sheen or any of the other young stars of the day ultimately ended up giving Luke a more humble beginning—he was not immediately seen as having been discovered by the galaxy. By the time that Chewbacca was first seeking Luke in Tatooine, he was regarded as the least desirable",
    "I haven't seen such a bad movie since _Showgirls_. I hope you know what to expect because what you are about to see will be so atrocious you'll have to laugh. If you think Pauly Shore is bad in this one you've never seen his _Inconvenienced_ TV show.\n\nThis film will embarrass you to no end. It's the movie that defines the word \"terrible.\"\n\nIf you are ever offered a role in this movie just say no! You don't know who you are messing with! If the producers get upset with you and threaten to use their massive influence to make sure your career is over, just tell them to go ahead. You will be doing everyone involved in the movie a favor. Just look at what this movie did to the career of Gerry Hall. He's now remembered as the guy that played an Indian. But he is a good actor, he even gave a decent performance in _Dumb and Dumber_.\n\nIf you aren't laughing by the time the main title comes up you need to see a doctor. Because they will definitely be laughing on the other side of this screen. You can laugh with or at them. _Spice World_ is that funny. The opening scene is a musical number in a London subway station. You can't help but cringe when all of the Spice Girls start to sing and the Spice Babes (Spice Girls' lookalikes) jump out and start to dance with them.\n\nI don't know if they were joking or if they were trying to get revenge but I felt so bad for Mel B. and her terrible singing and terrible stage presence. The whole first 15 minutes was full of musical numbers and bad acting. I'm not surprised that the screenwriter of this movie directed Mel B.'s movie _Honey_. After seeing this movie I wonder how Mel B. could even act.\n\nBefore the movie starts you can see a few clips of the Spice Girls during their days on _Top of the Pops_. Boy do those songs sound cheesy now. In fact the whole movie is one big cheese ball. The movie goes back in forth in time. In one of the scenes you see the Spice Girls talking to their manager who says, \"I've created a girl group for the 90's.\" You gotta wonder how",
    "\"What is it that we hate so intensely in this film? Is it the sadism, the bestiality, the necrophilia, the ritual humiliation and mutilation of the bodies of two hundred young women or, perhaps, the endless perversions committed on them, both mentally and physically? Is it the moral degradation? Or maybe it is just the banality of it all. This is it: all that was done to those girls is just routine in our society. It is not the cruelty of the Nazis that's the most shocking - although the scene of mass rape by those soldiers, including the one (played by Giancarlo Giannini) that claims to be an art critic, certainly is one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen on film - but the utter indifference of the soldiers and the citizens of the town towards the pain, suffering and humiliation of other human beings. This indifference is what shocks us. It is the kind of casual sadism that we see every day around us, in society: it is not even the soldiers who take a more active part in the sadistic acts, but the policemen, the lawyers, the men of the town that only join for a bit, for a few minutes, while it is more interesting. \"\n\"The most difficult thing for most people to understand is that the film is not so much a celebration of sadism, but an invitation to think about the pervasiveness of sadism in our society, which is, as with fascism, a form of the politics of indifference, indifference which is not so much a lack of feeling as a refusal to acknowledge feelings, which are, as with the people portrayed in Salo, regarded as irrelevant, unnecessary and, ultimately the only thing that mattered in life, power.\"\nAnd from the San Francisco Bay Guardian review by Peter Hartlaub:\n\"Even though \"Salo\" was banned in Italy for a few years after its 1975 release, its images are as fresh in memory as yesterday's newspapers. At the same time, the film itself has been largely out of circulation, a victim of its own notoriety: no mainstream video distributor would touch it, even by accident. It is the true nature of the horror genre that many people have seen \"Salo\" without ever actually watching the film. People might be surprised to discover that this is",
    "\"When the film begins, it is the eve of Brooklynite Tony Manero (John Travolta)'s 18th birthday. He is an auto mechanic by day; by night he transforms into a dynamic disco dancer who struts his way to stardom at the legendary Paradise Garage in Manhattan. The trouble with Tony is, when not wearing his grease-covered coveralls he's wearing a satin suit and a boa. And when he is not dancing he is sitting in the front row of every Saturday Night Fever dance marathon, watching his idol, the handsome, cool, and aloof, yet sympathetic John Travolta strut his stuff on stage. When Tony's girlfriend Angela (Karen Lynn Gorney) suggests they move into a small apartment of their own, Tony, having more or less made up his mind to abandon Brooklyn and move to Manhattan, is reluctant till he notices in a picture in a newspaper a picture of himself on the front row at Fever; he has now made up his mind. And in the process he drops Angela, who has been the most steadfast member of his support group of friends -- Pino (Joseph Cali), Paulie (Dennis B. Farina), Joey (Barry Miller) and Mona (Brenda Vaccaro) -- who help him win his quest to become a \"Saturday Night Fever\" hotshot. But for the moment, Tony's only concern is his birthday party, and after getting wasted, and after singing a rendition of Paul McCartney's \"Maybe I'm Amazed,\" he wakes up in his apartment next morning and realizes that today is the big party and today is the party that his friends are throwing for him.\nHe has to dress up and go down to the disco. At that point he wakes up. He goes out and finds his friends, one in an armadillo costume, a second in a mummy costume, and even Paulie in an Afro wig, and the four of them go out to the party. They find that the party has been \"rescheduled\" with a new deejay, the \"sadistic\" (as he said of the disco) Mr. Stacy (Bobby Van). Tony proceeds to go up on stage to dance, but in doing so he does not really come into his own, that is,",
    "In I, Robot, there are elements that work: the special effects and design make up a unique and interesting future, and it is an interesting notion to ask \"What if machines did start getting rights and fighting back?;\" however, too many clunkers are sprinkled into the film, such a Will.I.Am or the \"Love, Baby\" song or the \"Carly\" robots, and overall the film has a dull feel to it throughout. This dullness is most likely due to the fact that there are no compelling characters in the movie. In fact, it is quite distracting and disappointing to watch as one of the main robot characters, Sonny, has almost no screen time whatsoever (with even his back story cut out entirely) in the film even though it was supposed to be his fight against humanity.

    "\"The Lost City of Z could be a great film, but instead is a rather lackluster period piece with a couple of good performances from Charlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson. The real problem with The Lost City of Z lies within the lack of any focus and the fact that it really has no idea what point it wants to make about the story it tells. The Lost City of Z doesn't so much attempt to tell a real story as it does to hit the bullet points. It's like reading a Wikipedia page. Nothing in the film moves; it's all exposition and it all seems to rush by you as you get confused trying to keep track of every character, back-story, location, and timeline.\nThe Lost City of Z at the end of the day is an average biopic because of the aforementioned reasons. Though I'm sure the real characters were real people, it's hard to tell them from one another when they're portrayed so badly on screen.\n\"The Lost City of Z\" is now playing in a few theaters in the South Bay, such as Century 20 Daly City.\nWhat is the movie rating?\nThis movie is rated R (for violence, adult content, some drug use and brief language).\nReview of documentary \"The Jihadists Next Door\"\nBy Jana J.

It's clear that he has internal conflicts and wants to follow his religious convictions.\nWe also learn about Jumaane Williams, a young man from the same community with the same religious convictions but from a different family and set of circumstances.\nWe follow the lives of these two young men until all the signs come together to show the trajectory they may follow.

    "Tells the story of a teenage girl, Sara (Julie Anne Haddock), who must balance her intense dancing training with everyday school life. When her parents are forced to move from their Chicago home to nearby Indiana after her father (Sean Patrick Thomas) takes a management job with a factory, Sara's life is suddenly turned upside down.\nIn preparation for her senior year, she applied to every performing-arts school within driving distance of where her parents ended up. Her top choice is University of North Carolina's (UNC's) School of the Arts (SOTA), one of the most competitive schools for dance in the United States. She gets notice that she was accepted at SOTA in October, but she is devastated when she must stay at her new school until the end of the semester. She is not the best student, so staying at school is not going to be that easy. What happens when she is torn between two places that her heart belongs to; a boy that she wants, and friends that she knows she will miss? Does Sara make the right decision?\nThis movie is based upon a true story about a dancer who had to make a very hard move to move and move into a new school. She could not help but look back at all the friends she had already made at her old school. She did not have her dance school for her to go and practice at when she left. She missed her old school and her old friends; she felt depressed about moving at first, she felt so bad that she was tempted to run back to her old school.\nThen, Sara realized that to make her dream happen, she had to work and make friends. That is something she did not want to do, but she realized it would be the only way to get to her dream of dancing for UNC. Then she thought, why does this matter to her? Sara did not want to get this upset about moving, but she realized that it was all that mattered to her at the time.\nThe cast for \"Save the Last Dance\" includes Sean Patrick Thomas, Julia Stiles, and Fredro Starr. \"Save the Last Dance\" is a feel good movie with a strong message.

    "You’d think director Stephen Frears had gone to the same university as Peter Morgan. When Mr. Morgan wrote the screenplay for \"The Deal\", it was full of characters (and lines) that parodied Tony Blair. Mr. Morgan’s previous project, \"The Deal\", was also about Margaret Thatcher, and had the prime minister in the role of parody for almost every character except Maggie Thatcher herself. Then, at the end of the movie, his hero, a fictional British Prime minister named Michael Wolpert (Geraldine James) goes after a Conservative cabinet member and shouts: \"And if he dares to call me a Tory again, I’ll make a Labourist out of him!\" If Blair had been even half the politician Thatcher was, or even half as willing to act on principle, he could have pulled a similar trick. But he couldn’t – he’ll go down in history as a vacillating vacuous toad.\nOf course, the movie that \"The Deal\" was based on, \"The Queen\", could go nowhere near the reality of what really happened at the time. To begin with, the prime minister (Helen Mirren) actually has a backbone - she isn’t a political ninny. And the entire cabinet doesn’t end up plotting against her. Morgan also had to deal with some of the same facts he wrote about in the script for \"The Deal\": the Queen was in Scotland the day the news broke about Princess Diana’s death, and while Blair didn’t call a special emergency cabinet meeting out of paranoia (he was right to doubt the intelligence report), he did take a lot of the political fall-out on his shoulders. The queen and Thatcher did not talk to each other when the two met at Balmoral, and Thatcher later told her daughter-in-law: \"That Blair! The only thing he understands is polls\" (which is true - at least of New Labour; the Blair of the old Labour Party understood principles).\nBut we can’t really complain about how much of the movie was fiction - Morgan still used real historical events, real people (or the actual voice of Princess Diana) and (more importantly) real dialogue. What’s irritating about the movie is that it falls into a common trap for Morgan: it starts out realistic,",
    "\"Final Destination 2\" was a good sequel compared to what \"Halloween H2O\" did to the original \"Halloween\" that came five years before it. That movie was so bad, the studio should have let it die right there.\nThere was nothing original in this sequel. Not like the original. The original had you guessing like there was a twist within the twist. This one played it safe, and left no mystery to be guessed. Also, the special effects were no better than the first. Just as bloody and violent, but still mediocre.\nIt's unfortunate that most sequels today, just repeat all of the same situations and plot lines that were in the first one. \"Final Destination,\" didn't have a happy ending. So, there can't be a sequel if all of the characters are gone too.\nWe can only hope that the next installment will be better than this one!\nI like Final Destination better than Final Destination 2. I think that Final Destination 2 doesn't have as good story, even though the cast is better. Final Destination is more dramatic.\nThe two of them have the same type of music. My favourite songs are the \"The Beginning\" and the \"Death\" songs. However, \"The Beginning\" song reminds me of the \"Beautiful\" song in Final Destination. It is about the final day that was recorded, and \"The Beginning\" was \"Final Destination\".\nI rate Final Destination 3 (4 if you count the prequels) 6 million out of 10. And I rate Final Destination 2 2 and a half million out of 10. And Final Destination I rate 2 and a half million out of 10.\nHere's the plot summary from IMDb.com:\n\"Final Destination is a series of films which began in 2000.

    "Saving Mr. Banks is a beautiful movie, well acted and with a marvelous story. It is easy to see why this movie was nominated for multiple awards, including Academy Awards for Best Actress (Tom Hanks) in a Supporting Role (as Walt Disney) (2013) and Best Original Score (2013). It is a wonderful story which portrays the history of Mary Poppins' creation as a character, and as a film. Mary Poppins was a movie that Walt Disney personally believed should have a happy ending even in a very tough time for a lot of people in the country.\n\nWe have a good bit of the film shown, and then we have some historical information about the film, Mary Poppins itself, and what the book did for Walt Disney as a child. Tom Hanks is an excellent actor, and gives us a Walt Disney that shows the personal side of the person who brought Mary Poppins to life, and also brought many of our favorite movies that we all enjoy to us on the big screen.\n\nThe scenes with P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) and her character (played brilliantly by Emma Thompson) help us to understand the history of the book. Emma Thompson had a wonderful scene which showed how she used her character, Miss Poppins, as a way to stay tough and not let life break her spirit. She kept the toughness in her writing, and made her character show a tough spirit through her words.\n\nThe film also shows the history of the writing of the book Mary Poppins. P. L. Travers was tough, but she also was a little child like, which Tom Hanks showed by using Disney's own words. The movie showed why this film was made in the way that it was shown, and with the happy ending, rather than the end that P. L. Travers wrote for. There were two different versions to the film, and we see one of the versions presented in the movie. A very nice, touching scene is shown at the end of the movie when Walt Disney presents the statue of P. L. Travers as Mary Poppins.\n\nTom Hanks gives an excellent performance as Walt Disney. It helps that Walt Disney is a true-life person, and Tom Hanks gets a lot of Disney's nuances and mannerisms.",
    "On Sunday, December 7th of 1941, the Japanese military air force executed a surprise attack on the USA Navy at Pearl Harbor, Oahu.\nThis movie shows this attack with such a great precision that if this movie isn't based solely on real events, my name isn't Bill Gates.\nI'm no History buff, but this is the best movie I've ever seen on historical events. I went to the movie theater totally skeptical, I've heard that certain people were up in arms about the movie portraying the Japanese as the bad guys, but after seeing it I can honestly say that the movie does portray those events as accurately as possible.\nThis is not a \"Black & White\" movie, the Japanese as portrayed in this movie were not one-dimensional characters, the fact is that it's a very intricate story and the only way to tell this complicated tale was to show the humanity of both sides. Yes, the Japanese were indeed our enemy during WWII, yes we fought them all the way to unconditional surrender and yes there are many ugly actions that our government has done towards the Japanese during and after WWII, but not all Japanese were monsters, they were people, with families, dreams, etc, and I think the movie shows all that very well.\nAs for the movie itself, the story was very complex, the directing was great, the cinematography was beautiful, in fact I had to keep in mind that these events actually took place. The special effects were phenomenal, some of the scenes were so powerful that they literally had me on the edge of my seat, and it made my skin crawl. The acting was, in my opinion, spot on. All the main players did a wonderful job, Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale were magnificent as the young Army airmen and Jim and Dora (Joseph Giamatti & Cuba Gooding Jr) were just as good! As for the supporting roles, Alec Baldwin was great as the overworked and stressed Army General, David Duchovny (Jack D. Ripper?) was superb as the military attaché to the Japanese embassy and Jon Voigt (the father from Anaconda) was very believable as the war correspondent.\nThe movie is a little bit long (almost 2 1/2 hours) but it's so worth it. This is definitely a movie that should be",

The young girls are enchanted by their forest playmate, but a visit to their paternal grandmother introduces them to the scary and alluring world of the Catbus. Will they ever see their father again?\n\nMiyazaki's best-ever film has one of his most touching, human stories, and it's just as good the third time as it was the first. Totoro himself is the nicest, most sympathetic creature you could imagine, though all the characters are wonderfully detailed. The girls are perfectly drawn; Satsuki is a sweet, strong, self-reliant eight-year-old, and she never loses her sense of fun or of the importance of her family.\n\nThe world of Totoro is also full of enchantment - a strange, delightful world in which a forest is haunted by a village of \"susuwatari,\" magical creatures made of bamboo. Miyazaki's creatures always have a great deal of personality, and each one is given a brief moment in the spotlight: even Chihiro's greedy mother gets her chance to shine. The cat and his bus (a strange combination of characters and ideas) are especially good. The backgrounds and the countryside are spectacular, from the Japanese scenery to Soot spouts in the factory town. (Of course, with Miyazaki there are no clunking \"modern\" sequences of TV and department stores.)\n\nThe film is also a joy to watch purely for its visual style.",

    "One of Akira Kurosawa's most extraordinary accomplishments that the Academy failed to recognize when awarding him an Oscar for his legendary DREAMS (1990) is this powerful, breathtakingly visual, and yet hauntingly moving story of an aging warlord (Akira Terao), torn by conflict and unable to retire gracefully or peacefully. Kurosawa's film is an astute study of the Japanese psyche - its ability to maintain a fierce pride in spite of humiliation and loss - and a masterful example of cinematic storytelling and directing that few films by him or anyone else can match. His camera moves in and out of his characters with astonishing ease. And the sets - the sets! He and his crew produced one of the most amazing works of art, from the tiniest details to the vistas that appear beyond the horizon. It's simply breathtaking and beyond description. My only gripe, the one that cost him an Oscar, is that he uses the \"voice of god\" narration to relate his story. He's telling the events before and after they happen. It works beautifully, but his film was cut down in length in the U.S. when it was released, so he included his narration to fill in some of the gaps. It might not have detracted from your appreciation of the story if you saw this one-hundred minute uncut form. This film, to me, ranks right up there among the masterworks of Akira Kurosawa. Not only does it tell a gripping and poignant story, but it gives us a rich look into a world that exists only in his magnificent vision. Kudos also to his remarkable actors, for their performances were as superb as the settings. If you haven't seen this one, it should be near the top of your list of films to watch and revel in.

    "\"Become a star, but lie! That's the moral of this funny comedy. It would have helped if Jim Carrey had stayed in character for the entire time. Still, not a bad flick. If you like the comedian, you'll LOVE him. If you don't, you STILL love him. Carrey does it with his great talent and comedic timing. And the movie isn't bad either. You gotta admit, once you start to laugh... you just don't stop. Lying can be fun!\nIt's not a spoiler to say that Carrey's character gets the opportunity to lie about something he really wanted, right? The problem is that a simple lie to his son (Justin Cooper) ends up becoming a lie to everyone around him. From his friends to the court jester, people keep asking him to lie and get him to say yes or no. He lies about every question, and when they ask \"Are you telling the truth\", he lies and says no.\"\nThe following is the full text of a review for the movie \"Holes\" from IMDB.com:\n\"Stanley Yelnats is a kid who has been unfairly sent to a boys' detention center, Camp Green Lake, for allegedly stealing a pair of shoes. And that's only the beginning of his problems... Along with a bunch of misfits, Stanley has to dig a giant hole every day (\"BUILD character!\"), under the supervision of the camp's sinister warden, as punishment. They also end up searching for the legendary treasure of legendary treasure hunter Kissin' Kate Barlow (yes, it's confusing!). The film's premise is nothing new: there have actually been so many similar movies in the past. But then, the film itself is actually pretty good. The writing's pretty good and the characters are well developed (in particular, we find a fascinating character in Kissin' Kate Barlow). What I enjoy most about the film is that it has a lot of humor, both from character interaction & visual gags. The characters are so funny and memorable that you can't wait to see them again, you almost wish there were more of them than just Stan and Zigzag! This is also a very nicely-shot film, with some good suspense moments. There's a nice twist at the end, too - it's not",
    "\"Judgment at Nuremberg\" is quite possibly one of the most brilliant, powerful, and intelligent films ever made. It addresses the Holocaust and the guilt, as well as the complicity of ordinary men for the most horrible atrocities of the last century, and is a masterpiece of intelligent filmmaking.\nIt is set in Germany immediately after WWII, and depicts the trial of four German judges who are on trial for their part in the Holocaust. The trial is presided over by four Allied judges, each an American, Frenchman, Russian, and Englishman. Each of the four have different views on what justice should be meted out to the four defendants. Spencer Tracy plays Judge Dan Haywood, an elderly Southern gentleman with a sense of fairness and a strong sense of justice. He is also an experienced legal mind, having presided over many criminal trials in the American South. He has a respect for the law and thinks highly of the judicial system. Max von Sydow plays Ernst Janning, a former judge who was sentenced to life imprisonment in a German concentration camp; he was released from that camp by the Allies. Burt Lancaster plays Dr. Hoffman, a doctor and scientist who was in Nuremberg to research the development of a vaccine in 1942. After the outbreak of the war, he became deeply involved in Nazi social activities and attended Nazi Party meetings. Marlene Dietrich is Maria Vhoisl, a female judge who was the wife of a Nazi judge, and a member of the Nazi Women's League. Judy Garland plays Hilary \"Hili\" Ewing, the court interpreter. She is a young, attractive, American woman born in Germany, and is an expert in the German language and American manners and laws. She is also an expert translator and has spent most of her life in Europe. She was one of the only Allied soldiers to enter Dachau concentration camp, and knows firsthand its horrors. Each of the actors does a solid job. They all did an excellent job with portraying the various parts. They all seemed to have a very strong understanding of their respective characters.\nThe story follows the trial of the four judges in a German city which had not yet been completely reconstructed. As the audience sees what happened throughout the trial, we are presented with a great deal of information which helps in understanding the story. We learn that the",
    "Catch Me If You Can is a funny, delightful, and very, very smart biographical story of a man who pretended to be something that he was not. It is based on the real-life story of Frank Abagnale, Jr., who at the very young age of 16, already with three arrests under his belt, forged checks for millions of dollars. As time passed, he did check forgeries all over America and also impersonated doctors, pilots, and lawyers. Eventually, he had to leave the country and flee arrest. The movie is a very interesting view into the life of this man and the methods that he used to successfully avoid capture. The movie is directed by Steven Spielberg, and although he is not usually one to do biopics, this one is excellent. The cinematography and score are absolutely perfect, and of course, the acting is superb. Leonardo DiCaprio is absolutely perfect as Frank Abagnale, Jr. and he completely deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance in the movie. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, with Tom Hanks proving once again just why he is one of the best actors in Hollywood. The movie is a very interesting story of a man who is a master of deception. It is both humorous and inspiring. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys both biopics and the comedies of Spielberg. It is an overall excellent movie that I very much enjoyed!\nThe following is the full text of a review for the movie \"Catch Me If You Can\" from the site Cinemablend.com: Catch Me If You Can is a film which has the potential to win over any moviegoer. At the same time, it is a film which, to some moviegoers, may prove challenging to embrace given the way in which director Steven Spielberg has chosen to present Frank Abagnale's story as a series of events and incidents. To some, it will be the film's most obvious flaw and the source of most, if not all, of the movie's problems. To others, it will be the film's biggest strength and reason for its eventual success. Indeed, to the latter group, Catch Me If You Can will be a highly successful work of entertainment. That's what happened here with one member of the moviegoing public. He is a movie fan",
    "Léon the professional - the one man army\nLéon (1998), Directed by Luc Besson, is a brilliant blend of art house style with a gritty violent narrative. You don't have to understand French, just see a subtitled version, as not one scene lasts for long. Each is brief and crisp - a few lines of dialogue or an action sequence - making the film incredibly watchable. All I can say is to prepare yourself for one very bizarre ride as Besson and Jean Reno (Léon) bring to life a world of crime, violence, and vengeance. Leon has been dubbed the 'one man army' and from the very first scene, as he kills the mob that breaks into his apartment, it is evident why.\nLéon's one man army status is best illustrated by this sequence. It takes place in a restaurant, a place full of mobsters and their victims. There is plenty of dialogue, delivered to the wrong person. Léon steps into the restaurant, and the first thing that happens is that the band of killers sitting at the next table notice him and, taking the cue, they begin to taunt a pretty young girl. They are going to force her 'to eat' in a manner which doesn't involve food. Meanwhile, the girl's brother comes to her defence and Leon is forced to act.\nLéon uses his 'gun' hand to pick up something at the table of the gang. It's a bread knife, and as he does this, he drops his gun into the lap of a man seated at an adjacent table. The gun falls out of his pocket, as Léon picks up the bread knife. This is all happening fast, and the 'one man army' is preparing for immediate action.\nAs he raises the bread knife one of the thugs standing behind the girl leans in to her, as he says something about her, and Leon begins chopping his neck with the knife. She falls, her dress is now up, showing a pair of legs in fishnets. We get a quick shot down Leon's gun barrel. His target is another thug, with a machine gun, which is pointing straight towards Leon. The gun gets a shot off, but Leon is quick enough to catch it in mid flight and the gun falls to the ground.\nAll this happens in a",
    "I had never read the Dan Brown novel so there was none of that \"but it goes like this!\" that gets very annoying when you've read the book. I did have the opportunity to learn that in the movie, Dan Brown (director Ron Howard) is the narrator of the story but is seen only on the big screen, not physically.\nThe movie was all I could expect: beautiful cinematography, incredible music, a plot that held my rapt attention the entire movie. But for all that, I couldn't help but think of other movies - in theme, plot, characters - that I'm glad I hadn't seen it first. \"Angels and Demons\" didn't match my expectations; it had some real weaknesses.\nFirst, and foremost, for those of you wanting to see THE movie of 2009, keep looking for another of that rarity and beauty. This movie was very enjoyable to a certain extent, with some moments that were a little hard to take seriously (not to mention the rather ludicrous and rather farfetched plot), but it's definitely not a movie to look for at the top of your must-see list.\nI went into this movie expecting not just another preachy Hollywood film full of mind-blowing, ridiculous and completely improbable plot lines, a couple attractive (and talented) leading characters, and a handful of good actors to fill the supporting roles. I went into the movie fully expecting to be thoroughly annoyed by some of these attributes as well as a few other elements that I didn't like in \"The Da Vinci Code,\" but I was pleasantly surprised.\nThe film was more believable than the last one and all that Hollywood eye candy that I had to suffer through the first time around was replaced with some fairly realistic-looking actors to fill important supporting roles. For a movie that is based on a fictional novel, the film seemed more realistic with its portrayal of Vatican politics. The second half of the film had me on the edge of my seat.\nSo it's fair to say that I would, in fact, recommend \"Angels and Demons\" as a decent, exciting blockbuster, but for those of you who expected \"The Dark Knight\" (and for those like me, who were lucky enough to see the former a few weeks ago) this is definitely not it.\nI give \"Ang",
    "\"I found myself surprisingly moved by this film.\"\nI wasn't really sure what to expect when I first saw this, but when I first saw it on TV when it came out, I was surprised at how much of it moved me.\nI'm not a huge drama person, but I really enjoy this movie for what it is - a look into the life of a group of guys in a boarding school.\nThe film opens with one character speaking, and then the narrator takes over.\nIt is a very simple film, and yet it is a deep and moving one.\nWe get to know the characters well enough to care about them, and there are some great scenes that really make us feel for the characters.\nI was surprised to see so many familiar faces in this film, including Kevin Spacey, Kate Winslet, and Michael Keaton.\nEach of them was perfectly cast in their roles, and I was able to actually connect with the characters and their stories.\nThe acting in this is a little too melodramatic for me, but you have to be willing to overlook that for the great stories you get in this movie.\nThe movie was originally made for TV, and I really liked how the film did not feel rushed at all.\nIt doesn't just come out and give us the ending, but I know that I enjoyed it more when I saw it in the theater.\nIt really does come out in a good way.\nI highly recommend this movie.\nThis is one of those movies that will stay with you long after you see it.\nYou can't even say that it's good.\nIt's just good.\nI think that everyone who has seen this movie knows what I'm talking about.",
    "Cidade de Deus (2002) aka City of God\n\nBrazil | 170min | Color\n\nThe first-ever winner of the coveted Academy Award for Best Foreign-language film, Fernando Meirelles' (Pena, 1995) movie based on the life of the Brazilian ghettos is a sprawling epic that can only be described as a monumental movie-making experience for all involved.\n\nThe story begins with the introduction of two children: Rocket, son of a lowly thief, and Li'l Dice, son of a highly esteemed drug boss. Rocket spends his days robbing and scrounging what he can, looking up to his role model Li'l Dice, but Dice's world will soon be turned upside-down when he is killed by a rival gang just as his mother has predicted. Rocket comes to Li'l Dice's rescue from a rival gang only to see him killed as well; just as Li'l Dice has a premonition of him being killed by a rival gang. Dice's only surviving son is now under the protection of Rocket and his father's gang. As Rocket grows, so does his gang, and eventually he inherits the leadership and takes over the area. As he grows in stature so do his goals and the larger gang's plans to establish the largest gang of the area—an area which we will hear throughout the movie referred to as a 'City of God'. As the action develops, Rocket is joined by his childhood friend Junior, who grows to become one of Rocket's closest associates and a master in the art of war. But while Rocket is leading the charge in warfare, he eventually finds that he is being set up at every possible turn by another man claiming the title of 'God'. With so many rivals trying to claim power, his crew weakens and Rocket becomes vulnerable to the threats that have been built against him...\n\nWhile critics argue the film's excessive violence, it's a fact that the violent nature of the slums has to be portrayed properly on-screen. In addition to scenes that illustrate the dangers of living in a place where every gang is set out to kill everyone else, this film is also a testimony to the fact that this is not Hollywood nor is it the United States of America, but rather it",
    "\"Kate Beckinsale reprises her role as fierce vampire Selene in this fourth installment, which finds her working as a private bodyguard. With some help from her werewolf lover Michael (Scott Speedman) and a group of fellow vampires and werewolves, Selene must take down the hybrid army and the vampire coven who want to annihilate the species. This installment's tagline is 'It was never a game,' and the trailer promises blood and violence galore. However Selene's biggest enemy is a group of humans, led by the menacing Vidric (Michael Ealy), who have the power to eradicate the two species.\"\nMy personal evaluation of the movie \"Underworld Awakening\":\nUnderworld Awakening is the third of the Underworld movies to star Kate Beckinsale, playing a female vampire named Selene. The franchise has been around since 2003, with two additional movies (Underworld Evolution and Underworld: Rise of the Lycans) preceding this one. As such, fans of the series will definitely want to head to the cinema to view Underworld Awakening, and there are plenty of reasons for them to do so.\nFor starters, Beckinsale continues to do her job extremely well, and fans who like their vampires to be tough and powerful will definitely be impressed. In fact, she is clearly the character that the movie is all about, and the action and special effects are all about her as well. The storyline also moves at a brisk pace, as Selene fights for life against Vidric and his hybrid warriors, along with some vicious vampires. Of course, fans will also appreciate the way that the movie is loaded with gore and action, and they will also like the way that the characters are introduced one by one. Indeed, Underworld Awakening has plenty going for it, and fans may find that it is the best of the Underworld movies to date.\nAs is typical of most films today, a sequel is a definite possibility for Underworld Awakening, in this case Underworld: Blood Wars.\nPosted by William A.

    "The Commitments is basically a comedy, but the situations portrayed are very realistic. They show how a group of friends living under the same set of circumstances can react very differently to the same situation. The main events in this movie involve the formation of a \"fake\" band and the band's eventual success. I say \"fake\" because they were pretending they were proficient musicians who could play the musical instruments that they only learned how to play shortly before they started playing. At first many of them thought that if they just played hard enough and long enough, that they would gradually improve, but that is not the case. In order to actually improve, they have to practice regularly and with someone who would give them direction and correct flaws in the music. Because of this, some of them quit, or were asked to quit. But I also think that the ones that stayed helped each other become skilled enough to perform in front of a live audience.\nThe group chose the film that gave the group its name, as a means of publicity. They decided to \"fake\" a television appearance based on the premise that they were performing music by The Clash. It was just their way of letting the public know who they were. When they finally actually performed on the local music show, they did not tell the director what they would be playing, so when they walked out on stage, they went straight into a piece of music that sounded like it was written by, or inspired by The Clash. This piece of music was not very good considering that the members of the group really did not know how to read music or play any instruments yet. Some of them couldn't even carry a tune, but the performance was not a very good way of attracting an audience. But if they had not performed then, it would have been difficult to establish credibility after they really started playing later on in the film.\nI was really impressed how the cast played their roles, because they did a convincing job convincing the audience that they really were people that had just decided to form a band. However, I was also impressed by how well they were able to convince us that their musicianship was not very good when they performed in the beginning of the film. It was a true \"fish out of water\" type of situation. But as the story goes from there, we follow their development from a band of wannabe's to real professionals, and they",
    "This movie has so much to offer but like any classic this movie can be a big hit or you could walk out of the theater not really liking it. I think it is a story that can be enjoyed by anyone who has seen this movie before. The thing about a classic movie is that it can be enjoyed over and over without being boring. The movie is full of memorable characters and music that will captivate your imagination and your heart. I have watched this movie many times over the years and I honestly think that it is a movie that could not be made today. If you have not seen this movie you should definitely check it out. There are some nice extras including a documentary about the making of the movie. The documentary is worth the price of admission alone. If you are trying to impress someone that you know then this is definitely the movie for you. The movie is full of moments that are really memorable but they are not the most interesting. There are moments that are actually very boring. I like the movie because of its great music and the good acting. There are a lot of characters in this movie that will make you say \"wow\" but they are not as memorable as the main character. The story is very simple and not very original but the movie is still enjoyable to watch. Overall this is a great film. It is not the best Disney movie but it is definitely one of the best Disney movies.\nLisa Johnson\nWednesday, 31 Jun 2020 20:28\nI think it is a classic and a great movie. It deserves lots of credit. I don't understand why it is not given the credit it deserves. This movie is about a kid that has problems on the way to his friend's birthday. He is getting some help from a friend named Peter. The movie is about some kid trying to overcome his fears and make things better in his life. He tries to make things better but he can't. He is scared because he doesn't want to have any problems.

    "\"There is some confusion as to how accurately the events are shown in this movie. I was there during this storm, as a 10 year old boy.\n1. Most important thing to remember: there are NO LIFE GUARDS on the coast in this area!!! This means...If you fall into the water...You are going to DIE!!! In spite of heroic efforts, all three men died.\n2. No CGI, no fancy special effects. Just an ordinary, everyday story of people trying to save a very unlucky ship.\n3. Good acting, good direction. Not a \"blockbuster\" but an honest depiction of the hardships that men went through to save lives. I recommend it highly.\n5.0 out of 5 starsTrue Story of Heroism\nThis film tells a true story that many of us have never heard - the heroic deeds of US Coast Guardsmen during the famous New England blizzard in 1952 that stranded a cargo ship off the shores of Gloucester, MA. There is a lot of debate about whether or not the story is accurate. Whether accurate or embellished, the fact is that an ordinary group of young men did truly heroic deeds. That alone makes it a worthwhile story.\nI will go farther and say that the film is excellent in its narrative. From the opening scene to its conclusion, it is a fast moving, fascinating story. Chris Pine and Casey Affleck do an excellent job portraying the two heroes who rescued three other co-workers from a ship that was breaking up in the vicious storm. Ben Foster has a smaller role as one of the heroes who dies during the rescue attempts. They are all first rate.\nAs someone who lived on the east coast near that time I can say that the storm was an epic event. A lot of people are not aware of it because there was no internet or social media to talk about it at the time. It's a great story and a great film. I highly recommend it.\n4.0 out of 5 starsA story of heroism\nI remember reading about this terrible event as a youngster.

    "So it's my view that \"Saul\" is trying to say is that the Shoah (the Holocaust) wasn't the work of the Germans and Nazis alone. As much as they caused it, it was the collective indifference, or perhaps hatred, of the Jewish people themselves. Those who worked hard to save their own families, those who tried to help and protect others, and those who stood by either doing nothing or doing little to nothing and even sometimes turning a blind eye to it all. These people are the heroes in this movie, and this is a movie that certainly should be seen.\n\"Son of Saul\" - directed and co-written by László Nemes as his feature directorial debut - was the overall winner of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival and has received numerous Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominations. Saul is portrayed by newcomer Géza Röhrig. There are many other fine supporting performances in this film, particularly Petronella Barzat, who portrays Zsuzsa. Röhrig, who was never a real person, brings to his role a remarkable sensitivity and raw emotional power. His acting is absolutely stunning. All in all, this is an emotional roller coaster of a movie and definitely recommended to all who love good film, and definitely a must see for all who are familiar with the Holocaust and want to know how the victims themselves experienced.\nThis film has been rated for \"some disturbing images and strong, but brief, language\".\nPlease note that this review and synopsis of the movie \"Son of Saul\" contains a large number of possible \"spoiler\" details (possible spoils as in they may contain the facts of this film's plot).

    "\"Hail, Caesar!\" is an enjoyable yet inconsequential period piece. This is not the type of movie usually covered here, but it still has some good performances that warrant a look.\nIn the film, a Hollywood fixer (charmingly played by Josh Brolin) tries to prevent an embarrassing situation from reaching the top brass at a major studio. The situation revolves around a popular young actor (George Clooney) and a leading lady, who happen to be married. He wants his spouse back to head of their studio, which has been going through a rough patch.\nClooney gives a fun performance as the overbearing movie star, while Tilda Swinton is very effective as his domineering wife. There's a good supporting turn from Ralph Fiennes as a studio boss who is no stranger to mischief. Unfortunately, there are too many characters and plots to keep track of, which leaves you feeling lost by the end. However, if you're a fan of the actors or the genre, you might be able to overlook these flaws.\nThe movie has a couple of memorable set-pieces, including a funny chase sequence involving a police car and an elephant. But the real highlight is the climactic scene, where the fix is about to break loose. This culminates in a showdown between the gangsters, the police, and the mob boss (played by Jeremy Strong).\nThe ending is so fast-paced that it's almost impossible to tell how everything unfolded. Even with a tight budget, the filmmakers managed to bring home the Oscar-winning performance from Clooney. Other highlights include cameos from Ralph Fiennes and Scarlett Johansson.\nAs for the supporting cast, the only one that's worth mentioning is Jonah Hill. The former star of \"Superbad\" is a standout, but is largely absent from the action. He adds his own brand of humor, but isn't able to really carry the film. At best, he's just another supporting cog in the wheel.\nOverall, the movie is fun and entertaining, but it's ultimately forgettable, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. There's not a lot of depth here, and the film won't leave you wanting more. It's just not something that will make you think about it afterward.\nIf you're a big fan of this",
    "The first two times I watched KAGEMUSHALast updated: Sun, 10 May 1998 09:00:00\nThe first two times I watched Kagemusha I didn't think it was a very good film. I found it confusing and pretentious, and I couldn't understand why everyone was raving about it so much. I kept hearing things like \"it's a masterpiece\" and \"it's one of Kurosawa's best.\" I was confused, because I couldn't imagine how this film was anything special. However, I recently watched it for the third time, and this time it blew me away. I started to see all the parts of the film that I had missed before, and I realized how fantastic Kagemusha is. My favorite part is that it can be read on an entirely different level than the basic story. The basic story of Kagemusha is a straightforward one: an impersonator is chosen to take the place of a ruling warlord, who is dying from an arrow wound. The impersonator, a nameless thief who calls himself \"Tatsuya,\" is an expert in acting. He knows that the people he has come to impersonate in Japan can't be fooled by falsehood. They must see everything as genuine. So he takes the warlord's body and soul, and performs the perfect imitation of his nature. Throughout Kagemusha, the character of \"Tatsuya,\" and the actor who plays him, the \"Imperial Messenger,\" are all actually portraying the character of \"Lord Shingen.\" The entire plot of the movie is \"Lord Shingen's\" life. The plot of Kagemusha itself is what Tatsuya's story really is. Tatsuya's true story is his transformation into a person who looks exactly like Lord Shingen. Because the character of \"Tatsuya\" and Kagemusha himself are actually portraying Lord Shingen throughout the film, we never really know who he is. \"He\" is actually \"Tatsuhisa\" until about half-way through the movie, when his character, \"Tatsuhisa\" dies. We have no idea who he is, until right before Tatsuya meets Lord Shingen. It is Tatsuya's great talent as an actor to make us believe that he is, in fact, Lord",
    "This movie really surprised me. I was expecting a big, loud DeNiro type remake only to find one of the most well thought out and well done gangster movies of the 80's. All the stars were well cast except for one. What was that guy who played Ness doing in this movie? His was the only performance that was less than believable and his lines sounded too rehearsed. I also loved the use of the 50's black and white film technique to show footage of Ness's early days. To go along with the 1950's feel, Frank Sinatra provides the voice of the narrator for the prologue and the beginning of each segment. And the music. The music is fantastic! All original and very much in keeping with the film. But it wasn't till the last ten minutes that my jaw hit the floor. I'm sure you all have seen the dramatic ending of this film. The two last shots are really moving. My only beef is that the last shot is too close to the camera and doesn't take full advantage of the great visual that it could have been. Still, the impact of the scene is not detracted from and the whole movie is worth seeing again just for that ending.\nThe movie \"The Untouchables\" was rated with a score of 9 from 10 on IMDb.com.

    "Akira is a truly amazing movie. The story may seem a bit confusing with so many characters involved and so much happening in the film, but its definitely worth the watch. It also has a beautiful and unique look with its post-apocalypse settings, interestingly designed and detailed animation work, and the vivid colors and interesting character designs in the costumes. Akira is a movie that is difficult to define, but if you give it a chance it might just change your life. I give Akira 10 stars.\n\nAkira is a wonderful animated film about a young boy who has the potential to change the world. Akira can be compared to the superheroes of our time, with an origin story and a conflict. It also deals with what can happen if this potential is not used. Akira's story and themes are relevant to today's world. It is an animated film that tells a story about a young boy who has the potential to change the world. You may already have seen this film, but if not, you must see it.\n\nAkira is a beautiful and powerful movie, but it is also an extremely complex one. The plot is complex and hard to follow, and the characters are not the most likable characters of my lifetime. Akira tells the story of a young girl named Kay who loses her father in the war. One day, Kay and her younger brother J.J. get lost in a labyrinth and they find the \"Akira\" artifact. The artifact is an ancient artifact that is supposed to have the power to change the world. At the end of the film, J.J. and Akira save the world.\nAkira is a spectacular film, but its not without flaws. First off, the ending is somewhat anticlimactic, with Kay not being the first to save the world from Akira. I also had some problems with some of the plot points, and some of the characters were hard to understand. But the story was original and interesting, and the animation was beautiful and unique.\n\n**Plot Summary** Akira is an animated drama/fantasy which follows the story of a young boy, Akira, who has the potential to save humanity from the apocalypse after being taken from his family and forced to work in an orphanage for years. Through a series of events, Akira discovers the truth about his origin. The story",
    "As someone who has spent much of the last three decades immersed in popular culture and its analysis I can state with confidence that Stephen Hawking is a celebrity in a way that few other scientific figures have been. And while there have been other films devoted to him, including the very good documentary \"A Brief History of Time\", \"The Theory of Everything\" is a very particular take on his story. It doesn't treat him exclusively as a scientist (he's only shown lecturing a small group once all through the film), but presents him as an icon of optimism and intellectualism as much as anything. His disability is shown more than once, but is only an element of the film; it does not center on his illness. The main elements are his personal relationships. What made the story unique was the way in which the film handled the matter of how Hawking's paralysis was to be portrayed. Early in the film, we're introduced to Stephen before he becomes dependent on a wheelchair, but very shortly into the story, we're told that his condition has progressed to the point where we will never see him standing again. Instead, when it shows flashbacks of Stephen walking we are told that the images aren't actually Stephen walking, but rather his imagination remembering what it was like to go for a stroll.\nAnother film about a world-famous scientist, the movie \"The Imitation Game\", won four Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Benedict Cumberbatch. I do not recall ever seeing a movie about a famous scientist, other than Hawking, that won even one Oscar. Why is that, when so many scientists are well known in other ways such as through their scientific research?\nStephen Hawking is an exceptional icon not only because of his scientific discoveries, but also because of his triumph over seemingly insurmountable disability.\nIn my book, \"The Myth and the Moment: The Origins of Social Security in the United States\", I discuss how Americans have a sense of personal independence that has been developed by our history as a frontier people. People still like to think that they are not beholden on anyone and that they can take care of themselves. However, one of the things that Social Security represents is that people do need the help of others, both to provide income after retirement and to provide medical care when they are no longer able to do so. It's not necessary for people to become",
    "\"The word \"sparkly\" is often used in reference to vampires, the undead creatures that roam the world after dark. It is also fitting and appropriate to describe anything involving the \"Twilight\" saga.\nThe story of a young man who realizes he is a vampire and must protect a young, mortal girl from the town he resides in is more than just a cute, romantic fantasy. This is, however, what \"Twilight\" is.\nEdward (Rob Pattinson) is a seventeen-year-old (but looks like he is eighteen) vampire who comes from a long line of supernatural guardians, but his lineage doesn't mean much because vampires are now extinct. In the midst of his own despair as a vampire without a companion, he meets Bella (Kristen Stewart), a sixteen-year-old girl who is so human that he could eat her like a midnight snack if he wanted to.\nInstead of doing that, Edward chooses to be friends with her and her friend, Jacob (Taylor Lautner), much to the chagrin of her family who thinks he is a dangerous, untrustworthy fellow. Edward does his best to protect Bella from vampires who think she would be a great human snack, as well as Jacob who is a werewolf that is in love with Bella. He also must do this while not giving into the desire to make Bella his own.\nBella and Edward begin to fall in love, but their love affair will never be if Bella finds out that she will die in eighteen years because she is mortal and Edward is immortal. I think this is a wonderful scenario for a teen romp that is both adorable and angsty. It has all the elements of the classic story of a forbidden romance. It feels and even smells familiar.\nI think the \"Twilight\" saga has finally brought a romantic vampire film to wide audiences that deserves recognition for its literary merit. It is a simple story that appeals to a wide audience based on the classic fairy tale of two lovers that no one thinks will survive, but are able to do so.\nThis movie is not without criticism from the critics. There are a number of problems with the movie, but I think they are minor and forgivable given that \"Twilight\" is not a masterpiece by any means, and there are many, many vampire films that make mistakes.\nI think \"",
    "What a way to begin the New Year! You're going to have to excuse me as I don a wedding gown and sing about a \"new brideside in town\" -- even if it is only for the next 1500 or so words. The 1998 romantic comedy film \"The Wedding Singer\" starring Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, and Christine Taylor hit the cinemas January 16th of that year. The film is based on the 1987 television series by the same name, and is itself an adaptation of the 1993 play of the same name.\n\"The Wedding Singer\" is a fun movie to watch -- not only if you are a Sandler fan, but even if you typically don't find a Sandler movie so appealing. His character, Robbie Hart, is a hopeless romantic who always ends up with the wrong woman (as in, not the woman he actually wants) and spends most of the film trying to woo his true love, Julia (Taylor) out of her marriage.\nSandler, as he always does, manages to take what appears to be a simple, formulaic story, and bring it to life. He's able to convey the pain, anguish, love, and longing of being in a relationship that \"should be, could be, just so very perfect, but isn't.\" It is also clear that Barrymore puts a lot of effort into her role of Julia Gannon, and it doesn't go unrewarded. We see a woman torn between her husband, a man she has loved for years, and her true love, who she knew she'd marry from college, but never thought she could attain. Both couples have been friends for years, and it's always been the Hart/Julia relationship that was at the forefront.\nJulia: Yeah. I was going to tell you.\nJulia: Yeah, I was gonna tell you but I didn't know what to say.\nRobbie: I'm sorry, man.\nJulia: I wish I could be with you.\nRobbie: I'll wait for you.\nJulia: What if I never, uh...What if I couldn't ever make it?\nRobbie: I'd wait. I'll wait for you forever.\nJulia: Oh, Robbie. Oh, I love you --\nJulia: I love you, too.\nRobbie",

They will need it, as they prepare to battle the final onslaught of the Sentinel machine army under the command of a new master. The battle for Zion will be the biggest battle of the war. The final battle between Good and Evil.\"\nThe Matrix Revolutions is one of the most confusing and mind numbing films ever made. If you actually want a film about philosophy and concepts of morality and spirituality, watch The Matrix. Forget about it and watch The Matrix Reloaded if you want a film about action and character development.\nNeo and Trinity were sent to the \"construct\" program where a copy of them in a perfect world, or Zion, can live on. Zion has become a city on the beach, where people live an eternal utopian existence, spending all their time playing video games for fun. Neo and Trinity, as children, find the escape pod that will return them to Neo's world, where the real Neo and Trinity, and the rest of the Resistance, face the ultimate battle against the Sentinels. The movie starts in Zion, but is constantly interrupted by flashbacks to Neo's world. The problem is that the filmmakers make it extremely difficult to tell which world we are in at one time.\nThe Matrix Revolutions is a huge disappointment for me. A story about the afterlife is really about hope. It is about the struggle of the human spirit to overcome even the most unbelievable odds. The Matrix Revolutions lacks the heart that was displayed in the other two films. It appears to be little more than a final test of the audience",

It is a modern-day horror movie that will keep you up all night and scared for days.\nThe Orphan is about a young boy who lost both his parents at a young age. He is now in the care of his grandmother. The little girl is terrified by his grandmother and her caregiver, and is so frightened by her grandmother's treatment that she is scared to speak.\nThe story unfolds as the little boy's grandmother continues to torment him, giving him nightmares, and when he finally runs away, he finds himself hunted down by the caregiver and grandmother.\nThis movie is an interesting look at how children, in order to survive, must face their fears even if it means putting their lives in danger.

    "As I think about the Eclipse movie, as well as the rest of the Twilight series, it occurs to me that the story of Bella and Edward as they fight against the forces of evil, with Jacob as their loyal sidekick, might easily be the stuff of a children's book. Children in the target demographic will easily relate to the good vs. evil situation, and many of them might find the idea of vampires, and a handsome werewolf boyfriend, appealing. There is nothing subtle or complex about this series. The characters could almost be from central casting. The acting is a bit wooden, or should I say stilted?\n\n**Figure 4.5** **The movie poster from** **The Twilight Saga: Eclipse.** _Source_ : Summit Entertainment Marketing.\n\n##  Actors Make or Break a Movie\n\nWe mentioned earlier that actors can make or break a show. Sometimes this is not the case (see Figure 4.7), and other times it makes the difference between a so-so show and a smash.\n\n##  Stars Get Top Billing\n\nThe Hollywood trade magazines that announce upcoming movies include listings of the _stars_ – the _real_ stars, not the supporting cast. The star is the one person who is considered the box office attraction for the movie. That person gets top billing. In TV movies (and on TV series where a main character leaves or dies), the character sometimes is given a \"spin-off show\" that features that character.\n\n##  Movie Sequels\n\nA number of shows have become successful enough that the networks have decided to continue making sequels to them. One of these is the show _Frasier_. _Frasier_ first aired on NBC in 1993 as a spin-off from the show _Cheers_.

    "O'Keefe's Rating: 3.5 out of 5 Stars\nThere are a lot of interesting facts about the Apollo program that may or may not be included, but are missing. The main focus of the film is Neil and his personal life while he's making history. It's not a boring movie by any means; the performances are great by all actors (Claire Foy as Janet is an absolute joy to watch) and it's the first dramatic film that I want to see again, at least as soon as we get it on Blu Ray.\nThis is the story of Neil Armstrong, Janet Armstrong, Ed White and the team that put a man (Astronaut) on the Moon.\nIt starts with the Mercury program, and then goes into the Gemini program, where Neil, among others, became a star of the program, due to his skill in the capsule and his ability to fix the problems on the fly.\nA lot of the story is about Neil and Janet and their relationship, but he does have some relationships outside of the family, such as his boss Deke Slayton and his team. Deke is the guy I would like to have on my side in any situation. One of the highlights of the movie was when he told the Apollo team to relax because they wouldn't be going anywhere if their performance wasn't up to par.\nWhile they were in space, they could feel when something went wrong with the capsule, which was really cool. We get to hear that some of the missions failed due to malfunctions, like the Mercury program, and that Apollo 1 didn't die in the Apollo 1 capsule, but the entire crew died in the crew capsule. This is a problem most Apollo historians have with the movie.\nWhile the rest of the film is very factual, the ending is fiction. The last scene when Neil sees people trying to give him a medal of honor is wrong. We know that he accepted no such award. He simply waved out of the car windows and went home when he landed. He did take a tour of NASA, and accepted praise from NASA staff.\nThis movie is pretty accurate on the technical aspects. One of the interesting technical facts that I've learned is that it's not safe for astronauts to breathe through their mouths, and as such had no lip movement when they could. For the movie and for the real life,",
    "A new breed of hooligan. In London's East End. And how to make a bad man - good.\nThe setting of this story is in East London, in the city's famous working-class area known as the East End. The East End, historically referred to as the'slums of London', is known for being home to the Whitechapel District, famous for the 1888 Jack the Ripper murders. For a young lad growing up in the East End, there are a lot of things to do. Being that the East End is so close to the City of London and the Canary Wharf business district, there are a lot of white collar jobs and high salaries. However, it is also home to the most notorious organized crime outfit in the entire country: the English Criminal Syndicate, or E.C.S./the Firm, and the most infamous group of soccer hooligans in the country, the Inter City Firm/I.C.F. Both groups are infamous within their respective circles for their violence, greed, and ability to do the impossible. For both groups, no job is too big and no job, no matter how impossible and ridiculous, is too small. The E.C.S./Firm is run by a man named Charlie Morris. Charlie Morris is the head of the Firm, a crime lord who can get a man killed or put in prison with a single phone call. Charlie Morris made his money illegally, during the great riots of the 1980s, and he is rumoured to own half of East London thanks to the hundreds of criminal enterprises he secretly owns or finances. These are the two things that young men growing up in the East End, young men who have never known any type of decent work or family support, long to join; the Firm, known for its money, power, and ability to help a man succeed, and the I.C.F., known for its ability to help a youngster prove himself as a \"hard man\". For these reasons, these two groups are the two most feared groups in modern London. The most violent of all is the E.C.S./Firm. They've got ruthless, hardened men, who never let anything slide, as henchmen, who have a knack for eliminating enemies and rivals, but not the I.C.F. The I.C.F",
    "This film is quite a gem. It's a visual and musical spectacle that was a delight from start to finish. The story is simple, but the depth of emotion is what really got to me. The main characters, George and Peppy, are played to perfection by Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo. There are no glaring flaws in the performance. The two actors have the star quality that's rare to find.\nThe 1920’s were a time of great change in film. It was the era of the silent movie. Film has come a long way since then. There were many actors and actresses throughout history that made their mark in the silent movie era. Some are forgotten. Others are still remembered today. One forgotten actress of that era is Peppy Miller. Her film career is on the decline.\nGeorge Valentin is a successful, charismatic actor. When he goes to meet Peppy on the set of her film, he is in awe of her beauty. Peppy is only doing one scene of a movie that she is involved in. The movie is called “Queen of Hollywood” It’s a musical movie. When Peppy’s film scene is done, the scene is over and the film is left unfinished in an editing room. George sees Peppy and is drawn to her. They fall in love. Their love is tested by the challenges ahead in Hollywood. George is in denial that “talkies” are taking over the industry. Peppy has a chance to make it. Her singing talent is realized. The movie ends with a surprise ending.\nI found the music to be quite enjoyable. I like the music in film noir. When the characters had a romantic dinner together and played “La Mer” on a phonograph, the scene was touching. I was happy when I saw Jean Dujardin get an Oscar for this film. It was one of the funniest and most emotional ones of the year I have seen.\nI was watching this film recently. I found it to be a delight. It made me happy and sad all at the same time.\nI enjoyed the fact that this movie was set in 1927 to 1931. It’s a nice touch to the film.\nIn the film, the main character is George Valentin who’s a successful silent movie star. A very famous actress, Peppy Miller, played by the",
    "(Rated R)\nStarring: Anthony Hopkins, Matthew McConaughey, and Morgan Freeman.\nSummary: Based on true events relating to the revolt on board a Spanish slave ship.\nReview: The \"facts\" presented here are pretty good, except, as many reviews have pointed out, \"history is not fiction\". To make the movie \"seem\" more believable, it is essential to change a number of facts, some of which would never have been known. It is difficult, or even impossible, to verify their authenticity, but this movie is most definitely not true.\nThe most notable change, and probably the biggest, is of the mutiny. Realistically, the events that took place could not have happened as they were shown, and never should have been put into the movie. The \"facts\" that were modified would be the details relating to each particular slave who was murdered in the revolt. According to the \"facts\" (for what they're worth), the slaves did not kill their captors. No, they merely took those who had been oppressing them and left them. In fact, most of them actually helped to clean up the blood and remove all of the limbs from the corpses, including their own. Now I know that's rather brutal, but if you look past all of that, it was quite ingenious. The captain of that ship had his men kill them, which in turn gave the slaves a \"reason\" to revolt. One could only imagine what that would do to someone who had been a slave for the last four days without water. Not only that, the captain was killed, but his men were not. They were captured and they were forced to work with them. Now this would have been acceptable if the slave ship was run by the Spanish government and the whole incident was resolved by their \"justice\", but they weren't. The slave ship was owned by a private company and, as such, the company was able to take these men to Spain and have them put in prison. One must remember, at this time, Spain was not a liberal country by any means. In fact, they were probably the most reactionary on the planet. This was the same country that had been killing heretics for three centuries. Spain had not only sent a number of inquisitions all over the Mediterranean, but their inquisitions had become quite the industry",

It was interesting, watching the movie, to make the comparisons of this role to the role in which Daniel Radcliffe is probably the most recognized.\n\nThe story itself was compelling, and it had so many aspects of the gothic and horror that was so popular from the end of the eighteenth century, into the 1800s, and up well until the 1960s or so. Perhaps the genre is about to be rediscovered as a popular form in film, in this time when we as a society seem to have forgotten how to appreciate the art of horror. This movie reminded me of the kind of suspense, building up from the beginning, and in this respect, it was quite comparable to the original version of _Psycho_. It was also the role that reminded me of this, as we saw the man, Arthur Kipps, who had recently been married, but after finding it difficult for him to settle down with his bride, had decided to go away for a few days, to a place as far away as possible, to help him put things in perspective and calm down. His friends in the village were encouraging, with one in particular who offered to send Kipps the horse and carriage for Kipps to go to the area where he wished to go.\n\nOnce at the place, the audience is shown the house that Kipps is staying at, and from the beginning we come to know that something is very wrong with the household. The family are very strange, almost to the point of being unnerving. Kipps is given a bed to stay in and he feels uneasy about where this will be, and he is right, because after a series of strange occurrences, he realizes that this bed is the same one in which his replacement slept, and was the same bed that his replacement woke from a night before, and which he, of course",
    "\"Watching Invictus, I kept thinking that this was like a great, powerful, stirring sports book that had been reduced to a one-hour ESPN movie. The film follows the arc of the film Mandela's life from his release from prison to the first ever interracial World Cup competition.\nThe problem is that the two hour plus movie is told in the format of an ESPN movie by jumping from match to match instead of following any matches to a conclusion or exploring the cultural impact of a match or of a tournament. By cutting short the story so many times for yet another match it actually loses its impact.\nWhat I enjoyed the most was the acting, and there were plenty of great actors to work with here. Morgan Freeman was fantastic as Mandela, and you could almost feel his age after being in prison for nearly two decades (although I always feel it's a little weird to cast Freeman when the role calls for someone black). Matt Damon was also pretty impressive.\nAnd finally, Clint Eastwood also did an amazing job. Eastwood really brought his A-game to this film, which is rather remarkable since he's done nothing since Mystic River six years ago that even faintly approaches this caliber of work.\nI also think this is very likely to be one of the five best films of 2009. It's just so well done and thought out and it has a lot of heart in it. It doesn't have the visceral power of a film like Slumdog, and it's a bit too long, but it is still a very, very fine film with great acting and an uplifting message.

It's like Disney cartoons. You have to let it go over your head and accept them as what they are, an animated fantasy (the only way to get away with \"feel good endings\" and such).\nIn this version, Willie Wonka's character is absolutely different (he acts like Willy Wonka). It goes against the book, against the original movie, and against every preconception most people would have about the character. In the book (and in the original movie) Willy Wonka is an eccentric, quirky genius - he would never be what Denzel Washington is (a charming con man).\nThe ending does NOT hold together at all. It does not work. It doesn't even make sense.\nTo make the movie have any pretense of logical sense, it would have to have a different ending. But then the problem would be: what would you do with a different ending?\nIt's still a good film",

The film grossed $347.6 million worldwide (third highest grossing film of the year), and is now the third highest grossing film in the United States and Canada, behind only Titanic (1997) and The Fate of the Furious (2017).Home Alone 2: Lost in New York stars Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern and Catherine O'Hara reprising their roles from the first film, and is the only sequel in the series to star the original cast. It was released exactly 10 years after the original. The cast also includes Eddie Deezen, Robert Sabin, Gerry Bamman, Sally Shepard, Harry Anderson, Tim Curry, and Angela Goethals.

    "The \"Terminator Salvation\" is a very poorly made, poorly directed, and boring movie. It is one of the worst movies to ever be released in movie theaters. This movie does not need to exist.\nThis movie is directed by McG, a guy who previously directed a few bad action films like \"Charlie's Angels\", \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\", \"We Are Marshall\", and \"The Babysitters\". None of his previous movies were awful as this one was. This movie is more similar to a cheesy Syfy Channel movie than it is to a major motion picture film. This movie is horrible, even for a \"Terminator\" movie. I think that the previous \"Terminator\" movies are much better than this one.\n\"Terminator Salvation\" is about a battle between T-800 Terminators and machines from a future war. Christian Bale plays Marcus Wright, the father of John Connor (Nick Stahl), the boy who became the great leader of humans in the future war fought against the machines after the nuclear holocaust in the future. When John is a very small boy, a T-800 Terminator attacks his base camp. John's mother is killed by the Terminator in the attack. The T-800 Terminator is destroyed and Marcus has no way of going back in time. Marcus knows that humans don't have a chance to fight in any war against the machines. The only thing that humans can do it try to send Marcus back to his past in time and try to avert the future holocaust. The machines in the future must be terminated and Marcus will try to do anything to make this happen. Marcus and his friends must go back in time to kill John Connor and therefore destroy the future war that will destroy humanity in an all-out battle against machines.\nWhile the movie \"Terminator Salvation\" does focus on the war that humans and machines have in the future it spends almost all of its time in Marcus' life in a very boring fashion. \"Terminator Salvation\" never spends enough time on the cool idea, the battle that could destroy the future of mankind. The movie spends a lot of its time on Marcus and his friends running around town, hiding from the police, and hiding from their enemies. This takes place more than half of the movie. This makes \"Terminator Salvation\" an",
    "This was the novel that launched the modern fantasy genre, and was so loved by readers the world over it launched a series that now has seven volumes. This first book begins with Harry Potter [played by Richard Harris in the film], an ordinary boy who learns he is an unusual boy—a boy destined to do great things—after he is invited to enroll at Hogwarts, a school for young wizards. From this point on, he enters a world of adventure. He learns magic, makes friends whose courage and loyalty are tested in battle against a formidable foe, and discovers that in the end, love—real love—conquers all.\n\nFor most people, these few sentences sum up pretty well what the reader wants to know about the book. Many times, a reader who is contemplating a book or movie purchase will read the brief description of what it's about from the publisher, or if they're perusing movie offerings on the Internet, they can read the plot summary. This kind of information is what the story editor was probably looking for. At this point, the editor would be wondering \"Will this be a good movie?\" or, if they're working with the publisher, \"Will this be a good book?\" or if they were working with a play, \"Would this sell tickets?\"\n\nThe second section of a review is where you describe what the book or movie is actually about, using this as an opportunity to tell people who are thinking about purchasing the book or movie that this is a good purchase. If you're writing your own reviews, you can find the details on various places on the Internet—IMDb.com gives a good synopsis of all the movies on their site, and most books have reviews on various sites. If what you're writing about doesn't have its own listing, you can find details online or use the book itself as a guide to what's going on and what are the key scenes in the book. Use the story structure mentioned in Chapter 1, which you'll need if you want to understand the book and the way the movie portrays that story.\n\nThe third section of a review is where you talk about the performance of the lead actors, and you want to concentrate on the lead actors rather than on small parts.

    "The Departed was released in 2006, and as always, it’s best to watch and review it in the context of its time. When it came out, it quickly became a contender for the annual Oscars, despite its heavy violence, foul language, and its grim, almost relentless storyline.\nThe Departed is not a new movie on many levels, and most of the things that make the movie work were also used in such classic noirish films as In a Lonely Place (1950), The Godfather (1972), and The Godfather: Part II (1974). The only true thing I can say about this movie is not only was Scorsese on his very best, but his best work was not directed at him, but instead, was directed at and by him.\nIn 2004, Scorsese directed an equally gritty, and equally dark movie, Gangs of New York, which is one of his best. At one point during the movie, Scorsese directed the camera to focus on the facial expressions of Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Cameron Diaz. This is a rather boldly, direct, and blatant move on the part of the director, but at the time, it was a bit disturbing. It is as if the director was directing you to pay attention to the face of the character. The director even went as far as to focus the camera on the faces of the two young actors as well. He was directing his audience to recognize the similarity between the two actors.\nThe Deported movie also features several scenes featuring the director’s friend and mentor, Paul Newman. One of the highlights of the movie is Mr. Newman’s narration over the end of the movie. This narration is a little bit disturbing, but is also quite well-written. It is not a big deal, but it is interesting to note that the director uses the voice of Mr. Newman to narrate the end of this movie. It is an interesting choice.\nThe movie also features one interesting moment involving Leonardo DiCaprio. At the end of the movie, DiCaprio is seen lying in a bathtub. His wife is talking about his impending death. She says that his death was caused by a car crash, but Leonardo DiCaprio is not dead. It is unclear if he is really alive",
    "Based on the true story of the 1971 Virginia High School football team known as the Titans, coached by Herman Boone from Alexandria, Virginia. With the help of the players' determination and a few creative stratagems, Boone helps his men to excel on the field despite the bigotry they all face off it.\nReview #19 for \"Remember the Titans\" (2000)\n\"Duke\", \"Duke\" (2000) (8 out of 10)\nThis is not a bad movie and it is worth seeing, it is somewhat boring but with some touching scenes. As a movie about Duke basketball it is pretty good and a bit of an inspirational biographical film and I can see a teenager liking this movie, I know I would have grown up watching basketball on tv and I am a big sports fan, maybe I would have even seen the trailer for this movie. It is no classic but it is above average as you can expect from this genre of film and I give it a decent rating. I thought the acting was okay, I suppose with this type of role it is difficult to know how to act but it is alright. The pacing is decent and the soundtrack is okay, if anything I guess I would say that the direction is decent. The movie is not bad and I enjoyed seeing it, I feel like I can justifiably give it a positive rating. I do like movies about sports, they are a good way to be entertained and I enjoy seeing underdogs do well as we can look at them as inspirations and they win in life and not just on the court. I think that the movie \"Blue Chips\" is the best sports movie about basketball that I have ever seen and this movie was decent but it should not be compared to the classics, which is probably why I rated it a little lower, this movie is a decent film which is a good attempt at covering a real sports story and it is worth seeing on occasion. I give this film an average rating but I have to wonder how accurate it is, it is probably accurate but I would like to see one that is more accurate.\n\"Duke\" (2000) (8 out of 10)\nTitle: \"A Perfect World\" (1993)\nDirector: Clint Eastwood, \"A Perfect World\" (1993)\nThis is a decent movie and the acting is good as well as the direction,",
    "I just finished watching the movie, which I rented in video form from Blockbuster. It was amazing!\nFor most of the time, I didn't understand what was going on and why the people in the movie kept taking this drug which supposedly made their memories more powerful. But then, after an especially hard fight scene with Kiefer Sutherland and Emily Watson, and a couple more drugs, I started to realize what the movie was about.\nI'm a college student and a great deal of what I learn in college are what is called \"new concepts.\" A new concept is a theory or belief which is new to our world but which people can discover anew every generation. In other words, it is an idea which has been forgotten. It is a theory which is new to this generation but which has been discovered again. Such was the case in \"Dark City.\" As I found out through the course of the film, the drug that the people were taking was really nothing more than what we call a \"n-dimensional plane.\"\nFor people who are not familiar with \"n-dimensional planes,\" think of a three dimensional plane; think of a box. Now, put all of those planes together and you have an \"n-dimensional plane.\" In this plane, there could be anything, even people and things just like you and me. But in this plane, there would be only a tiny part of the entire plane which people would inhabit. This part of the plane is called a \"point in time.\"\n\"Dark City\" is about a few people from the present being drawn into another time period in the history of that place called \"Earth.\" They soon come to realize that the people they were drawn up in were not the same people they began life with. Instead, they were in control of a group of people who had been \"changed\" in some way that they are no longer able to remember who they were or what they were doing in that other time period. The name of the time frame that \"Dark City\" is being released to is called the \"Age of Terror\" because the people in that time period lived in fear. They were terrified by what was happening and did not know why.\nIn the words of \"Dark City\" producer/director Richard Kelly, \"This movie is about a man who experiences a life in a city which he did not choose.\" The characters in",
    "\"What started on a movie set in 2014, a conversation about a young white filmmaker's attempt to explore the Black community, ended up taking the filmmakers on an extremely uncomfortable path with no guarantees, and a whole lot of uncertainty.\nDirector Spike Lee, one of the most renowned American independent filmmakers of our time, and his frequent collaborator David Rabinowitz embarked on a journey that led them deep into the heart of the White Supremacist movement in America, by first meeting with and befriending local KKK leader David Duke.\nTheir meeting would start a chain of events that led to Lee and Rabinowitz embedding themselves in the KKK's hierarchy in hope of bringing down the organization.\nBlacKkKlansman has just been released in theaters on August 10th and it is now available to rent on all streaming services.\nBlacKkKlansman tells a true story, starting in North Carolina, 1972 the African American Ron Stallworth manages to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan through telephone conversation with a member of the local Ku Klux Klan, David Duke.\nWith the help of his colleague, an African American police detective, Flip Zimmerman, who was forced to play the part of Stallworth in front of the Klan, the two set out to prove that the KKK is a threat to the society by befriending the top head of KKK, Duke.\nDuke being the most popular and outspoken KKK leader at a time where the Klan was struggling, the film tells the true story of a brave officer who stood up against a group that caused racial segregation and discrimination in America.\nBased on a real-life investigation by the African American detective Ron Stallworth, who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the early 1970s, and the white police officer Flip Zimmerman, whose help Ron Stallworth recruited in his attempt to put an end to the KKK. The story features two main characters played by two of the most talented black actors of the moment, John David Washington (who is Denzel Washington's son) and Adam Driver (from HBO's Girls and Logan Lucky).\nThis is definitely one of the most realistic, and terrifying movies about the Ku Klux Klan, the racism that is still very present in the world, and about two black men",
    "\"Told by flashback, the story deals with two men, Jack (Shepard) and Ennis (Heath Ledger) who meet in the summer of 1963 when Ennis and his father Alma (Tommy Lee Jones), have a job herding sheep on Brokeback Mountain. Jack, one of the hired hands, is attracted to Ennis and the two embark on a brief affair, the details of which are mostly left to the audience's imagination.\nIt is only the first chapter of their story, however. Another ten years pass. This is where Ledger's character is introduced. He's a rough-looking cowboy with a shaky past — not too hard to imagine — and no future. He has a run in with Jack and the result is that the men end up working for six weeks on a cattle round-up. Ennis, who's just got out of jail, takes on the job as punishment for his latest misdeed. Jack is hired as his temporary partner.\nThe film is based on a short story by Annie Proulx. Like Proulx's story, which was published in the New Yorker, this movie is largely about the nature of male bonding and is set against an unforgiving landscape.\nThe two actors give stunningly restrained performances and their characters' dilemma is heartbreaking. They are both attractive men — the movie is beautifully photographed — but in Brokeback their only real choices are to suffer in silence and denial or to destroy each other in the search for some kind of fulfilment.\nWe could argue about their choices, but we could never argue about the quality of their performances. It's clear they don't approve of themselves, but their performances are magnificent. Shepard is best known as a screenwriter. Ledger, on the other hand, has been acting since he was a kid in Australia, but I've never seen him turn in a performance this good.\nBrokeback Mountain gets one of the oddest ratings in the history of IMDb. At 4,826 members, the 4,941 votes cast against it make this the most negative score for any film in history.\"\nAfter getting a review for a movie that IMDb.com describes as \"A homosexual cowboy can't escape his troubled childhood.\" What could possibly go wrong?\nWell in all fairness to Brokeback Mountain",
    "\"Radio,\" the film by German writer/director Michael Riesner (2003) is based on the \"autobiographical confession\" of a young Jew named Erich Kompan (played by Elyas M'Barek) who joined the Hitler Youth, the National Socialist (Nazi) Party, and the German Army as a youth. As depicted in this film, young Erich is a Jew who doesn't know that he's Jewish. As if his ignorance of his own background isn't enough, Erich is adopted by a German family after leaving his \"foster mother.\" All of Erich's \"foster mothers\" and adoptive parents are, of course, German Nazis.\nThe film is told in flashback sequence. The first image we see is of Erich lying on a concrete floor, obviously a prisoner in the concentration (prison) camp at Buchenwald. We then follow Erich back as he recalls his life as a child and \"child soldier\" for the Nazis.\nErich is a Jew who has a \"good childhood\"; in his own words his \"life was good.\" The problem is that Erich is \"gifted.\" The Nazi Party sees his talent as a \"threat.\" His foster mother suggests that rather than being a threat, he is a \"wonder\" who needs to be \"trained.\" It was at that point that Erich's mother became very concerned for her child. She had already seen her husband (Ernst's birth father) taken away due to her association with Jews and Communists. She knows that if her son is noticed, or reported by someone who sees him for what he is, it could mean death for her and her family. Her concern was not so much for herself, as she had a \"strong belief\" and didn't fear death. As the \"Jew mother figure\" she feels it is her obligation to protect her child. Her final act of affection in the movie is to kill her son before the Nazis can kill him. In an act of bravery and sacrifice she slaughters Ernst with a straight razor.\nErich is devastated by his mother's suicide. However, rather than being killed by the authorities because she killed her son, the \"Jew mother\" is instead imprisoned alongside her son. Erich now vows to avenge his mother's death.\nIn one of the next scenes, Erich is",
    "\"The Illusionist\" stars Edward Norton as the titular illusionist, a famous performer who performs magic tricks in the early years of the last century. After a long absence from his native France, he's on his way back to the country when he meets young apprentice and aspiring magician Sophie. They fall in love at first sight and follow through with it once she gets hired as his assistant. Things are happy for a while, but then events conspire to keep them apart until circumstances cause Sophie to leave her life and everything she's familiar with behind and find her true calling, both in life and love.\nIt's a shame that \"The Illusionist\" never really made the splash it merited. The film was one of the more talked-about pictures of 2006, but the buzz fizzled out, and it never fully became a breakout hit. The reason for that, I think, had more to do with the story than the film itself; although its premise promised something more than a wondrous little romance flick, it never delivers. Most of the film is indeed a romance between a famous stage illusionist in an early 1900s New York City and the innocent orphan who falls for him and becomes his assistant despite opposition from her father (a kind, kindly figure played by Paul Giamatti). And while I can't fault the story for having a somewhat familiar tale, I do fault it for being overly simplistic, and ultimately not giving enough satisfaction once it's over. What should have been a great character-driven tear-jerker was really just a lightweight fairy tale with some truly inspired touches.\nDirector Neil Burger definitely has plenty of style, and I like the look of the film a great deal. But he also has a penchant for letting his camera linger for too long on the occasional scene, and the movie often feels like a dreamy haze. A few well-done shots don't make up for several others that never really needed to be that long to begin with, and it gives the film an airy, almost casual feel at times when you'd kind of rather it be something more grounded and tangible for one of its genre. The story itself, as I said, is simple, and sometimes that can work in a movie's favor. Here, though, it becomes a problem, for the film relies on a number of key scenes that",
    "The Big Lebowski has become my favorite Coen brothers movie. It is filled with the most quotable lines that I have heard for a long time. The characters are rich, multidimensional, and memorable. The story is complex (with a few plot holes, I will admit), but is quite fun to follow nonetheless.\n\nThe movie is full of surprises, whether you're watching it for the first time, or the tenth. After viewing so many movies and even many Coen brothers movies, I never expected to be as amused and amazed by The Big Lebowski as I was. I hope more people see this movie because I think there are some who would not know how much potential it has. The Big Lebowski is a classic, a movie that should be enjoyed long into the future. I hope you will watch it and enjoy it just as I have.\n\nIn Figure 1-12, you see the page from the website IMDb.com that is used to submit these film reviews for review movies.\n\nFigure 1-12: Reviews of the film The Big Lebowski\n\nWhat's particularly valuable about the reviews in this system is that users can rate the movies that they review.

    "\"The story, based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg, centers on a boy who is not allowed to have Christmas that year because his parents are divorced. He wanders out to the Polar Express and, with other children, travels to meet the bearded Santa Claus at the North Pole. The film begins as the little boy lies in bed, dreaming of getting up to check on his Christmas List. However, his father comes and sits on him, waking him up and telling him that he isn't allowed to have Christmas this year. The boy sneaks out of the house and into a beautiful winter scene and he gets on The Polar Express. It's run by the conductor, the train engineer, and the hobo Santa. The Polar Express is full of boys and girls, and a stuffed tiger, all of whom are the same age as the boy in the story, so he feels at home. The Polar Express travels through various places, including a deep frozen forest, until it arrives at the polar North Pole. The boy and his friends come out of the Polar Express into The Ice Palace and are greeted by Mrs. Claus and Santa Claus. After being served milk and cookies, Santa gives the children a tour of his factory, while they wait for the presents from the North Pole's other factory to be filled and wrapped. After being warned about a broken heart, the boy's bell gets fixed and everyone boards the Polar Express again. Suddenly, the train comes to a halt and the boy sees Santa and Mrs. Clinton running. The girl at the end of the train was just getting her present, and her Christmas wish got heard. The North Pole was in danger of being completely destroyed by people who wanted to see Christmas forever. The people were stopped by the Polar Bear, who lives with his cub in the mountains next to the North Pol.

    "There are a number of things that will make you say \"that was so cool\" while viewing Back to the Future II, and then you reach the point where you're saying \"How did they do that?\" Well, it's a little of both, with a dollop of clever creativity added into the mix.\nRobert Zemeckis, Bob Gale and the other creative fellows at Amblin Entertainment followed their success (not to mention critical respect) with a little film called Back to the Future and gave birth to a series that had an enormous following. With this film came that great little theme song and those great little Doc Brown shoes, so there was no question they'd ride it as long as they could. That they managed to ride it so well with this sequel is more than anyone could have reasonably hoped.\nWhere they've cleverly used the sequel to not only add an additional twist on the original, but to expand in ways that not only add to the story they'd first introduced us to, but a whole new one as well, and to do it all in such a way as to not only expand their original, but add more dimensions at the same time.\nThe idea of sending Marty forward into the future (as well as the alternate one of 1985 from part one) is actually a great premise (and for that matter, the story of \"Tru Story\" takes on a new twist as we learn what happened after we met him in 1989) for the premise of creating a time travel world where anything could be possible and the possibilities seemed infinite, with this twist making us think about a possible way to deal with the paradoxes of time travel.\nThe film is full of fun in the process, bringing us an expanded future, and giving us the familiar gang of characters we last saw in 1985, including the always great Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown, and now giving us a real treat by adding Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen's future self. He's so different from the other characters we'd seen in 1985, but the part of Biff was certainly one he was born to play. Then there was the delight of watching George McFly and Lorraine McFly get a whole new chance to give a new direction to their relationship together. It is a really fun movie to watch. And of course, you get to see Doc Brown in 1985 once again",
    "You've probably heard all of the jokes about this movie's convultaed plot before and I won't bore you with them all (even though there are a few more you don't know). But what it all boils down to is that if you think it's convulted then you're paying way too much attention. If you're going to look for plot holes, you'd be more likely to find them in something on tv. The important thing to know about this movie is that the plot was used as a vehicle for comedy. It is a comedy. Not an action picture, a comedy. Hitchcock is one of the masters at using comedy to great effect. It doesn't matter if he didn't have the best cast out there, Cary Grant did almost everything on his own anyway. So all you Cary Haters out there, stick your heads back in the sand like you normally do. When he doesn't have the time or money to pull it off, the acting isn't that great and you'll see it. But \"North By Northwest\" is more like a really funny TV episode with a really big budget. Just like a TV episode, the acting here is usually pretty well done. And you don't hear anyone else say: \"Wait, how did he get there so fast?\" It's just really funny and well done. Oh, and it's one of Hitch's own favorite movies and he's one of the greats - so take that!\nPosted by A.

    "\"Rocky is about a young man named Rocky Balboa who, against all odds, fights his way out to the middleweight championship of the world. The film details his humble, underprivileged existence on the edges of society, his accidental and ultimately doomed involvement with Adrian, and his development, against all odds, into the champion of the world.\nI found Rocky to have an interesting story to tell. This movie was not without its flaws. In a recent DVD release of the movie, there appears to be a few changes to the original. If you've seen this movie before, you'll notice the obvious changes to the music and a few of the scenes in the beginning. Some of the scenes with Rocco and Rocky are also a little different now. These changes are good, because they make the movie more enjoyable. However, if you're looking for a great movie, this may not be for you.\nI was also surprised to see that Rocky didn't make it to the end of the movie. I found it weird, because I thought he was going to make a comeback at the end of the movie. If you like this movie, then you may want to give it a try. There is not a lot of action in this movie, so if you're a big fan of that type of movie, you may not want to wait for the sequel.\nI rate this movie a solid 8/10 stars, because it is a good movie with some great performances. I was also surprised at how realistic the characters were. I think that's part of the reason I give it a solid 8/10. I also think that it is a good movie for anyone who is interested in boxing, as it shows some great training scenes. It is a good movie for all of us, but I think that the fans of boxing and the drama fans will love it. I don't know if it is the best movie of its genre, but I think it is a good movie.\nI think it is very interesting to see how the story develops. I think it is very important to see how the story is developed. I think the story is very important because the movie is very realistic. This is a very realistic story and I think the story is very important. This is a very realistic movie and I think the story is very important.\nIt is very important to see how this movie is told.",
    "I saw this movie when I was 5 and I didn't stop laughing. It is certainly not for little kids. There is language and violence (a lot of it) and I have seen my five year old cousin watching it and cringing from fear. Macaulay Culkin does a fantastic job as Kevin, but be sure he is not watching with you. The scene with the two burglars chasing Kevin on the skateboards and him swinging the baseball bat is one of my favorite Kevin moments.\nBut back to the review: A funny holiday film.\nThe plot: A young boy named Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) is staying all alone at home for an entire week and his relatives are out of town. The boy believes nobody else has noticed he's not in the house, so he thinks it is up to him to protect it.\nWhile Kevin is away on an errand, two thieves named Marv and Harry (Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci) invade his house and attempt to rob it. But their plans are foiled by Kevin who plans on getting some revenge for the trouble.\nMy comment after reading this review:\nI was reminded of my youth while I read this review and I couldn't stop giggling. My son loved \"Home Alone\" when he was older, until he had to stay home alone to babysit and learned what it was like. I remember when our house was burglarized, my dad, the kids, and I stayed at our neighbor's house. It was a scary thing, especially since the burglar gained entry into our house by busting down our sliding glass door. It was horrible, especially since my mom had a lot of jewelry. I never would have believed we would have the problems we did. Thank God those guys didn't come in during the daytime when my kids or I were home or I shudder to think what they might have tried to do.\nI thought \"Home Alone\" was one of the funniest movies ever made, if only because I could remember back when I had to stay alone to babysit and I just didn't have a lot of freedom as a kid. It was nice to think of Macaulay Culkin being in his home alone to have any freedom whatsoever.\nBy the way, this was the first movie I remember seeing Macaulay Culkin in after I loved",

Bob is desperate to escape the memories of the past when he is recalled to the scene of an assassination attempt on the President and ends up hunting a killer known as Shooter--a man Bob has every reason to suspect and not a few to fear--but finds that in a world without heroes, the line between hero and villain is vanishing",
    "\"The movie opens with its eponymous character (Will Smith) falling from the sky to cause a huge mess and crash directly into a building, killing dozens of people. Flash forward fifteen years: Hancock is now a depressed, alcoholic hermit hiding away in an abandoned warehouse and doing his damnedest to be as uncharismatic and unlikable as humanly possible, but when L.A. finally catches on fire because of it he decides it's time for an image makeover so he can be seen as a hero by the masses again.\nUnfortunately the first two-thirds of this movie are as boring as they are unfunny, and though it does pull through by the end to provide a reasonable, though by no means spectacular conclusion I feel I must rate more or less the entire movie as a single entity, and considering the slow and mostly-unfunny build-up from here I can only see three things to truly recommend this movie as being worth one's time and money.\n1) Hancock himself: Smith as the main character of a movie for the first time ever gets to actually do an alien/hero/antihero kind of thing here that he's always wanted to do but he's always chosen the more realistic and comedic characters in the past over that. His character can be very likable and amusing as long as you just overlook the fact that you have to forgive him in nearly every scene for being a total jerk and a complete douche to anyone not rich and important with the possible exception of those very rare instances where he's showing off or does something to make himself look cooler or more entertaining or whatever.\n2) Jason Bateman as the PR manager: Bateman was excellent as the only halfway decent person in the movie. His timing was perfect and his relationship with Hancock, both comic and dramatic, was just as strong as it could be. I can say here that I felt like his character represented Will Smith's friend Jaden Smith in some regards, especially having the same first name. However I would love to find out where the writers got the idea to have Jason Bateman play the PR manager, and if they did so on purpose, though obviously his character is fictional, what he was meant to represent.\n3) Visual effects: The movie had a lot of really awesome-looking effects, not just the various special effects but also in the way of the",

    "\"The characters in Win Win are the kind of sad sacks I've come to expect from actor/director Alexander Payne, best known for side-splitting comedy, such as Election and Sideways. Win Win is a drama that deals with addiction and depression and the power of family and friendship.\nWhile not the kind of movie that will make one laugh out loud, Win Win is nevertheless an enjoyable work of dramatic fiction that highlights the power of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The film focuses on two people who have hit rock bottom in their lives: Terry, a disgruntled lawyer, desperate to hang onto the house on which his financial security rests, and Mike, a former All-Star wrestler gone to seed, who has to contend with a new stepson who could very well derail his marriage if he doesn't find a more productive way of spending his time besides sitting in front of the television screen and drinking. Terry and Mike need some kind of a miracle, one that only money can bring, and the film's story follows their mutual path to winning a contest that will provide the needed cash. The movie is a bit simplistic and sometimes feels like an episode of Oprah. In fact, it might have been funnier if the film had an Oprah voice over (or even better, an Ellen voice over) to talk to the viewers about the many issues the narrative raises.\nWin Win isn't as good as Payne's 2007 dramedy About Schmidt, but it is certainly worth a look as he makes a solid transition from comedy to more serious fare.\"\nWin Win is the new movie from Academy Award nominated actor, director and writer Alexander Payne. Starring Academy Award nominee Bradley Cooper and Paul Giamatti, it is a film about rediscovery, second chances, and the power of family and friendship. It is Payne's seventh feature film, and the first without actor Jim Taylor, and the first to earn a PG-13 rating as opposed to the R rated ones that had preceded it. It is the third collaboration between Cooper and Payne, and the sixth time Giamatti has worked with the director since Scent of a Woman in 1992. The film screened at the New York Film Festival in 2011, prior to a limited theatrical release in North America on January 13, followed by a wide release on January 27, 2012.\nIt opens with Mike Flaherty (Paul",
    "Atonement is based on the novel of the same name by Ian McEwan. It tells the story of Cecilia, a young girl at the turn of the 20th century, who has aspirations of becoming a writer. She and her wealthy cousin, Briony, are spending their summer together at their family estate surrounded by their other cousins, including Robbie Turner, Briony's special friend.\nBriony is obsessed with writing stories, but the truth is that she does not know much about the world, including love, men and women. This is where her special friend, Robbie, comes in, providing an educated, more experienced perspective to Briony's romantic desires.\nCecilia has had quite enough of her cousin's romantic notions to last her a lifetime and would much rather concentrate on reading or writing, but with the addition of a new cook and housekeeper, a young servant named Paul, the cousins are left alone and with a lot of time on their hands.\nOn one occasion Cecilia has become tired of Robbie's talk of love and desire, and runs off to play \"hide-and-seek\" with some of the other cousins on the property. As a child she had a reputation of being able to hide quite well and would often run off and play the game with Briony, the two children being in competition with each other as to who could hide the best. This time she runs off and starts hiding but becomes lost on the estate, wandering into the forbidden part of the property that is home to the family's housekeeper and cook.\nWandering into the servants' quarters, she is caught by a jealous housekeeper, who calls a young man in the household, Jack, to come in and find her. Paul, the servant girl, who has been helping Cecilia up to this point, also follows along to the servants' quarters, but unbeknown to her, Jack decides to punish Cecilia for her disobedience. He then takes her to the small pool in the servants' quarters and throws her in, before running off to play with the other children in Robbie's room.\nAs Cecilia is left alone by the side of the pool, she is seen by Robbie as he passes by the small window in her hiding place. She appears in distress, lying in a crumpled heap by the side of the",
    "The plot is good for most intents and purposes, but there are a couple things that don't exactly line up when you pay attention:\nI will not tell you what that is, because what I am going to discuss is about the most profound moment in the movie, but instead, I'm going to mention something about one of the main characters:\nMathematics is a subject that you either care about, get or understand or not. And this character here is a perfect example of that. She cares about mathematics, gets it and understands everything in a way that is above and beyond what the rest of us can ever understand, and as a result, she comes to a very hard conclusion, which is that there exists what seems to us humans as an infinite possibility, but for her, there is very little if any hope of a solution to something. And the thing I want you to take from this is that when it comes to certain subjects, those of us who don't know how to do them, are never going to understand other people who do know how to do them. And as a result, if you find yourself in a situation where people around you are making decisions based on that subject you don't understand, you should try to understand their reasons as best as you can and just go ahead and believe them, even if you don't understand them.\nSo what does that have to do with our present situation? Well, we have people around us who know very little about math and statistics such as the people at Trump University or the people at the National Security Council, or the people on CNN, or the rest of the media who think that the idea of a lockdown is an effective way to deal with this virus, and on the other end of things, we have people who know the data and statistics, and know how this virus works and know that the data and statistics are real, but then those people aren't taken seriously because they are \"just numbers\" - not \"real\" data.\nYou are either making your decisions based on data and statistics, or you are basing them on other things that you do not completely understand and cannot defend. Either way, you are going to be letting people tell you what to do. The only difference here is that some people think that they know the data and statistics and know that what the people around them say is wrong, and other people think that they",
    "V for Vendetta is set in a futuristic totalitarian England (now known as \"Great Britain\" again) in which a restrictive police state and authoritarian party has crushed personal freedom. Under this new regime, there is no more religion and it is illegal to have more than one child.\nAfter a decade of this reign, a shadowy, masked revolutionist named \"V\" has inspired a following, including Evey Hamilton, a young woman who is coerced by the party to relay V's speeches and messages. Her life changes forever when V rescues her from being abused and raped. He asks her to help him distribute his messages, leading her to a network of secret followers. It's soon revealed that V is planning his most daring move yet, with the help of Evey, who begins to fall in love with her captor...\nThis movie definitely raises questions concerning ethics, but I'm not sure how the answers provided in the film are the best way to handle them. I recommend the film (though it is very long, it's worth it for the ending!), but I can't say that it does a very good job of answering questions about political or human rights, and it also does not do a good job of providing compelling reasons to take a particular attitude concerning the treatment of others. A little bit of the first issue will be dealt with in a future post entitled 'The Cost of Truth' which considers the morality of hiding reality from others vs. allowing them all of the information they might want. The problem with the second issue (about providing compelling reasons to take particular attitudes, such as why I should believe that all citizens are born with inalienable rights or that it is wrong to torture and kill others) comes about in this film from a variety of places. Some of the characters do act with good motives and have a good understanding of the rights people should have, but there are other places where this film has fallen short of creating a more well-rounded analysis. In my next post, I begin to explore the issue of whether any kind of rights should be granted to criminals. If anyone is interested, the next part will cover the movie \"Seven\" starring Kevin Spacey and Brad Pitt. I will try to see the movie Ichi the killer sometime soon.\nPractice is required to become proficient in most endeavors — whether this is music, dance",

The storyline of the movie focuses on Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America and other subjects related to the Marvel Universe.\nThe character of Steve Rogers was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Rogers was a frail WW2 American teenager in the comics who is chosen by the U.S. military in 1941 to undergo Operation Rebirth so that he could be injected with a \"super-serum\" that turned him into a perfect Captain America. The super-hero has been a popular one and has been a main character in various comic book series and a subject of film adaptations.\nThe film starts off with a young Steve Rogers during his childhood and the hardships he lives with in the movie. He works part time as a janitor in order to help his mom and his poor family. He is a lonely individual and wants to join the Navy due to the influence of his late father, Joe. His mother does not allow this for fear of losing her only child during WW2.\nThe story then skips ahead to 1942 and we witness Rogers getting the opportunity to join the US Army, but his physical condition is very poor and his chances of survival in the war is minimal. An organization known as Operation Rebirth gets into the act and Rogers receives the serum and undergoes intense physical training. The procedure is a success and Rogers becomes perfectly muscular and physically fit as a result.

    "\"When Danny Boyle (the director) introduced a fresh new and exciting vision in \"Shallow Grave\" (1994), I thought he may be the perfect candidate to direct \"Trainspotting\" (1996). But that movie has some fatal flaws. I am not trying to put \"Shallow Grave\" down but for me, it was a film which was not worth a second viewing. However, when I watched \"Trainspotting\", I felt as if it was a movie that I did not want to miss a second time. The only thing I disliked were the slow moments in the film which was to be expected with a film like this. The cast is magnificent with many actors doing a great job. Ewan McGregor gives a memorable performance. I have actually said that I didn't want to miss this film for a second time because I felt that by watching it a second time you would probably find something new to say about it. I was right.

    "Sultan is a simple man who believes that a person must take responsibility for his or her actions regardless of the consequences. He is a true leader and a brave man.\nSultan is a classic example of what we can expect from a movie made in Bollywood. He is a master at being a character, and when it comes to romance, he is one of the best.\nThe movie starts with Sultan, along with his best friend, getting shot by a gangster. This is a good moment in the movie, as it shows that Sultan is not afraid to confront his enemy.\nSultan was not a very good person in his life, but when he had a chance to save his friend, he took it. He did not hesitate for even a moment, but went straight to the killer and took him out. It is a good moment for Sultan, which shows how he has changed.\nThe movie ends with Sultan and his friend becoming friends, while getting married to the beautiful woman from his childhood. They live happily ever after, and the movie ends with a happy ending.\nSultan is a very good movie. The acting is great, the music is very nice, the story is very good, and the movie has a happy ending. I highly recommend this movie, and give it two thumbs up.\nThis is one of my favorite Indian films. The acting is incredible, and the characters are all so well-developed. The film is beautifully shot in black and white. The music is well done, and the songs are catchy and unique. The story is very moving, and the film is very well made. The only complaint I have is that the film is too long. The film is about two hours and forty minutes, and I had to watch it five times to really appreciate it. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who loves Indian films. It would be a shame if this film was not made. It is not for everyone, but it is a very enjoyable film to watch.\nI was looking forward to watching this film for a while. I was expecting something like the other films by the director, but I was surprised to see the film turn out to be a comedy film. It was a very entertaining film. The director was able to make the film flow well, and the story was good too. The acting was very good, and the film was very well done.",

    "\"In this movie, the protagonist, Alfred Hitchcock, was attempting to create the perfect blend of horror, murder, suspense, and film. The director of the show was himself; I do not know of any other show that had the director also be the director of the show. He would later create other works that would top this, but in total, Psycho is the number one movie.\n\nWhen you watch the show you will notice several small things that I found a lot of fun. First, there is the fact that all the actors' eyes, especially Vera Miles' are in the same direction. Another great thing is the shower scene where Vera Miles is wearing no make up and you see her naked body.\n\nBut my favorite thing in this movie was the fact that Hitchcock directed the film. He decided to do things different than most directors, and I found it to be interesting and fun to see. One of the scenes is where the girl kills herself. Instead of just playing some music and having the character kill himself, Hitchcock had actors playing instruments while Vera Miles was killing himself. It was very unique compared to the other films I watched.\n\nHowever, I did not like that the girl was killing himself. I thought if she was going to kill herself then she should have. This is kind of hard because she was very pretty, but it was not her fault. Hitchcock had decided that she should not be the one to kill herself. Although he did not have it his way, I think it would have been a bad idea.\n\nThis was very hard to do, but after some thought\n\nI found that the director needed to be involved in the film. After watching the film I thought he could have made the movie a lot better if he had directed the film himself.\n\nAt the end of the movie, I was able to look back and see how amazing the film really was. I thought about how the people who watched the film probably did not notice the tiny mistakes in the film, but they would have noticed the mistakes if I had made a mistake.

    "In this film, we find that the planet-sized alien robot war has been going on for several thousand years. In each movie, a small fraction of the robots on Earth have come to see our world for what it is: A barren wasteland devoid of any technological advancement that is inhabited mostly by a sub-species of human primitives, with little chance of survival, even in groups as large as four persons. We know this because in each film we see them trying to leave Earth. And the aliens always tell them, no go. But, of course, they all ignore these dire warnings and ultimately end up dead.In the first movie, the Decepticons invade Earth and kill thousands of people, yet are ultimately unsuccessful in their mission to find and use Allspark or they all would have died... or not.In the second movie, the aliens return to Earth and the Autobots are so eager to help the humans, they allow themselves to be killed on the battlefield instead of leaving Earth. I mean, they could have flown up into outer space and made it to Alpha-Centauri and set up new colonies in Alpha Centauri 3, 4, 13, 14, or 15.I mean, all these intelligent robots and all that time and they can't come up with a way to establish a base on the next planet to ours? Really?!In this film, all the humans are working together in a coalition designed to fight the war with the Decepticons, even though only the Americans have any real weapons. All the other governments have sent them guns, but the Americans are the only ones with any bullets. It's funny how that works.So the story goes. They have to fight the war with giant robots on their side, so the humans have to provide the money and the guns. And the aliens have to keep fighting until all the resources are depleted and everything else is destroyed.I'm going to call this story a \"human story\" because in this movie there are humans. Not in the first two. There, the humans were merely there to witness the events, maybe to die, and to ultimately become the next group of aliens, I assume.Anyway, the whole reason for the war is that the Decepticons have the Allspark on board their spaceship and they need it to take over the world, so they have to get it.",

    "\"Conjured up from the dark inner recess of hellish thoughts and an eternal nightmares \"Constantine\" is a movie that has more of a cult following than it does an actual following for it isn't the most memorable of movies and is more than likely the movie that caused Keanu Reeves fan base to decrease by at least half of what it had been when he was in \"The Matrix\".\nAs an adaptation of the comic book \"Hellblazer\" \"Constantine\" is about the man himself John Constantine (who is played by \"The Matrix\" star Keanu Reeves in perhaps his darkest performance ever) who is an alcoholic, smokes excessively, gambles at high stakes, and is cursed, among other things. John is hired by the father of a young woman (Shia LeBeouf) whose soul is trapped inside an evil entity's body. John's path to save her and rid the world of the demon turns complicated as he finds out that he can't do it all on his own.\nAll of the performances, especially Keanu Reeves' are really good and that is a testament to what he does here as well as the writing, which is probably the film's strongest trait. The story makes John Constantine likeable even though he would probably be an outright psychopath if it were in another movie.\nI actually think that the movie is underrated and not just because of how it treats Keanu Reeves, and as someone who has actually read the comic book I like to see my favorite character brought to the screen and if anything it was a start. I recommend this to people who read the \"Hellblazer\" comic book and want to see it brought to the big screen even though I can say that there are probably better versions of the material out there, but as a whole \"Constantine\" is one of the best superhero movies that has ever been made.

The film reminds me a great deal of \"Species\", my favorite alien horror film of all time.\nMost of the film is spent in the dark, claustrophobic caves. The creatures are frightening (I especially thought the baby cave monsters were especially scary), and there are some truly disgusting moments. There are also some great suspenseful and humorous moments. One woman (Ashley) was not very pleasant or believable, and is clearly the \"victim,\" yet you don't want her to be killed. This is what makes the film interesting.\nSome sequences are incredibly tense; if you have been caving, you will appreciate the realism. \"The Descent\" is the ultimate in suspense horror films. And the best part about this feature film is that, if you did not love it, like many horror films today, you are not alone. You are among millions who have loved it as much as I did.\nThe women and the creature are equal: equal in brutality and equal in intelligence. The women, while initially confident, are also flawed, and that is why we can relate to them even though they are fictional. Most important, there is no heroine. So there is no unrealistic and false sense of false power created by some female who will save all in the movie's last act.\nIf there are any other questions that I might answer to ease one's mind and assist one with a decision about whether to see this film, feel free to ask.\"\nPosted by Joe Powell at 4:41 PM 2 comments:",
    "Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, this German film retells, from many different perspectives and through much of it from Hitler's own perspective, the final days of Germany's Hitler and how the Germans of the 20th century were deceived into a fate so terrible that the world had to become a very different and much more serious place as a consequence of their beliefs.\n\nThe film makes no excuse for Hitler's politics and the damage he did because of them, yet is fascinating in showing how he was able to do so. Hitler is the personification of the people he was working for, and his charisma and cunning are revealed here through a brilliant and very believable performance by Bruno Ganz. The audience is taken on a roller-coaster ride with a brilliant storyline, revealing many secrets of the final days that until now have never been revealed. The film begins in a somewhat slow fashion as the story of the rise of Hitler is recounted, which is a prelude to the main action, but the film is well worth the wait as it culminates with the drama of those last days in the Berlin bunker as Hitler seeks to justify his life and his actions.\n\nThe performances and the dialogue are superb and the storyline gripping throughout the film. It is difficult to imagine an actor as right for the part of Hitler as Bruno Ganz and this film will be remembered and admired for generations to come.\n\nI do not recommend this movie for students or viewers who are easily upset by strong references to Nazi actions.\n\n#### _Chapter Four_\n\n### NOVICE WRITER'S RESPONSE TO _DOWNFALL_\n\nThis is a good response that shows a detailed understanding of the plot and the issues presented in the movie. This response also shows excellent paragraphing, strong diction and grammar, and careful sentence structure. The use of subheads as a transition device to introduce new topics is well executed.\n\n**Downfall**\n\nHitler is portrayed in the movie _Downfall_ as being a cunning charismatic leader. Throughout the movie there are many flashbacks to the history of Hitler's rise to power. People follow him because he is charismatic and he is a personification of the people. He used his skills to manipulate and deceive people. He was a highly intelligent man. The film shows how Hitler can deceive an audience",
    "\"The Deepwater Horizon oil rig burns in the Gulf of Mexico after an explosion on April 20, 2010 which resulted in 11 deaths on the rig and the largest marine oil spill in history.\nThe story centers on Mike Williams (MarkWahlberg), an electrician on the oil rig who survives the explosion, which is caused by a gas leak from a faulty seal on a BOP oil well head. This is the worst disaster in the history of drilling in the gulf as well as the largest single oil spill ever.\nAll actors give excellent performances, especially KurtRussell, John Malkovich, Gina Rodriguez, Kate Hudson, DylanO’Brian, and JohnBeasley, the real life characters that survive the explosion and the subsequent oil spill.\nFor a movie based on a real life incident, there may not be enough drama in the actual event to justify a movie, but with solid acting from all the cast, it works fine in this film.\nI was surprised by the amount of detail put into the actual explosion, and the ensuing oil spill. If there was any editing done, I didn’t notice it. I especially liked the footage showing the oil spreading across the water as time passes. This was probably done with special effects, CG or otherwise, but it was impressive and showed the magnitude of the ecological disaster which happened by the leaking oil. I also liked how at the last the director focused on a Gulf of Mexico shore, showing the ocean in front of a beach which is destroyed, covered in oil. The final scene emphasizes the seriousness of the events that happen in this film.\nAll in all I really liked this movie and thought it did a great job of showing how a series of mistakes in the deep water drilling sector caused the largest marine oil spill in the gulf. There are many lessons to be learned from this disaster, as noted at the close of the film. I enjoyed the movie for showing this true story in a realistic way. My rating: 7.5/10.\"\nI am sure this is a very realistic telling of the event, but the review seems a little biased towards the cast performances since it starts off stating that the review centers on the characters. I think that such a review should start off with a more general summary of the movie, then go into detail about the characters and the actors who portray them. My rating for this review: 6",
    "\"It was nice to see a movie that was a straight forward story with such great acting and a very well directed movie. It is not all done in camera action scenes as the story is mainly told by the soldier and the one they are guarding. For this reason it really allows for the viewers to understand the complexity and the intensity of the situation.\nThis movie has very little dialogue and I think that this is the best use of what they did have. As for the story, I felt that this was very realistic of what was going on and some very real things are shown that happen. They also made sure that they showed the difference of what the Americans and the Iraqis thought about the situation, and their differences.\nThe acting is so natural and the cast could not do a better job. Jeremy Renner's character makes you laugh at times but also brings a very real understanding of our military members. I liked the fact that he did not try to make his character a war hero and did not try to make him anything he wasn't. It really spoke to how the real soldiers feel in these situations. Anthony Mackie had a tough character but he gave a very good performance because it really is not all that different than the soldiers that we have in the military right now. I liked how he showed the different characters of the soldiers who were in this situation and how they reacted.\nFor the Iraqis, I did not fully understand their motives, but overall they did the best work they could in the circumstances.\nThe directing was amazing and you know that Kathryn Bigelow knows how the military thinks. The scenes where they are in combat are so real and believable. I was really taken by how realistic this movie was. You feel like you are there with the characters and you can see what they feel during these scary missions.\nYou see how they worry and how they work the situation when things are wrong and you feel it on the inside when they get hit. I think that this movie is one of the best that has come out of Iraq and it shows the situation of what soldiers in all branches go through by risking their lives for us, the Americans. I would definitely see this again because it will make you appreciate more of the work our military members do for us to keep us free and to protect us.\"\n(Read complete IMDb.com review)\nLabels",

    "Annie Hall (1977)\nAnnie Hall is the definitive Woody Allen movie. In it Woody Allen (alias Alvy Singer) and Diane Keaton (alias Annie Hall) are the leading characters portraying lovers. The movie portrays the ups and downs of their relationship through funny scenes and humorous dialogues. The movie is set in NYC in the 70s, and the whole movie revolves around the relationship of their characters. The best scenes are the scenes during the opening and the end credits.\nThe movie is also the most iconic Woody Allen movie that can be compared to his earlier works. The scenes portray him as a neurotic, nervous, fearful, and timid. The movie’s whole plot revolves around his fear of being without Annie, not knowing what he will do if this occurs. When Annie Hall ends, he returns home. As Annie prepares to leave, Woody Allen says, “You can’t leave me like this, I’m not the same person anymore”; it is clear from this sentence that the relationship has completely changed him, which happens in all relationships.\nThere are two other themes expressed in the movie that were the same as Woody Allen’s earlier works. One theme that is expressed throughout the movie is the need for a sense of place. In this scene, Alvy is going through Annie Hall’s house. As he walks around the house, he points to Annie’s bedroom: “I had a dream once where I was in here, and the bed had just melted, you know”. He then goes on to tell her that this was before the days when she changed bedsheets and they still had the same sheets on. This scene explains how they still had not moved in together and were just living in her house.\nThe second theme that can be seen throughout the movie is the idea that love is a journey. As the movie progresses, it shows how it changes both of them; in the end, they realize how much they love each other. In the scene at the club, when Annie notices Alvy looking at her, she walks over to him, and he looks into her face. Annie then states “We’re going to get married, right?” Alvy responds “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you, but I’m pretty sure”.\nThe themes I find the funniest",

    "There is a lot of action in this film and if it is not an action sequence, there will be one just down the road. Some parts are very realistic and others are more of a comical, tongue-in-cheek humor. Keanu Reeves does a fantastic job in this sequel with John Wick. He is a very strong character and you feel the pain he experiences and the heartache that comes along. He really gets into the character and it shows. I would say this is one of the rare times that a sequel beats the original. The fact that they were able to get this many stars and keep them interested in the story to work is an accomplishment. I would definitely recommend seeing this film, as it will probably be the best way to introduce John Wick to a new generation of fans.\nI watched the film about twenty times and it was as good as the first. It was a good story of how the people of America are trying to live with the new laws. This movie is an action packed movie that is one to see. I will keep this in my DVD collection.\nI am not a big fan of the original John Wick. This film is the second one of the Wick franchise and it is a very satisfying film. The film is a good action film and it is also a good film to watch with your family. It has a good story, a great cast, good fight scenes, good dialogue, good special effects and good characters. It is a great film to watch with your family.\nI liked this movie and I think people should watch it. If you are not a fan of the movie, then watch it with your family. I think it is a good movie.\nI watched this film and it was amazing. It was so well made, it really showed what the world is like today and it really shows how people can be cruel to each other. I think this film can be watched by people who have seen the film before, because it shows how a man can be really cruel.\nI'm one of those people who liked the first film but not the second one. It's not a must watch. I'm also a big fan of Keanu Reeves and this new John Wick film is definitely not the best John Wick movie of recent times. It's still good though. It's a sequel that doesn't need to be made. It doesn",
    "The following is the full text of a review for the movie \"Mudbound\" from Rotten Tomatoes.com:\nThe following is the full text of a review for the movie \"Mudbound\" from The New York Times:\nSet in the Deep South during the years following World War II, MUdBOUND is a masterly depiction of African Americans as they try to move forward as individuals and together after their great struggle.\nMUdBOUND opens as a young man is returning from World War II and in a car crash. This sets the tone for the movie which is both violent and poignant.\nIt is a powerful picture that shows not only an epic struggle between the black and white races in a small southern town, but illustrates the emotional battle waged in the hearts and minds of individuals trying to overcome the traumas inflicted on them.\nThe movie is about both races but is centered mainly on the black protagonists, Hap (Jason Mitchell) and Ronsel Jackson (Jason Mitchell), and their struggle to forge a life of liberty amidst the shackles of racism.\nThe movie, based on the award-winning novel by Hillary Jordan, is set in rural Mississippi during the years following the second World War.\nHap is the youngest member of his family to return home after the war, but he is not welcomed by Jackson, the family patriarch.\nRonsel Jackson is a middle-aged man who owns a farm, but his true pride in life is his family.\nWhen Hap arrives, he feels he should be in charge because he had made the highest military grade.\nHe is unable to accept the fact that he's not the oldest son and therefore not the natural leader.\nThe black race, both in the South and even in the United States, was not granted any opportunities for advancement or promotion.\nAs an example of this, the black soldiers and airmen who fought bravely in World War II as part of the United States military were not able to use the veterans' homes, or even eat in the same restaurants as white people.\nHap and Ronsel have a volatile relationship and the movie follows in great dept the two men's emotional journey to find common ground.\nHap eventually comes to an understanding with James and their relationship turns positive.\nTheir journey to overcome racism and hatred is movingly illustrated in the film",
    "Ridley Scott has the vision and the talent to transform what could have been just another sword and sandal movie into a truly epic, breathtaking film that is visually stunning and emotionally involving.\nI can safely say that Gladiator is, hands down, my favorite film of the summer. In many ways, Gladiator seems far removed from Scott's previous efforts - Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Blackhawk Down, etc - and yet I think what they all have in common is an attention to detail and visual nuances that is rarely seen in contemporary cinema. Gladiator offers the same attention to detail in the battle scenes and character interaction as it does the lavish costumes and set designs. All of the elements in the film contribute to the final product, which is a seamless integration of every aspect of film-making. My mind was kept focused and engaged throughout the entire film.\nDirected by Ridley Scott\nMusic: Lisa Gerrard & Hans Zimmer\nStarring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Tomas Arana\nBudget: 120,000,000\nRelease date: 17 May 2000\nThe acting is top-notch, with Russell Crowe giving us his best performance since The Insider. Joaquin Phoenix, at the beginning of a promising career, is believable in his portrayal of the tormented son. Connie Nielsen (Michael Mann's The Insider) is stunning and graceful as Lucilla, a woman used to getting her way and playing the manipulative seductress while never revealing her true feelings. Derek Jacobi has a small, memorable part as Gracchus, Commodus' loyal advisor. The supporting cast is made up of solid character actors.\nOliver Reed, in his final role before his death, is a formidable presence as Maximus' second-in-command Proximo - the old soldier who understands his men and doesn't allow the higher-ups to get in the way of a battle plan. Richard Harris is wonderfully over-the-top as the demented Emperor Commodus. Derek Jacobi has a small role as Commodus' advisor, Gracchus. One look at the cast list, and you can see that Scott surrounded himself with first-",
    "#### Bolt is Awesome!!\n\n **Reviewed by jonnydrums-1 November 17, 2008**\n\n_Bolt_ is an awesome movie! It is rated G. It has the voices of John Travolta and Melanie Griffith. Bolt is a dog and Penny is a girl. I like it because Bolt thinks he's super. He thinks he has superpowers but he is just a dog that thinks he is super. Bolt thinks he can see the world like superman but he can not. Bolt is a white dog with lightning shaped marks. He has eyes in his back so he can see behind him. Penny is a red haired girl. She is really cute. Penny has a hamster named Rhino that she gets mad about easily.\n\nBolt thinks he is super because he watches TV all the time and he never leaves the place he lives. The other dogs in his living room think he is a legend. He thinks he's super when really he's just a dog. Bolt makes you feel kind of funny. You watch Bolt and say, \"How can a dog think he's super?\" The director is Byron Howard but the thing I like is the dog's voice. When Bolt yells \"I'm super\" he sounds like John Travolta. Bolt is not a good dog at the ending but he learns his lesson.\n\n_Bolt_ teaches children about responsibility. It also teaches that you need a good mom and a dad.\n\n_Bolt_ is a good movie. When you watch _Bolt_ you will have a good time. If you have seen the movie _Bolt_, you will have watched it before. It is pretty cool.\n\n#  A New Kind of Friendship\n\nAlthough the Internet is a great way to share information and get our needs met, it can also be dangerous. This story is a typical example.\n\nDori is an avid golfer and a member of an online community of players. She regularly engages other golfers with questions and comments about the game. There is a man who frequently posts messages that are helpful and encouraging, and Dori comes to look forward to his replies.\n\nOne day, Dori asks her new friend a personal question about his life. He responds by requesting a picture of her. She obliges.",
    "\"LOS ANGELES - It's been four years since director Nicolas Winding Refn last turned heads with his stylish yet brutal police thriller \"Bronson,\" but he's finally back at it with the action-filled thrill ride \"Drive,\" a taut tale of a mysterious loner getting mixed up in a life of crime.\nAfter losing his wife Irene (Carey Mulligan), stunt driver and mechanic \"Driver\" (Ryan Gosling) lives a solitary life and works as a getaway driver around Hollywood. But following a job that goes terribly wrong, resulting in a dead police officer, he seeks out Irene to explain his actions and win her back. Before he can get a chance, Driver is tasked with another mission. That's when he discovers that an eight-year-old boy (Kaden Leos), named Benecio, is involved. As the mystery behind a series of strange robberies unravels, the Driver has to find a way to balance his life and protect the boy.\nRefn has created another brilliant film, building on the foundation he laid for the audience with \"Bronson.\" He once again manages to keep an audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish with his compelling blend of action, suspense, thrills, horror, and melodrama. The plot, which is relatively simple, but still complex enough to be satisfying, provides a framework for an engrossing display of the director's skill as well as his talent as a writer.\nLike his films before, \"Drive\" is a masterpiece of style and substance. The script, which is based on a novel by James Sallis, is a well-constructed piece of material. It provides a thrilling ride of suspenseful moments that can't help but engage the viewer. While all of the individual elements are great, it's the way Refn puts them together that is the most impressive.\nThe most compelling aspect of the whole production is the lead character of Driver. The film takes its name from the character who doesn't say a lot, at least verbally. All that's known about him is that he drives cars and races them for fun or profit. But just because he's taciturn doesn't mean he doesn't have a personality. Driver has an intense, brooding demeanor that makes it easy to root for him. Audiences can't help the sympathy",
    "“Snatch” is a great comedic action drama. It stars Benicio Del Toro, Jason Stratham, Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina, Mickey Rourke and Daniel Craig. Written as something more serious, then becoming a comedy after the writers went to England to do research, the movie is a dark but funny action film.\nI’m normally not a fan of action films, but this is one of my favorites. It has all sorts of action, but not the usual stuff, it has a weird humor that makes me laugh hard, and it has a story that brings you on from beginning to end.\nThe movie is about a diamond thief that has just been released from prison and has to pull one last heist, but the heist has fallen onto the hands of a group of other criminals. One of the members is planning something big, and wants a few others in on it. But these others already are in on it. And what starts as a small deal soon turns into a huge battle with all sorts of people, all sorts of money, and all sorts of weapons. Each group of people comes at each other with a different view on different ways the deal should go down.\nThe movie is very violent and not for youngsters, but if you like action, violence, and a bit of humour, this movie is for you. My advice is watch it, and see what you think. This is definitely one of the best action movies ever made.\nI highly recommend this movie as a worthwhile, though slightly over-rated, film. The two lead characters, Benicio del Toro and Jason Stratham, are excellent, and the way they interact with each other and with the rest of the cast is simply flawless and highly entertaining. Mickey Rourke, playing Tommy \"Mastermind\" Cruden, is the main villain of the film. As with most of Mickey's performances, this one is a little over-the-top, but he does a fine job. Dennis Farina also does a fine job of playing the role of one of the main bad guys, Mr. Brown. This film is also full of humor, and the combination of Del Toro, Stratham, and Farina, along with some of the supporting characters is a good one. The acting of all involved is superb, especially Benicio, Jason, and Mickey.\nThe movie is",
    "This is a little gem that doesn't really receive the recognition or the press it deserves. Robert Townsend delivers a wonderful performance in this very underrated movie. There are some great supporting actors here as well. The premise is basically a guy falls overboard while attempting to cross Niagara falls in a barge. He's eventually rescued by a family of black folks who take him in. He winds up staying at their house and his relationship with the daughter becomes increasingly complicated as time goes on. The family is nice, though he's still suspicious of them and thinks they are only taking him in to get something in return. The two are eventually able to see past their personal issues however and grow to love each other. They marry and have his baby. The drama arises when things don't work out as planned in regards to the child's father. The movie then focuses on the son of a bitch and his actions towards this innocent girl. I wish I could tell you why, but to do so would only ruin the movie's plot. It's a pretty good action/drama that is not as well known as it should be. The film has been out on DVD for quite some time and is certainly worth checking out. There are some very nice moments as well that you will truly appreciate.\nHoney is available to watch or download on the following platforms:\nWatch or Download Honey\n\"Honey\" Critic Reviews\nWatch \"Honey\" full movie review:\n\"Honey\" is a touching tale about love, self-discovery, and the ultimate test of man's morality; the search for happiness in life. It's an inspirational story about the human spirit and how it triumphs over even the most impossible odds.\nI can't recommend this movie enough. It's a must-see for everyone, especially those who love the work of James McAvoy. And it's a must-see for anyone who needs a good cry every now and then.\nThis wasn't a movie I was really looking forward to seeing, but I'm glad I did. The cast is great, and the plot is both compelling and engaging. I was surprised by how well the story was told, and how well the characters developed. That's something I've rarely seen in a film.\nThis is a very well done film. The acting is good. The setting is beautiful. The characters are well developed. I highly recommend this film"
