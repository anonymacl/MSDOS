    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type.

To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection.

Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects.

    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions.

    "Many deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation involve a Fully\nConvolutional Neural Network (FCN) followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF)\nto carry out inference over an image.

We therefore suggest incorporating\ninto the inference algorithm additional higher-order potentials inspired by the\nway humans identify and localize parts. We incorporate two relations that were\nshown to be useful to human object identification - containment and attachment\n- into the energy term of the CRF and evaluate their performance on the Pascal\nVOC Parts dataset.

The model is trained jointly in a multi-task learning setting.\nIn this paper, we propose Mixed-Supervised Dual-Network (MSDN), a novel\narchitecture which consists of two separate networks for the detection and\nsegmentation tasks respectively, and a series of connection modules between the\nlayers of the two networks. These connection modules are used to transfer\nuseful information from the auxiliary detection task to help the segmentation\ntask.

    "  We introduce a high-level graphical framework for designing and analysing\nquantum error correcting codes, centred on what we term the coherent parity\ncheck (CPC).

We show how CSS codes form a subset of CPC codes and, more\ngenerally, how to compute stabilizers for a CPC code. As an explicit example of\nthis framework, we give a method for turning almost any pair of classical\n[n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code. Further, we give a simple\ntechnique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and\ndemonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally, we use the\ngraphical tools to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within\nCPC codes. As our framework gives a new tool for constructing small- to\nmedium-sized codes with relatively high code rates, it provides a new source\nfor codes that could be suitable for emerging devices, while its zx-calculus\nfoundations enable natural integration of error correction with graphical\ncompiler toolchains. It also provides a powerful framework for reasoning about\nall stabilizer quantum error correction codes of any size.\n",
    "Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional\nnetworks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling\nlayers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to\npredictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has\nattempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or\nMRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between\nobjects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these\nproblems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The\ndownside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than\ntraditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.\n  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk\nNetwork (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and\nspatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity.\nOur proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and\nsemantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk\nlayer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the\nnetwork. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix\nmultiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks\nand it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard\nback-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional\nparameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces\nan improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.",

So this can be understood as one\napplication of Floer theory and the theory of $\\infty$-categories in basic\ndifferential geometry. We also develop, based on this $\\infty$-categorical\nFukaya theory, some basic new integer valued invariants of smooth manifolds,\ncalled quantum obstruction. On the way we also construct what we call quantum\nMaslov classes, which are higher degree variants of the relative Seidel\nmorphism. This also leads to new applications in Hofer geometry of the space of\nLagrangian equators in $S^2$.\n",

    "Most progress in semantic segmentation reports on daytime images taken under\nfavorable illumination conditions. We instead address the problem of semantic\nsegmentation of nighttime images and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting\ndaytime models to nighttime without using nighttime annotations. Moreover, we\ndesign a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of\nsemantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum\nframework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night via\nlabeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively\ndarker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspondences for the\nreal images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel\nuncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic\nsegmentation, designed for adverse conditions and including image regions\nbeyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion;\n3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which comprises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920\nunlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts\nplus a set of 151 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created\nwith our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark to perform our novel\nevaluation. Experiments show that our guided curriculum adaptation\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real nighttime sets both\nfor standard metrics and our uncertainty-aware metric. Furthermore, our\nuncertainty-aware evaluation reveals that selective invalidation of predictions\ncan lead to better results on data with ambiguous content such as our nighttime\nbenchmark and profit safety-oriented applications which involve invalid inputs.",
    "  Granular materials do not flow homogeneously like fluids when submitted to\nexternal stress,but often form rigid regions that are separated by narrow shear\nbands where the material yields and flows. This shear localization impacts\ntheir apparent rheology, which makes it difficult to infer a constitutive\nbehaviour from conventional rheometric measurements. Moreover, they present a\ndilatant behaviour, which makes their study in classical fixedvolume geometries\ndifficult. These features led to perform extensive studies with inclined plane\nflows, which were of crucial importance for the development and the validation\nof the $\\mu(I)$ rheology. Our aim is to develop a method to characterize\ngranular materials with rheometrical tools. Using unusual rheometry\nmeasurements in an annular shear cell adapted from Boyer et al.

    "Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a\nnatural language expression.

To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective\nby decoupling it into a \"Locate-Then-Segment\" (LTS) scheme. Given a language\nexpression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding\ntarget image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object\nbased on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual\nfeatures to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model\ninteraction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with\nposition prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a\nlight-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly\neffective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+\nand +3.4% on RefCOCOg).

The method partitions a QLF image into segments of uniform texture and\nintensity called superpixels; every superpixel is statistically modeled as a\nrealization of a single 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) whose parameters\nare estimated; the superpixel is then assigned to one of three classes\n(background, biofilm, tooth substratum) based on the training set of data.

In this paper, a novel\napproach for clustering based image segmentation is proposed. Here, we give\nimportance on color space and choose lab for this task. The famous hard\nclustering algorithm K-means is used, but as its performance is dependent on\nchoosing a proper distance measure, so, we go for cosine distance measure. Then\nthe segmented image is filtered with sobel filter. The filtered image is\nanalyzed with marker watershed algorithm to have the final segmented result of\nour original image. The MSE and PSNR values are evaluated to observe the\nperformance.",
    "Class imbalance has emerged as one of the major challenges for medical image\nsegmentation. The model cascade (MC) strategy significantly alleviates the\nclass imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for\ncoarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this\nmethod leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation\namong the models. To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model,\ni.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better\nthan MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net\nintegrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists\nof shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific\nparameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively\noptimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design\nboth an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based\ntraining strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between\ntasks and design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can\nadaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the\ncategory-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing\nmethod is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most\nimpressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing\nset and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed approaches, we\nalso won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating\nteams. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/chenhong-zhou/OM-Net.",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks have driven substantial advancements in\nthe automatic understanding of images. Requiring a large collection of images\nand their associated annotations is one of the main bottlenecks limiting the\nadoption of deep networks. In the task of medical image segmentation, requiring\npixel-level semantic annotations performed by human experts exacerbate this\ndifficulty. This paper proposes a new framework to train a fully convolutional\nsegmentation network from a large set of cheap unreliable annotations and a\nsmall set of expert-level clean annotations. We propose a spatially adaptive\nreweighting approach to treat clean and noisy pixel-level annotations\ncommensurately in the loss function. We deploy a meta-learning approach to\nassign higher importance to pixels whose loss gradient direction is closer to\nthose of clean data. Our experiments on training the network using segmentation\nground truth corrupted with different levels of annotation noise show how\nspatial reweighting improves the robustness of deep networks to noisy\nannotations.",
    "Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely\napplied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively\nand be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a\ngood machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good\nmodel training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the\nperformance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the\nmachine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each\nprocedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training\ndata ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information\nfor the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each\nmodel or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model\ncapture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can\nprovide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible\nlocal optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in\nmachine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the\ndiversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically\nsummarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and\ninference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In\naddition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the\nmachine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing\nimaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation,\nobject detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some\nchallenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some\ndirections in future work.",
    "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a image into different\nregions or groups based on some characteristics like color, texture, motion or\nshape etc. Active contours is a popular variational method for object\nsegmentation in images, in which the user initializes a contour which evolves\nin order to optimize an objective function designed such that the desired\nobject boundary is the optimal solution. Recently, imaging modalities that\nproduce Manifold valued images have come up, for example, DT-MRI images, vector\nfields. The traditional active contour model does not work on such images. In\nthis paper, we generalize the active contour model to work on Manifold valued\nimages. As expected, our algorithm detects regions with similar Manifold values\nin the image. Our algorithm also produces expected results on usual gray-scale\nimages, since these are nothing but trivial examples of Manifold valued images.\nAs another application of our general active contour model, we perform texture\nsegmentation on gray-scale images by first creating an appropriate Manifold\nvalued image. We demonstrate segmentation results for manifold valued images\nand texture images.",
    "Brain extraction is a fundamental step for most brain imaging studies. In\nthis paper, we investigate the problem of skull stripping and propose\ncomplementary segmentation networks (CompNets) to accurately extract the brain\nfrom T1-weighted MRI scans, for both normal and pathological brain images. The\nproposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and\nhave two pathways to learn features from both the brain tissue and its\ncomplementary part located outside of the brain. The complementary pathway\nextracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to\nbrain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training\ndataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on\nthe OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the\ntwo-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is\nverified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its\ninvariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network\ndesign is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation\nproblems with better generalization.",
    "We introduce the concept of derivate-based component-trees for images with an\narbitrary number of channels. The approach is a natural extension of the\nclassical component-tree devoted to gray-scale images. The similar structure\nenables the translation of many gray-level image processing techniques based on\nthe component-tree to hyperspectral and color images. As an example\napplication, we present an image segmentation approach that extracts Maximally\nStable Homogeneous Regions (MSHR). The approach very similar to MSER but can be\napplied to images with an arbitrary number of channels. As opposed to MSER, our\napproach implicitly segments regions with are both lighter and darker than\ntheir background for gray-scale images and can be used in OCR applications\nwhere MSER will fail. We introduce a local flooding-based immersion for the\nderivate-based component-tree construction which is linear in the number of\npixels. In the experiments, we show that the runtime scales favorably with an\nincreasing number of channels and may improve algorithms which build on MSER.",
    "  A distributed adaptive algorithm is proposed to solve a node-specific\nparameter estimation problem where nodes are interested in estimating\nparameters of local interest, parameters of common interest to a subset of\nnodes and parameters of global interest to the whole network. To address the\ndifferent node-specific parameter estimation problems, this novel algorithm\nrelies on a diffusion-based implementation of different Least Mean Squares\n(LMS) algorithms, each associated with the estimation of a specific set of\nlocal, common or global parameters. Coupled with the estimation of the\ndifferent sets of parameters, the implementation of each LMS algorithm is only\nundertaken by the nodes of the network interested in a specific set of local,\ncommon or global parameters. The study of convergence in the mean sense reveals\nthat the proposed algorithm is asymptotically unbiased. Moreover, a\nspatial-temporal energy conservation relation is provided to evaluate the\nsteady-state performance at each node in the mean-square sense. Finally, the\ntheoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed technique are\nvalidated through computer simulations in the context of cooperative spectrum\nsensing in Cognitive Radio networks.\n",
    "  The $A_\\infty$ T-system, also called the octahedron recurrence, is a\ndynamical recurrence relation. It can be realized as mutation in a\ncoefficient-free cluster algebra (Kedem 2008, Di Francesco and Kedem 2009). We\ndefine T-systems with principal coefficients from cluster algebra aspect, and\ngive combinatorial solutions with respect to any valid initial condition in\nterms of partition functions of perfect matchings, non-intersecting paths and\nnetworks. This also provides a solution to other systems with various choices\nof coefficients on T-systems including Speyer's octahedron recurrence (Speyer\n2007), generalized lambda-determinants (Di Francesco 2013) and (higher)\npentagram maps (Schwartz 1992, Ovsienko et al. 2010, Glick 2011, Gekhtman et\nal. 2014).\n",
    "  We characterize Leavitt path algebras which are Rickart, Baer, and Baer\n$*$-rings in terms of the properties of the underlying graph. In order to treat\nnon-unital Leavitt path algebras as well, we generalize these\nannihilator-related properties to locally unital rings and provide a more\ngeneral characterizations of Leavitt path algebras which are locally Rickart,\nlocally Baer, and locally Baer $*$-rings. Leavitt path algebras are also graded\nrings and we formulate the graded versions of these annihilator-related\nproperties and characterize Leavitt path algebras having those properties as\nwell.\n  Our characterizations provide a quick way to generate a wide variety of\nexamples of rings. For example, creating a Baer and not a Baer $*$-ring, a\nRickart $*$-ring which is not Baer, or a Baer and not a Rickart $*$-ring, is\nstraightforward using the graph-theoretic properties from our results. In\naddition, our characterizations showcase more properties which distinguish\nbehavior of Leavitt path algebras from their $C^*$-algebra counterparts. For\nexample, while a graph $C^*$-algebra is Baer (and a Baer $*$-ring) if and only\nif the underlying graph is finite and acyclic, a Leavitt path algebra is Baer\nif and only if the graph is finite and no cycle has an exit, and it is a Baer\n$*$-ring if and only if the graph is a finite disjoint union of graphs which\nare finite and acyclic or loops.\n",
    "We present Convolutional Oriented Boundaries (COB), which produces multiscale\noriented contours and region hierarchies starting from generic image\nclassification Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). COB is computationally\nefficient, because it requires a single CNN forward pass for multi-scale\ncontour detection and it uses a novel sparse boundary representation for\nhierarchical segmentation; it gives a significant leap in performance over the\nstate-of-the-art, and it generalizes very well to unseen categories and\ndatasets. Particularly, we show that learning to estimate not only contour\nstrength but also orientation provides more accurate results. We perform\nextensive experiments for low-level applications on BSDS, PASCAL Context,\nPASCAL Segmentation, and NYUD to evaluate boundary detection performance,\nshowing that COB provides state-of-the-art contours and region hierarchies in\nall datasets. We also evaluate COB on high-level tasks when coupled with\nmultiple pipelines for object proposals, semantic contours, semantic\nsegmentation, and object detection on MS-COCO, SBD, and PASCAL; showing that\nCOB also improves the results for all tasks.",
    "Semi-supervised learning has recently been attracting attention as an\nalternative to fully supervised models that require large pools of labeled\ndata.

    "While making a tremendous impact in various fields, deep neural networks\nusually require large amounts of labeled data for training which are expensive\nto collect in many applications, especially in the medical domain. Unlabeled\ndata, on the other hand, is much more abundant. Semi-supervised learning\ntechniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage\nunlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware\nmulti-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data,\nsuch as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is\nachieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate\ndifferent views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical\n3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In\naddition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate\nthe reliability of each view's prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one\nview requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our\nself-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each\nunlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach\ncan take advantage of unlabeled data during training. We show the effectiveness\nof our proposed semi-supervised method on several public datasets from medical\nimage segmentation tasks (NIH pancreas & LiTS liver tumor dataset). Meanwhile,\na fully-supervised method based on our approach achieved state-of-the-art\nperformances on both the LiTS liver tumor segmentation and the Medical\nSegmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, demonstrating the robustness and value\nof our framework, even when fully supervised training is feasible.",
    "We introduce a novel Deep Learning framework, which quantitatively estimates\nimage segmentation quality without the need for human inspection or labeling.\nWe refer to this method as a Quality Assurance Network -- QANet. Specifically,\ngiven an image and a `proposed' corresponding segmentation, obtained by any\nmethod including manual annotation, the QANet solves a regression problem in\norder to estimate a predefined quality measure with respect to the unknown\nground truth. The QANet is by no means yet another segmentation method.\nInstead, it performs a multi-level, multi-feature comparison of an\nimage-segmentation pair based on a unique network architecture, called the\nRibCage.\n  To demonstrate the strength of the QANet, we addressed the evaluation of\ninstance segmentation using two different datasets from different domains,\nnamely, high throughput live cell microscopy images from the Cell Segmentation\nBenchmark and natural images of plants from the Leaf Segmentation Challenge.\nWhile synthesized segmentations were used to train the QANet, it was tested on\nsegmentations obtained by publicly available methods that participated in the\ndifferent challenges. We show that the QANet accurately estimates the scores of\nthe evaluated segmentations with respect to the hidden ground truth, as\npublished by the challenges' organizers.\n  The code is available at: TBD.",
    "Person re-identification is becoming a hot research for developing both\nmachine learning algorithms and video surveillance applications. The task of\nperson re-identification is to determine which person in a gallery has the same\nidentity to a probe image. This task basically assumes that the subject of the\nprobe image belongs to the gallery, that is, the gallery contains this person.\nHowever, in practical applications such as searching a suspect in a video, this\nassumption is usually not true. In this paper, we consider the open-set person\nre-identification problem, which includes two sub-tasks, detection and\nidentification. The detection sub-task is to determine the presence of the\nprobe subject in the gallery, and the identification sub-task is to determine\nwhich person in the gallery has the same identity as the accepted probe. We\npresent a database collected from a video surveillance setting of 6 cameras,\nwith 200 persons and 7,413 images segmented. Based on this database, we develop\na benchmark protocol for evaluating the performance under the open-set person\nre-identification scenario. Several popular metric learning algorithms for\nperson re-identification have been evaluated as baselines. From the baseline\nperformance, we observe that the open-set person re-identification problem is\nstill largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed.",

    "All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday.\nMoazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US for almost three years. They were detained in the Cuban camp as part of the US-led \"war on terror\". Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after \"intensive and complex discussions\" over security. He said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003. All four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government, Mr Straw said.\nBut he added: \"Once they are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity.\" The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the return of the four detainees. But he said there were still \"serious questions\" both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said the four had been rescued from a \"legal no-man's land\". \"Their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process.\"\nAzmat Begg, father of Moazzam, thanked his lawyers and the British people for the support he had received while campaigning for his son's release. He added: \"If they have done something wrong, of course they should be punished, but if they haven't, they shouldn't have been there.\" Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. She said: \"They should at the outset have said quite clearly to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down. \"They didn't do that. They colluded with it.\" Moazzam Begg's Labour MP Roger Godsiff welcomed his release, but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges. Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said: \"People get released from prison when it's found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. \"I don't see any difference in this case.\" Human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba. Amnesty International has called Camp Delta a \"major human-rights scandal\" and an \"icon of lawlessness\". Both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as \"long overdue\". Civil rights group Liberty said it was \"delighted\" but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.\nDirector Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to \"practise what it preaches\" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars. The US has also announced that 48-year-old Australian Mamdouh Habib, previously accused of terrorist offences, will be released without charge from Camp Delta. Five British detainees released from Guantanamo in March last year were questioned by UK police before being released without charge.",
    "Technology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.\nThe firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.\nCurrently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy \"appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content\". The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.\nThe move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. \"In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past,\" said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. \"The difference is that it is very fragmented,\" he said. \"It's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race\" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsoft's \"Plays for Sure\" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.\nShelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apple's iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. \"Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods,\" she said.\nShe said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. \"It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,\" she said, \"and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.\" Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. \"People want portability,\" she said, \"and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.\" Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. \"Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,\" he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. \"The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on.\"",

    "Greek athletics' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou for missing doping tests.\nThe pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year's Athens Olympics. They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. \"A decision is now expected by around mid-March,\" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos. Kenteris, 31, who won the men's 200m title at the 2000 Sydney Games and Thanou, 30, who won the women's 100m silver medal in Sydney, face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry.

Jol added: \"We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. \"What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it.\n\"We didn't play particularly well but I am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three.\" Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. He said: \"My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. \"It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. \"It's really, really over.

It's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. \"It's not every game you score from the halfway line.\" Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. \"I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game,\" Ferguson told MUTV. \"What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays. \"But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.\n\"Thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. So you wouldn't be wasting a lot of time. \"I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football.\" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. \"When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence,\" said Wenger. \"It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.\"",

    "UK airport operator BAA has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.\nThe comments come a day ahead of a High Court challenge by residents' groups and local councils to the government's White Paper. The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. \"We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,\" a BAA spokesman said.\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. Among other measures, BAA has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near Stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.\nAt Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was \"fundamentally flawed\" and did not follow the proper consultation process. \"We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government White Paper,\" said Stop Stansted Expansion chairman Peter Sanders said. HACAN chairman John Stewart said: \"Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare. \"It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. \"Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. \" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February.",
    "Allan Scott is confident of winning a medal at next week's European Indoor Championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.\nThe 22-year-old Scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the Jose M Cagigal Memorial meeting in Madrid. \"It was definitely a learning curve and I certainly haven't ruled out challenging for a medal next week,\" said the East Kilbride athlete. The race was won by Felipe Vivancos, who equalled the Spanish record.\nSweden's Robert Kronberg was second, with Haiti's Dudley Dorival in third. Scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. He won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first IAAF Indoor Grand Prix circuit final. \"I should have done better than that,\" he said. \"I felt I could have won it.

    "AC Milan defender Jaap Stam says Manchester United \"know they made a mistake\" by selling him in 2001.\nThe sides meet at Old Trafford in the Champions League game on Wednesday and the 32-year-old's Dutchman's presence is sure to add spice to the fixture. \"United made a mistake in selling me,\" Stam told Uefa's Champions magazine. \"I was settled at Manchester United, but they wanted to sell me. If a club want to sell you, there is nothing you can do. You can be sold like cattle.\" Sir Alex Ferguson surprised the football world - and Stam - by selling the Dutchman to Lazio for £16.5m in August 2001. The decision came shortly after Stam claimed in his autobiography that Ferguson had tapped him up when he was at PSV Eindhoven. But Ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. The affair still rankles with the Dutchman.\n\"I was settled at Manchester United, I had even just ordered a new kitchen, but they wanted to sell me,\" he said. \"In what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes? \"Of course, you can refuse to go, but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. I don't agree that players control the game. \"There have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers, but I have turned them down. What's the point?\"\nWednesday's game at Old Trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between United's young attackers Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and Milan's veteran defence of Stam, Paolo Maldini, Cafu and Alessandro Costacurta. Stam says Rooney's teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game. \"We can't all be Wayne Rooneys - at his age I was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone,\" he said. \"Starting late can be a good thing. Some kids who start early get bored. \"I had my youth - having fun, drinking beers, blowing up milk cannisters. It sounds strange but it's a tradition where I grew up in Kampen - and I had done all the things I wanted to do.\"",
    "Dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, Media Labs Europe, is to shut down.\nThe research centre, which was started by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts. Since its opening in 2000, the centre has developed ideas, such as implants for teeth, and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. The centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. In a statement, Media Labs Europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the Irish Government nor the prestigious US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was willing to fund it. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies, in an attempt to regenerate the area.\nAbout three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the Labs' long-term survival. The Labs needed about 10 million euros (US$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. \"In the end, it was too deep and too long a recession,\" said Simon Jones, the Labs' managing director. Ian Pearson, BT's futurologist, told the BBC News website that the closure was a \"real shame\". BT was just one of the companies that had worked with the Labs, looking at RFID tag developments and video conferencing. \"There were a lot of very talented, creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society. \"I have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost.\"\nNoel Dempsey, the government's communications minister, said Mr Ahern had been \"very committed\" to the project. \"He is, I know, very disappointed it has come to this. At the time it seemed to be the right thing to do,\" he said. \"Unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate.\"\nDuring its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. In recent months, 14 patent applications had been filed by the Labs. Many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. Several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. The Human Connectedness group, for example, developed the iBand, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. This information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. Other projects looked at using other human senses, like touch, to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment, or on the body itself. One project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. The Labs, set up in an old Guinness brewery, housed around 100 people, made up of staff, researchers, students, collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. It is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the Labs close on 1 February. According to its latest accounts, Media Lab Europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about US$10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million euros (US$3.3 million).",

    "A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.\nThe drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits. But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.\nApproximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK. Many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.\nNow, GW Pharma's Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. \"We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,\" said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.\nThe UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex's launch in the UK. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p.",
    "The nuclear unit of Russian energy giant Gazprom is reportedly facing a 1bn rouble ($35.7m; £19.1m) back-tax claim for the 2001-2003 period.\nVedomosti newspaper reported that Russian authorities made the demand at the end of last year. The paper added that most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company's export activity. Gazprom, the biggest gas company in the world, took over nuclear fuel giant Atomstroieksport in October 2004. The main project of Atomstroieksport is the building of a nuclear plant in Iran, which has been a source of tension between Russia and the US.\nGazprom is one of the key players in the complex Russian energy market, where the government of Vladimir Putin has made moves to regain state influence over the sector. Gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm Rosneft, the company that eventually acquired Yuganskneftegas, the main unit of embattled oil giant Yukos. Claims for back-taxes was a tool used against Yukos, and led to the enforced sale Yuganskneftegas. Some analysts fear the Kremlin will continue to use these sort of moves to boost the efforts of the state to regain control over strategically important sectors such as oil.",
    "Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen.\nAlan Archibald prodded United ahead in 19 minutes and James Grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later. Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. Tony Bullock in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley. Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless.\nUnited restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. Jason Scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing Crawford and he coolly beat Ryan Esson from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. Grady received a pass from Crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of Esson. The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from Esson to keep out Robson's drive after 62 minutes. The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area.

    "The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.\nPrivate sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\nThe ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\n\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\nA slowdown in the housing market and this year's surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"",
    "UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered £960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.\nIn a speech, he called for action to reach the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. Mr Brown has just returned from a tour of African nations. The £1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health.\nThe chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK's Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday. Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra £0.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation. That could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. As well as pledging £960m over 15 years to the immunisation IFF, Britain urged other donors to contribute.\nIf Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued. Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. War on Want's John Hilary said: \"Compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. \"As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.\"",
    "Belgian brewing giant Inbev has seen its profits soar thanks to its acquisition of Brazil's biggest beer firm Ambev last year.\nInbev, which makes Stella Artois, said pre-tax profits for 2004 rose 56% to 1.16bn euros ($1.5bn; £800m), and said it expected solid growth in 2005. The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",

They also have a good record at the Stade de France, having won their first two games there, in 1999 and 2001. Wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed Italy 38-8 in Rome.\nKevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing.

    "You can now buy \"trusted computers\", but can we really trust the PC vendors, asks technology analyst Bill Thompson.\nIf you have recently bought an IBM ThinkVantage computer, a Dell Optiplex, or one of a whole range of laptops from Toshiba, HP/Compaq or Samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (TPM) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to children's toys. But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. And as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. A big advantage of the TPM is that it is hardware-based.\nAt the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. It might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor.\nHardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. This is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers. As a result we settle for second best. So when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward. After all, if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. And if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. Instead you have to use special software, like HP's ProtectTools or Wave Systems' Embassy. This provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks. Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows, \"Longhorn\". This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the \"Next Generation Secure Computing Base\", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. However there is a downside to the increased security from viruses, spyware and data theft that this will provide.\nBecause the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (DRM) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them. We have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. Users of Apple's iTunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other iTunes users, a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection.\nBut the latest version of iTunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a CD. Another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from Real's Harmony service on your iPod. Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. Similarly, users of TiVo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows, and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it. One wonders whether hardware-based DRM will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. It will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. Once it is unlocked then someone, somewhere, will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. And once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. The efforts going into DRM would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. The record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us, most of the time, will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. They will benefit more by building a market in which I can share songs with my friends, record shows I want to watch later, and burn CDs for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.",
    "Britain has offered to send a company of 120 Gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia, Downing Street said.\nThe deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province. Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.\nHowever a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in Indonesia which the Gurkhas might be able to help with. The spokesman said: \"Following this morning's daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort, the government has formally offered the Indonesian government the assistance of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters. \"This is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean.\"\nIndonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami, with 94,000 of the 140,000 confirmed deaths so far. International Development Minister Gareth Thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of Aceh. \"We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment,\" he said. \"We've also had RAF aircraft flying in equipment which the UN desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in Aceh province as well.\" The offer comes as the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw arrives in Indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast.

    "Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\"",
    "Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was \"out of control\" during the \"wild\" 1960s.\nLucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as \"Precious\" at school. Despite being told he was a \"nutter who died at sea\" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound found out about it last year. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.\nMr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: \"I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead.\" He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a \"set-up\" but he then realised all the dates fitted. \"It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,\" said the Ealing North MP. \"I don't blame Lucy's mother. I was pretty much out of control. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.\"\nMr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since. Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: \"The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. \"We were finishing each other sentences.\" Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.",
    "Japan's box office received a 3.8% boost last year, with ticket sales worth 211bn yen (£1.08bn).\nThe surge was led by animated movie Howl's Moving Castle, which took 20bn yen (£102m) to become the biggest film in Japan in 2004. It is expected to match the 30.7bn yen (£157m) record of Hayao Miyazaki's previous film Spirited Away. Japan Motion Picture Producers figures showed that 170 million cinema admissions were made in Japan in 2004. The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, was the biggest foreign movie hit in Japan last year, taking 13.8bn yen (£70.7m).\nIt was followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Finding Nemo and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The second highest-grossing Japanese film was romantic drama Crying Out Love in the Centre of the World, followed by Be With You and Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation. Japanese films accounted for 37.5% of Japan's box office total last year, with foreign films taking the remaining 62.5%. This represented a 4.5% gain for the proportion of Japanese films in 2004 compared to 2003. The number of Japanese films released rose to 310 in 2004 from 287 the previous year. Sales of movies on DVD and video amounted to 497bn yen (£2.54bn) for the year.",
    "Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be \"the most accessible browser on the market\", according to its authors.\nThe latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"\nAnother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.\nThe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "Stan Lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit Spider-Man movies.\nMany marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stan Lieberman, got a job in Timely Publications, a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, now legally adopted.\nBy the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\nLee's answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee's life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York's skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\n\"Just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee's influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.\nIn 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. His latest project is a superhero based on a real person - Jay J Armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. But his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, The Hulk and Daredevil have all been turned into Hollywood action movies in the last five years. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. It seems Stan Lee is as indestructible as his heroes.",
    "One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.\nYoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan's most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\nMr Tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn't let me use the silk futon, saying it's a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan's troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank's bad loans.",

    "Ulster clung on for a morale-boosting Celtic League win over bottom club Borders at Netherdale on Friday night.\nA late try by Borders substitute Jonny Weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the Scottish side could not complete the fightback. Ulster had led 20-6 with tries from Paul Steinmetz and Bryn Cunningham. But the Irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. Calum MacRae surrendered possession before centre Steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. Substitute Joe Pattison - who had come on for the injured Gareth Morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.\nThe speedy Steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving Adam Larkin an easy conversion. Ally Warnock clawed back three points for Borders, but they were soon hit by another double-blow. First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward. Larkin again added the extras. Even worse was to come for Borders when Larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to Kelly Brown being sin-binned. The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end. And he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory. \"Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time,\" said McCall. \"In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.\"\nMorton, Moffat, MacRae, Hore, Berthinussen, Warnock, Moore, Thomson, Ford, Douglas, Blair, Stewart, Gray, Brown, McEntee.\nKay, Parr, McGee, Rennick, Weston, Millar, Pattison.\nCunningham, Maxwell, Bell, Steinmetz, Howe, Larkin, Campbell, S.

Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March. \"I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen,\" Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday. \"I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago.

    "Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\nTreasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare.\n- Increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60,000 \n - A freeze on petrol duty \n - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \n - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than £60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to £150,000 in February.\nThe Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn.\"\nBut Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\nFor the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a £2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.",
    "Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was \"one of the proudest nights of my career.\"\nThe Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: \"It was a really great night. \"The players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans. \"We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances. For Liverpool, this result is very, very important.\" Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. The Reds scored three second-half goals in a sensational comeback capped by Gerrard's 20-yard drive. He added: \"Steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game.\n\"I have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us. \"I felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters, I cannot thank them enough. \"I want to say thank-you to the supporters, they were magnificent to help us achieve this result.\" Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time. He said: \"I'd be lying if I thought we were going through when we were losing at half-time.\n\"We had a mountain to climb, but we have climbed it and credit to everyone. \"That was one of the best goals I have scored, I caught it sweet, I haven't caught one like that for ages.

    "Music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.\nThe debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser's dream come true and a branding nightmare. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing 'oxygen' for companies that support illegal downloading. \"You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,\" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.\nHe urged people to follow his lead and 'dump' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. 'Networks like eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses,\" it said. But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\nThe reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. \"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,\" he said. \"If you put the legality issues aside, not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience,\" he added. Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical. \"We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. It is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks,\" read a statement from the discount phone firm. It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.\nHowever Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said. \"I would be surprised if these brands didn't have the know-how to prevent this happening,\" he said. At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. \"Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity, including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - Senator John Kerry and President George W. Bush,\" said chief executive Sam Yagan. There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network, he thinks. \"Peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they're most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media,\" he said.",

But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.\n\"You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible,\" says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. \"It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.\" Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.\nMainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing \"export quality\" rap.\nThe web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its \"infant stage\". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. \"He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,\" Millan says. \"He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world.\" Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. \"Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,\" Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.\nBut one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. \"It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now,\" Millan says. \"And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing.\" Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.",
    "More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests.\nTheir biggest worries are not terror threats, but over-regulation, low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.\nGlobal business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandals in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. Across Europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called IFRS. Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.\nAlready, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a \"significant threat\" or \"one of the biggest threats\". But PwC's global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.\nAccording to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: \"One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won't kill your business anymore.\" Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. Mr DiPiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had \"adjusted\" to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.\n - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.",
    "Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said.\nHowl's Moving Castle set a Japanese box office record last week, taking 1.5bn yen (£7.7m) in its first two days. Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. Howl's Moving Castle is based on a children's fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones. It tells the story of an 18-year-old woman who ages dramatically after falling under a witch's spell. She heads to a moving castle kept by Howl, a wizard, and searches for a way to become normal again. A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film \"has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike\". \"We have a good feeling about this film. We saw very good viewer response,\" he added. The film's worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January.",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\nSlower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\nAnd recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\nBusiness groups welcomed the MPC's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"",
    "Aston Villa's Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.\nThe striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. \"Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge,\" said Villa boss David O'Leary. \"I won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea.\" Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because O'Leary had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villa's manager's problems in that department.",
    "The US has pushed Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, under the US Department of Energy. IBM test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The previous top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocked up 35.86. The Top 500 list was announced on Monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world.\nIt is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second.\nOnce completed in 2005, Blue Gene/L will be more powerful than its current prototype. \"Next year with the final Blue Gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat,\" said Erich Strohmaier, one of the co-founders of the Top500 list. It will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers.\nIn second place was Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at the US space agency's (Nasa) Ames Research Center in California. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second (teraflops) in October. It will be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The defeated Japanese contender, the Earth Simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity.\nSince the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.\nThe draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. \"There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,\" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.\nIn December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.",
    "Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet \"rogue-dialling\" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.\nIt has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge. Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. They must warn people earlier about possible fraud, Icstis said.\nPeople who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. Victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: \"Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. \"If my bill goes over the usual £50 a month I want to know about it straight away - I don't want to be told when it's hit £750.\"\nPhone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said. \"We alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers,\" he added.\nTelecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said: \"Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary. \"So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach.\" The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.\nGavin Patterson, group managing director for BT Consumer, said \"We do look at customer's calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. \"We're looking at the moment at whether we can improve this.\" But as BT handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was \"quite a task in itself\", he added. The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. At the moment, it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down.\nI use free anti-virus software (AVG) and free firewall protection (ZoneAlarm). Both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter's love of music sites. How about ISPs informing all customers of such facilities? The responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues.\nIgnorance is and always has been an expensive business.\nDoes any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised? The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ?\nThese diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal MP3s, porn and pirated software. If people didn't visit such sites they'd be considerably less at risk. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? It seems everyone has to be a 'victim' these days!\nPart of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. A secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user's knowledge.\nThese scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. They should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. Or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going?\nWhy don't BT et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request? To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. After you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions, they cannot insist on you paying the bill. To do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. No customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills.\nDisable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. Or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. You would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your PC? Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault!\nI was very impressed with our phone company recently. I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number. Great service. And I got the tickets as well!\nI have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. Three months later another huge bill of over £1,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place. Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.\nI have been scammed of £139. The operator will do nothing about this and, to add insult to injury, I was charged VAT by the government.\nPremium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.\nI know people who have run up large bills, despite being IT-literate. From talking to BT in Belfast, I believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. It's not the fault of phone companies, and at last they are doing something about it.\nIt's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! Not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly.\nI haven't \"fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam\" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. In most cases the user is entirely at fault, which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them.\nMy telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal £3 to £5, to £320. This was because of the scam. They simply billed me. What particularly galls me, over and above having over £300 stolen, is that the supplier and the government (through VAT) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses.\nHow about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted? That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. At least any disputed amount would be limited, far easier for a telecoms operator to write off £20 than it is £750.\nA few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection.\nHow about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date? That should prevent the vast majority of these scams.",
    "Shares in Cairn Energy, a UK oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.\nThe company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable. Cairn's shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year. Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he was \"disappointed\" with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan. Investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a \"significant downgrade of the initial expectation\".\nCairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. The company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; £10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. A spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field's current value.\n\"Cairn refutes the government's position,\" Mr Gammell said. He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - India's state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - and not the contractor. \"We have a pretty strong legal case here,\" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statements though. The shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. \"I think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,\" said analyst Jason Kenney at ING.\nThe disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for Cairn's existing oilfields. The company raised targets for its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in India from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. \"These two fields will provide the core of the future developments in Rajasthan,\" Mr Gammell said. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to South Asia from interests in the US and Europe. Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.",

Sony has billed the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan.

    "Shares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had deepened to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m.\nThe UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and \"operating flaws\" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.",
    "Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan has praised striker Robbie Fowler for his landmark return to form.\nThe 29-year-old, out of favour at City earlier this season, took his Premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in Monday's 3-2 win at Norwich. \"He is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did,\" Keegan said. \"He has worked hard to get back to where he is now.\" The former Liverpool striker, who moved to City in 2003 after a poor stint at Leeds, has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season.\nFowler overtook Les Ferdinand on Tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the Premiership, with 151 goals, and he only trails Alan Shearer (250) and Andy Cole (173). And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward. \"He can get better if we can supply him better,\" added Keegan. \"People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face.\" Fowler's double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards. \"I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington,\" he said. \"His team have got great character, they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm. \"I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership. \"The stadium and the atmosphere is great, it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know.\"",
    "Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, D dal Maso, P Griffen, M Barbini, KP Robertson.\nG Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.\nR McBryde, J Yapp, I Gough, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, K Morgan.\nAndrew Cole (Australia).",
    "Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner.\nGlobally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly \"must-have\" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.\nCamera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.\nMobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.\nImages from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.\nThe exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said.",
    "David Beckham expressed his relief at Real Madrid's passage to the Champions League knockout phase.\nAfter Real's 3-0 win at Roma, the England skipper admitted another season of under-achievement would not be tolerated at the Bernabeu stadium. Beckham said: \"It's expected of Madrid to get through, but it's a relief for the club and players to have won. \"We lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything.\" Real's finish as runners-up in their Champions League group means they cannot face his old club Manchester United in the next round. But Real could be drawn against other Premiership hopefuls, Arsenal or Chelsea, who won their respective groups. \"It's going to be great whoever we play, even if we don't get either of the two English teams.\"",
    "Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.\nThe Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets. The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current £7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.\nFor many deaf people, especially those born deaf, BSL is a first and preferred means of communication.\nUntil now, the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator. \"In the past, I've used textphones but they have problems,\" said Robert Currington who is taking part in the pilot. \"I communicate in BSL; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message.\" \"I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply.\" The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call. \"There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people,\" said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels. \"In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. \"By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group.\"\nOfcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. And new technology, including the Video Relay Service, will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. But a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation. \"Any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider,\" he said. Mr Currington, like many of the UK's 70,000 BSL users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available. \"The relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure,\" he said. \"I can show my emotions more easily in BSL in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls.\"",
    "Pop singer Delta Goodrem has scooped one of the top individual prizes at the first Australian MTV Music Awards.\nThe 21-year-old singer won the award for best female artist, with Australian Idol runner-up Shannon Noll taking the title of best male at the ceremony. Goodrem, known in both Britain and Australia for her role as Nina Tucker in TV soap Neighbours, also performed a duet with boyfriend Brian McFadden. Other winners included Green Day, voted best group, and the Black Eyed Peas. Goodrem, Green Day and the Black Eyed Peas took home two awards each. As well as best female, Goodrem also took home the Pepsi Viewers Choice Award, whilst Green Day bagged the prize for best rock video for American Idiot. The Black Eyed Peas won awards for best R 'n' B video and sexiest video, both for Hey Mama. Local singer and songwriter Missy Higgins took the title of breakthrough artist of the year, with Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian taking the honours for best pop video. The VH1 First Music Award went to Cher honouring her achievements within the music industry. The ceremony was held at the Luna Park fairground in Sydney Harbour and was hosted by the Osbourne family. Artists including Carmen Electra, Missy Higgins, Kelly Osbourne, Green Day, Ja Rule and Natalie Imbruglia gave live performances at the event.",
    "Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.\nInvestors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia's listed firms. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,\" said ABN Amro's Eddie Wong. \"[But] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.\"\nIndia's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\nThailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\nIn the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.\nHowever, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. \"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. \"The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.\nHe told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell said the country's health rates were \"lamentable\" not least because of smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\n - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \n - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \n - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500 \n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \n - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. \n \nMr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.\" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: \"Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.",

    "Carlos Moya described Spain's Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA's challenge in Seville.\nMoya made up for missing Spain's 2000 victory through injury by beating Roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"I have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day,\" said Moya. \"All my energy has been focused on today. \"What I have lived today I do not think I will live again.\" Spain's only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia. And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: \"The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset. \"Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way. It helps me reach my goals if I am obsessed. \"It's really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.\" Spanish captain Jordi Arrese said: \"Charly played a great game. It was his opportunity and he hasn't let us down. \"He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him. \"He had been waiting years to be in this position.\" Spain's victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.\nAged 18 years and 185 days, the Mallorcan became the youngest player to win the Davis Cup. \"What a great way to finish the year,\" said Nadal afterwards. US coach Patrick McEnroe wants Roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. \"I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.\" \"Obviously it's unrealistic to say that we're going to just start playing constantly on clay, with the schedule. \"But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff,\" said McEnroe. Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville's Olympic Stadium. \"It's just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world,\" said the American. \"I had my chances and just didn't convert them. The bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. \"They came out, took care of business and they beat us. It's as simple as that.\"",
    "A senior Tory MP has criticised agriculture department Defra's \"lackadaisical\" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.\nPublic accounts committee chairman Edward Leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The National Audit Office said Defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. But Mr Leigh said the department was \"dragging its heels\".\nThat comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. He also said Defra had been \"dreadfully slow\" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.\nThe outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the UK up to £8bn. \"Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and £40m of invoices remain unpaid,\" Mr Leigh said. Mr Leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an IT system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.\nMinisters had hoped to get £900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. That was because the UK had valued the culled animals at between \"two and three times\" the commission's assessment of their likely market value. National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. On the issue of the unpaid invoices, Sir John said Defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001, \"but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations\".\nMr Leigh said being \"better prepared\" would also help avoid the need for \"mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak\". A Defra spokesman said: \"We welcome the report. It acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak. \"However, the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.\"",
    "Microsoft has entered the desktop search fray, releasing a test version of its tool to find documents, e-mails and other files on a PC hard drive.\nThe beta program only works on PCs running Windows XP or Windows 2000. The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded with firms touting programs that help people find files. Search giant Google launched its desktop search tool in October, while Yahoo is planning to release similar software in January.\n\"Our ambition for search is to provide the ultimate information tool that can find anything you're looking for,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president at Microsoft's MSN internet division. Microsoft's program can be used as a toolbar on the Windows desktop, the Internet Explorer browser and within the Outlook e-mail program. The software giant is coming late to the desktop search arena, competing with a large number of rivals. Google has already released a desktop tool. Yahoo is planning to get into the game in January and AOL is expected to offer desktop searching early next year. Small firms such as Blinkx, Copernic, Enfish X1 Technologies and X-Friend offer tools that catalogue the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer. Apple will release a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to be released with the Tiger operating system.",
    "US hip-hop duo OutKast have capped a year of award glory with three prizes at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.\nThey won best group, best video and best song for hit Hey Ya! after getting five nominations. R&B singer Usher won best male and best album for Confessions, while UK rock band Muse were named best alternative act and best British artists. OutKast will add their awards to the four they won at the US MTV Awards in August and three Grammys in February. Not only was Hey Ya! one of the biggest global hits of last year, but OutKast have been widely acclaimed as one of the most exciting and innovative acts in music. Their double CD album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which saw Andre 3000 and Big Boi each produce one disc, was hailed as the album of 2003 by many critics.\nAndre 3000 thanked fans \"for supporting OutKast throughout the years\". \"We really appreciate it,\" he said. \"I hope you don't get tired of us, but we only do what we do.\" Also competing for best group had been the Beastie Boys, the Black Eyed Peas, D12 and Maroon 5. And Anastacia, Britney Spears, Maroon 5 and Ludacris had been on the shortlist for best song.\nOutKast did lose out in the contest for best album - which was won by Usher, another award favourite. Usher, who performed a duet with Alicia Keys, also beat off competition from Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly and Robbie Williams to take the best male crown. He had four nominations going into the ceremony, with seven artists nominated in three categories.\nEminem's group, D12, were surprise winners in the best hip-hop category, beating the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nelly. Eminem told the crowd: \"D12 finally won an award, thank you very much.\" The rapper opened the show with a performance of his songs Like Toy Soldiers and Just Lose It, for which he was joined on stage by a crowd of children. The Black Eyed Peas - who had a global hit with Where is the Love? - picked up the prize for best pop act, beating Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams and Britney Spears. Spears was named best female, sending a message of thanks on video saying the award \"means so much to me\". Alicia Keys, Anastasia, Avril Lavigne and Beyonce Knowles had featured alongside her in that contest.\nLinkin Park singer Chester Bennington described their prize for best rock band as \"quite an honour\" while Muse said their win for best alternative act was \"a real surprise for us\". Muse were also named best UK and Ireland act, ahead of Franz Ferdinand, Natasha Bedingfield, Jamelia and The Streets. Referring to the fact that winners of 11 of the 12 main awards were from the US, Muse singer Matt Bellamy said: \"There needs to be more European bands.\" The 11th annual awards were hosted by hip-hop artist Xzibit and watched by 6,000 people at the Tor Di Valle arena, plus millions more on TV around the world. The ceremony featured performances from the Beastie Boys, who entered the stage on bicycles and skateboards, No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani being lowered from a giant clock and Nelly doing a duet with Pharrell Williams. MTV also organised a huge open-air concert featuring Anastacia and The Cure outside the Italian capital's ancient Colosseum, with some estimates putting the attendance there at 200,000. Last year's big winner at the MTV Europe Awards, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, was Justin Timberlake, who walked away with three trophies.",

But Dallaglio, who called time on England earlier this year, said: \"I assure you I wouldn't let anyone down. \"I know what it takes and what I have to offer,\" he told the Daily Telegraph. Dallaglio toured South Africa with the Lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to Australia three years ago.\nThe 32-year-old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf-life.

    "The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.\nAgriculture Minister Adamu Bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; £591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.\nCocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. \"People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,\" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. \"The farmers in the village never see any assistance,\" he added.\nAt the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.",
    "Germaine Greer has criticised Celebrity Big Brother's \"bullying\" of housemates after quitting the reality TV show.\nShe said \"superior\" bullying tactics, like making housemates cold and hungry, could encourage playground bullying. She also condemned the \"complete irresponsibility\" of adding Brigitte Nielsen's former mother-in-law Jackie Stallone to the house on Monday. Nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children, Greer said. The feminist writer and broadcaster said Big Brother had behaved \"like a child rather than a parent\" by taunting contestant John McCririck after denying him a cola drink. \"I thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground,\" Greer said. She also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking \"agendas\".\n\"I had no idea who would be in here and it's wrong for me to present myself in the same context as they are.\" Media observers had been surprised by Greer's initial decision to join the third celebrity version of the Channel 4 reality TV show, given that she has written critical articles about the format in the past. As she packed her suitcase to leave the house she told fellow housemates: \"I'm leaving over specific issues, but best for everyone if I don't discuss them. \"I have a problem with decisions, I make them fast and when I make them, I stick to them.\" Greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against Big Brother.\nOther celebrities to walk out of a reality show TV include Sex Pistol John Lydon, former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook and ex-E17 singer Brian Harvey who all left I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Previous Big Brother housemates to leave before their time were Sunita Sharma and Sandy Cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.\nVOTE   Was Germaine Greer right to leave Celebrity Big Brother?   Yes  No   Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion\nHappy Mondays dancer Bez is now 2-1 favourite to win the show, followed by Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie at 5-2 and actor Jeremy Edwards at 4-1. Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush said that the series was still \"wide open\", adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on McCririck slashing his odds to 8-1. DJ Lisa I'Anson is the outsider with odds of 40-1, while Jackie Stallone, who joined the house on Monday, is also one of the less popular housemates at 20-1. The first eviction of the series has now been postponed after Greer's exit unexpectedly reduced the number of competitors. The eight remaining contestants are competing for a £50,000 prize, to be donated to the charity of their choice, if they survive a series of public votes. For every 50p vote cast by viewers by telephone or text during the programme's run, 9p will go to a tsunami charity appeal.",
    "Tony Blair has pledged to \"never, ever, ever\" attack Tory leader Michael Howard over his Jewish beliefs.\nThe prime minister told the Jewish Chronicle: \"If you look at what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically.\" Mr Blair also distanced himself from recent Labour campaign posters featuring Mr Howard, which critics claimed were \"anti-Semitic\". These were \"not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the Jewish community,\" Mr Blair insisted.\nOne poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs. Another pictured the Tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said echoed the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.\nOthers compared the image to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. Labour has since taken the designs of its website, saying members had preferred other designs. During his interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Mr Blair said: \"I've been a very strong supporter of the Jewish community and Israel, and will always be so.\" Pressed on whether he would draw attention to Mr Howard's Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, he replied: \"The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. It's untrue. \"If you look what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically. I would never, ever, ever attack him on that basis.\"\nMr Blair also defended his party's attitude towards the Jewish community, pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the Holocaust Memorial Day. He added that Labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism.\nNeither the Conservatives nor the Liberal Democrats wished to comment on Mr Blair's words. The prime minister was speaking as London's Labour mayor Ken Livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a Jewish reporter from the city's Evening Standard newspaper. Mr Blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter, Oliver Finegold, to a concentration camp guard. Mr Livingstone \"should have withdrawn the comment immediately\" once he realised the journalist was Jewish, said Mr Blair. \"I'm sure that is what in truth he wants to do. Well, he should do it.\" Mr Livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made, and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper. He conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.",
    "Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venice's famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.\nViotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milan's La Scala and the Vienna State Opera. His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet's Manon last week.\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti's last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Vienna State Opera.",
    "Legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the man credited with developing \"total football\", has died aged 77.\nReferred to in the Netherlands as \"the General\", Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Cup - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Germany. However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final. Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971. His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world. The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football. Michels had recently undergone heart surgery and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: \"He was one of the best coaches we had in history.\" The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, named coach of the century by world football's governing body Fifa in 1999, also won five caps for the Netherlands as a bruising centre forward. Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp said: \"He was the man who, together with Cruyff, made Dutch football big.\"",
    "The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.\nStaff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered. US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.\nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand \"what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath\".\nAdding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate \"sickout\". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.\nUS Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.\n\"US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,\" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was \"embarrassed by the situation\" and \"deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,\" The probe will focus on the industry's compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair \"deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline's crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,\" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.",
    "Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else's agenda.\" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can't change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves.\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn't going to be there in New York, that's been taken out of the equation.\" \nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.\"",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.\nRates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August. Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.\nRising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.\n\"Today's no change decision is correct,\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"\nMr Frost added: \"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"\nOn Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\n\"So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.",
    "Germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.\nGross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. It is the nineteenth month in a row that the ECB has not moved borrowing costs. Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.\n\"During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,\" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt. \"If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.\" Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. They have also warned there are more cost cutting measures on the horizon.",
    "Tony Blair has launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a \"ludicrous improbability\".\nThe prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure. Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut £35bn in \"wasteful\" spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts. On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing \"inefficiencies\" which had \"burgeoned\" under Labour. In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.\n\"I believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government.\" Mr Blair added: \"They, the Conservatives have learned nothing.\" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed.\nMr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. \"So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight.\" In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education. \"Everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,\" he said. Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for \"huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy\". \"The public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a Tory government,\" he concluded.\nGordon Brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny. Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be \"distracted or diverted\". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: \"We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.\"\nMr Brown warned that the Tories were planning \"the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto\". Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of \"misrepresenting\" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans. \"He still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools, hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,\" Mr Letwin said. \"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans?\"",
    "British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.\nThe Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. Another 7% said they would not vote at all. The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006. The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.\nBallot papers in the poll will ask: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?\" The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.\nThe treaty was signed by all 25 current EU members in Rome last October and is due to come into force in November 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote. Meanwhile, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\".",
    "Ray Charles, who has won a string of posthumous Grammy Awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.\nHis sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent UK beat and R&B scenes.\nCompared in stature to Elvis Presley by some commentators, Charles' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison. His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the \"devil's\" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.\nWithout Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett. He was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock 'n' roll greats, including I've Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What'd I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael's sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack.\nHe also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of Hank Williams standards such as Your Cheating Heart and You Win Again. More than 40 years after its release, his 1962 ABC album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is still regarded as a classic. His version of Don Gibson's I Can't Stop Loving You topped the pop and R&B charts in the US. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People.\nOn it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a \"brother in every sense of the word\". \"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did,\" he said. Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes. \"I'm quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,\" he told BBC News Online. \"I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever.\"",

Warriors' goalkeeper Murambadoro, who made a name for himself at the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia, helped Bnei Sakhnin overcome Albania's Partizani Tirana 6-1 in the previous round. Murambadoro moved to Israel recently after a brief stint with South African club Hellenic. The club won the Israeli Cup final last season and are based in Sakhnin, which is near Haifa.

    "The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.\nShe told the Guardian newspaper there would be no \"Las Vegas-style\" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes \"a pile of pants\". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. \"You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots,\" Mr Pound told the Today programme. \"I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,\" he said.\nMs Jowell complained of the \"scale of misrepresentation\" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to \"protect children and the vulnerable\" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: \"We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing.\" And continued: \"We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way.\" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.",
    "The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor.\nNew owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers. It also plans to develop a \"worldwide entertainment concept\" with the brand, although details are not yet known. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.\nIn the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.\nThe Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.\nTulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run. The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m.",
    "The 2005 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is a geek's paradise with more than 50,000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event.\nTop gadgets at the show are highlighted in the Innovations Showcase, which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. The BBC News website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005. \n \nOne of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files. The 2.5GB and 5GB circular pocket hard drive from Seagate might help. The external USB drive won a CES best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket. \"It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool,\" said Seagate. \"It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality.\" \"It is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy,\" it said. In the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures. \n \nUniversal Electronics' NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house. It can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. Working with home broadband networks and PCs, the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful, simple interface. Paul Arling, UEI chief, said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. He said the Nevo gave people a simple, single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. The Nevo won two awards at CES, one as a Girl's Best Friend award and another for innovation, design and engineering. The gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (£425). \n \nHotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its Solo Chassis gaming chair. The specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own \"space\". It is compatible with all the major games consoles, DVD players and PCs. \"We found that kids love playing in surround sound,\" said Jay LeBoff from Hotseat. \"We are looking at offering different types of seats, depending on the market success of this one.\" The chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos, with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. And a drinks holder. The chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in April and is expected to cost $399 (£211). \n \nSatellite radio is big business in the US. In the UK, the digital radio technology is known as DAB and works on slightly different technology. Eton Corporation's Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US. DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. \"It is for the risqu&#233; consumer,\" said an Eton spokesperson. \"We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.\" The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. In the US is it expected to cost $250 (£133). \n \nThe average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES. This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years' time. One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo's tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months. A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. \n \nWearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. MPIO's tiny digital USB music players come in an array of fashionable colours, taking a leaf out of the Apple iPod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. Slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. Although the pendant design was launched three months ago, the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends. An even dinkier model, the FY500, comes out in May and will store about 256MB of music. The range of players recently won an International Forum design award 2005.",
    "The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\nJob creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.",
    "The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).\nThe Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal. Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.\nThe Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk.\nBut critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. According to Menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. \"We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,\" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. \"The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today.\"\nMenatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to \"virtually nothing\" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%. According to its Paris lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case. But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. \"Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,\" he said.\nYukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep. He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.",
    "Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nThe fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox.\nThe thrust of this year's show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. \"The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,\" Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website. \"It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.\"\nConsumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. \"This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. \"Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,\" said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the \"democratisation\" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple's iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.\nThe CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft's Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January.",
    "Web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.\nThese online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. The most well-known examples include Iraqi Salam Pax's accounts of the US-led war, former Iranian vice-president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign. There are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last November.\nThe blogging movement has been building up for many years.\nAndrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. \"You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before,\" he says. \"And blogs were a key part of that transformation.\" Among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying \"we are sorry\" for George W Bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio. \"We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas,\" he told the BBC News website. \"But they followed the story, they didn't lead it.\"\nSome parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.\nOthers, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content. \"I don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. It is in transition, as society itself is in transition,\" says Mr Nachison. However, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. \"The one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, it is threatened. And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse,\" says Mr Nachison. \"The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't, that's gone forever.\" \"With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.\"\nIt seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.\nBut the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. Tools such as Google's Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog. US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. But experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay. \"We are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other,\" said Mr Nachison. \"And there's going to be bad that comes with the good.\"",
    "China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.\nThe move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. \"Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,\" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website.\nSome of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.\nThe Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.",
    "European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro.\nThe European single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months. Tacit approval from the White House for the weaker greenback, which could help counteract huge deficits, has helped trigger the move. But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden.\nChina is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar. \"Asia should engage in greater currency flexibility,\" said French finance minister Herve Gaymard, after a meeting with his German counterpart Hans Eichel. Markets responded by pushing the euro lower, in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the G7 industrialised countries next week. Early on Tuesday morning, the dollar had edged higher to 1.3040 euros. The yen, meanwhile, had strengthened to 102.975 against the dollar by 0730 GMT.",
    "Most areas of the US saw their economy continue to expand in December and early January, the US Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book report.\nOf the 12 US regions it identifies for the study, 11 showed stronger economic growth, with only the Cleveland area falling behind with a \"mixed\" rating. Consumer spending was higher in December than November, and festive sales were also up on 2003. The employment picture also improved, the Fed said.\n\"Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest,\" the Beige Book said. \"Several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.\" The report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. \"Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington DC, and New York City, two of the nation's strongest commercial markets,\" the Fed said.",
    "Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.\nMr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair. A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.\nThe event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, Mr Brown replied: \"You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy.\"\nHe refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. Mr Brown later told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\" Downing Street cited that comment when reporters' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe\". Labour's new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign \"which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country\".\nConservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: \"The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H.\" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.\nThe prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a \"scorching\" from MPs.\nOn Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: \"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.\" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked.",
    "Spectators were evacuated from Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and Real Sociedad.\nMore than 70,000 people abandoned the ground with the score at 1-1 and only three minutes left to play. The Basque newspaper Gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. But after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs, the police said that no explosive device had been found.\n\"The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything,\" said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. \"The best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us.\" Madrid midfielder Guti told private Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: \"I have never seen this before and sport should be above it all.\" Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. It is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand.\nIf the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. Initial reports suggested the Basque separatist group ETA may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. The Bernabeu was targeted by ETA on 1 May, 2002, when Madrid were about to play FC Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. A car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club.\nAnelka was quoted in a French newspaper as saying he would like to play in the Champions League for a bigger club. But chairman John Wardle said: \"I've spoken to Nicolas and he's apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the French press. \"We are a big club. Nicolas told me that he agrees with me that we are a big club.\" Wardle was speaking at the club's annual general meeting, where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker. The club still owe French club PSG £5m from the purchase of Anelka in May 2002. He has been linked with a move to Barcelona and Liverpool, and Reds skipper Steven Gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at Anfield. But Wardle added: \"There's been no bids for Nicolas Anelka. No-one has come to me and said I would like to buy Nicolas Anelka.\n\"If a bid comes in for Nicolas Anelka I will speak to the board and then speak to Kevin Keegan. \"If there was a bid and it was a bid of substance and worth taking then between us we'd decide. \"We still owe some money on Nicolas which we have clear out, so it would have to be above that.\" Wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips. He added: \"I've no intention of selling Shaun Wright-Phillips. \"If someone comes with a silly bid I'll have to discuss it. \"But we're not putting him on the shelf to sell. He is the heart and soul of this club and has his heart and sole in this club, and he would be very upset if I put him in the shop window. \"He was an academy kid here, he's just signed a new four-year deal, I don't think he'd do that unless he wanted to play for Manchester City Football Club.\" City recently announced debts of £62m, but Wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the January transfer window. He said: \"Like Kevin I'd like to see some players come in. We've got to see what we can do - whether it's a on a Bosman or not. \"We will try to be creative to generate some funds. But maybe we have to start looking at clubs like Everton and Bolton to see how they have been dealing in the transfer market and do a similar type of thing.\"",
    "The Conservatives would stand up for the \"forgotten majority\", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.\nThe Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values. In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. Labour says the document offers only a return to a \"failed Tory past\". The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.\nCampaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster. Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto. Other chapters will follow in coming weeks.\nIn a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the \"forgotten majority\" made up the backbone of Britain. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. He says in the manifesto foreword: \"They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair.\"\nSaying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue \"down the path of ever rising taxes\". He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall \"bureaucrats\". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. \"The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,\" he says.\nMr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. Mr Howard told BBC News: \"I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep.\" The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. It had nothing to do with putting \"clear blue water\" between himself and his opponents.\nLabour's election slogan will be: \"Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again\". Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of \"launching Thatcherism in instalments\" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September. \"The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust,\" he said.",

Radcliffe's career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the \"Big City\" marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. \"Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,\" said Radcliffe. \"I don't pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. \"I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. \"It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.\"",

    "Film-maker Spike Lee says black representation is stronger than ever in cinema and TV but the true power in entertainment lies behind the camera.\nThe She Hate Me director urged students at his old Atlanta university, Morehouse College, to seek \"gatekeeper positions\" behind the scenes. Lee told them to \"work up the corporate ladder because everybody can't be an actor, everybody can't make a record\". He spoke as part of a discussion panel, then led a retrospective of his films.\nReturning to his old university, which educates only African American students, Lee discussed the challenges facing black people in the entertainment industry. \"Even Denzel (Washington), he's getting $20m a movie. But when it comes time to do a movie, he has to go to one of those gatekeepers,\" Lee said. He told aspiring young film-makers in the audience not to ignore non-traditional routes to getting a movie made, including raising funds independently and releasing films straight to DVD. \"It's a huge market,\" the 47-year-old director said. \"It's not something that should be looked upon as a stepchild.\" Lee has made more than 25 films, including Jungle Fever, Do the Right Thing, Summer of Sam and 1986 hit She's Gotta Have It.",
    "Your computer can now help solve the world's most difficult health and social problems.\nLaunched this week, the World Community Grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems. The donated processor cycles will help the WCG create virtual supercomputers via the net. The idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop PCs. One of the most successful collaboration projects was Seti@home, run by the Search for Extra Terrestrial Life project, which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication.\nAnyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the WGC website. Once installed, the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process, and reports back after completing that task. The first WCG problem being tackled will be the Human Proteome Folding Project, which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold.\nThe subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences, and technology. The body will evaluate proposals from leading research, public and not-for-profit organizations, and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year. Organisations also represented on the board include the United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organisation.\n\"The World Community Grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues,\" said Elain Gallin, program director for medical research at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. \"[It] will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems\", she added. IBM has donated the hardware, software, technical services and expertise to build the basic infrastructure for the grid.

    "Cult British group Portishead have revealed they are writing their third album, their first in eight years.\nFounding member Geoff Barrow told BBC 6 Music the record was well on the way to being completed. \"We're actually into it as we speak. We took some time off for Christmas, but generally we're doing another record,\" Barrow told the digital radio station. News of their album plans comes after confirmation the Bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam's Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.\n\"We've just had our heads down really, we've never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. \"So for us it just seems, even though we haven't played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven't released a record for a long time.\" Portishead will not play any new material at next month's concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Other acts appearing include Liverpool band The Coral and former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Dummy was a critics' favourite in 1994, hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.",
    "Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.\nNew figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor's 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.\nThe economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.\nMr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. \"The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,\" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. \"But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.\"\nConsumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. \"The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,\" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was \"much less alarming\" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which \"are no indication of broad PPI pressure\", were responsible for the increase, he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said \"it is a good bet these increases won't stick\".",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "I'm seriously really upset at second boss vault of stars. For a pure melee rogue it's next to impossible to help with the ice. Since we're pretty squishy as it is if you're standing on ice for more then. 5 seconds you're dead. That's insane but I can dodge and shit so whatever. But the aoe the boss does for ice just randomly hits after putting a red circle around u. Like it's really hard to dodge as I haven't found its timed at all.. Again I can get past that. What I can't get past is the god damn icicles. It's literally impossible as a melee character to help get your team broken out. The ice surrounding it hits insanely hard which is fucked. So I can't be near it. If I so happen to hit one good encounter and break them out it explodes and kills me. So which leaves me with one option tunnel vision. Which does the job  UT only once every 60 seconds. Ice happens every 20 so wtf am I to do. Help if there is a way",
    "I'm not sure if this has been discussed before, but I wanted to bring it up because it's been a while, and it doesn't seem like this issue has been fixed... Every time and I mean, every single time I paricipate, regardless if I finish 1st or 5th, the game takes me to last place. The  moment i reach the finish line it starts loading and keeps loading until everyone has run \"passed\" me and obviously loaded the finish faster than me.... Is this a thing that's meant to be happening? Recently I actually managed to fishish first for the first time and that was only because everyone else had somehow lagged so much behind me that it managed to load before they finished, which is even more purplexing because it means it's not a techical issue that happens all the time. It seems to be more like a bad design choice.... It's extremily frustrating especially since the run itself is also prety frustrating... Is this an issue worth reporting? Is it my wifi??, I mean it's not good, but that's just unfair... I heard someone else here was having the same issue... Is this how the runs go, do you have to finish like a good minute before everyone else to get first place???",
    "As the title says, I got this extreme feeling of wanting to drink women's milk from her tits. I don't know if there is a link for that, but I always want to do it. Even if she's not pregnant. I want to like keeping sucking till some comes out. Maybe, when I have a wife, I'll be sucking on her tits while she's pregnant with our own baby😂. But, right now, I want to just suck on some female's tit for some milk. Maybe, it's because I wasn't able to do it as a child since I was allergic to a lot of things as a baby, so I couldn't. But, now, I'm fine. I don't care if the woman's tits are small or big. I just want to suck them for the milk🤤😂😂. Like a milk vampire🤣. I'll probably get off just by sucking them dry🤤",
    "Not exactly sure where to post this but I thought this was a good one. I recently moved in with my good friend from high school after graduating college in May. Things are good between us, I have known him since middle school and we get along great. The rough thing is I am and have always been jealous of him. He's a tall attractive blonde guy with natural good looks and I am let's say not that. I have come to terms with not being super attractive a long time ago but it is tough to hear him talk about all the girls he rejects or gets with. He just seems happier than I am with his life, I work IT and make a sizeable salary while he works part time with no degree and takes a nap for most of the day. He just seems better than me at all of our shared hobbies. I don't want these feelings to ruin our friendship because he is a good friend but I find myself getting more annoyed at it after moving in. Any advice?",
    "I finally got around to giving my retriever a bath today after a month. He's been itchy these past few days and I figured a bath would help him. He's prone to itchy skin from time to time due to food allergies to environmental allergies. I used a medicated anti-itch shampoo. Just now my brother started grilling me about what I used to bathe him with to what I used to dry him with after, because he was scratching a lot. I agree, he is still scratching, but no more than he was these past few days. I felt slighted cuz I feel like he's indirectly blaming me for making the dog itchy. And today's my birthday and I chose to spend a quiet day at home relaxing and giving my dogs a bath and my day just got ruined by that. He couldn't keep his mouth shut and blame me tomorrow instead...I'm sorry if I sound petty. I just feel sad suddenly..I wanted a day where I could mentally escape and just let my stress go and he completely ruined it and made me feel bad..",
    "I had zero anxiety about getting this shot, I’m a perfectly healthy 26 year old male. However, I had a terrible experience getting the first vaccine. Two minutes after injection, my ears start ringing and I become lightheaded. Next, my vision starts to blacken and become distorted. This intensified for several minutes and I was sweating an insane amount. At this point I’m freaking tf out because I can’t see nor can I hear and I know I’m like the only person having this experience. I did not flag anyone down I just waited in panic hoping my senses would return. After what seemed like a lifetime, but was only 3 minutes, my vision started to return and I suddenly got freezing although I continued to sweat. I left feeling like I just had intercourse against my will, and I also did not tell anyone at the site. I now feel very reluctant to get the 2nd Pfizer dose and am overall just still shocked I had such a terrible experience. Has anyone experienced something similar? Should I have told someone?",
    "I've only dated one person and I loved her with my whole being and she said the same to me but then she cheated on me and whenever we fought she made me feel like it was my fault. We tried to make it work but she kept talking to him behind my back and then she started to distance herself from me broke up with me and immediately fucked around with him saying that she didn't love me anymore when a week before she was saying how much I meant to her. Couple months later they stopped being together and we got together again after talking for a while and she said she started to like me again but then suddenly completely stopped talking to me saying she realised she didn't miss me that much and then blocked me everywhere and seems to be with him again. I don't know what I feel, I feel used, unlovable and worthless. I get massive panic and anxiety remembering everything and I've tried to kill myself three times and two times had to be taken to the hospital. She's the only person that's actually made me feel loved. It's like I have no value or reason to be respected.",
    "I’ll try to be as brief as possible: I was diagnosed with depression around five years ago, when I was only 17, after I tried to commit suicide. As a consequence, I started seeing a therapist while also taking medications. And I actually saw some improvements. However, Everything went downhill Two years ago, when my mother passed away. She was the person I loved the most in the world, and the only one who never made me feel guilty about my problems, so because I am dumb as fuck I just disappeared, never contacted my therapists again, stopped my medications, and moved to London while also taking drugs and leading a very wild life until I almost killed myself. I have now come home for nearly one year, and I made the hard decision of starting therapy again. Last week I went to see a psychiatrist that a friend of mine suggested me to see. After he asked me a few questions whose answers I am not sure he understood since he kept interrupting me, he told me, “Listen to me, kid, you are not sick, or depressed, look at yourself, you are all pretty and dolled up, you are probably just sad because your mum died, you simply need to toughen up and get over it, and you’ll be fine” I Was shocked. I left his office crying, and now I am totally at a loss. Should I give up on therapy? Should I see thiS guy again and give him a second chance? I don’t know what to do.. maybe I am just destined to be miserable.",
    "I am 16 and own a 66/80cc 2 cycle motorized bicycle I recently came across an issue with my carburetor leaking fuel due to the float needle not stopping the flow of gas coming from my tank, therefore, causing the carb to overflow. I did not know how to fix this issue so I installed a flow valve on my fuel line with the flow valve installed I can turn on and off the gas flow to the carb. To fix my issue I turn on the fuel valve thus allowing gas to flow into my carb and once the carb starts to leak I turn it off, now that I have my carb filled with gas I can ride my bike for about 2 to 3 miles before running out of gas in my carb I then fill it back up by turning on my fuel valve. I know this is not the best solution and am probably decreasing my engine's life span but it is all that I came up with. I then thought why not get rid of my gas tank altogether and just oversize my carb's float bowl. Please let me know what you guys think of this idea and if I should patent it or not.",
    "Just something that came to me recently while thinking of the past games I've played. My first console game was My Street for the PS2, which was a fun minigame fest with games like RC Kart, Dodgeball, and Volleyball. I spent so many hours playing My Street with my brothers and even just by myself against the CPUs. And looking at the games I like now, I can say My Street has definitely influenced my preferences. I love games like Mario Party and Mario Kart, and the LittleBigPlanet series was one of my favorites to play and explore all the custom worlds other players made. So I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences with their first video game and their video game preferences.",
    "I started self harm from 6th grade. It got to a point where even if a tiny problem would arise in my life, I would turn towards my razor. It was my guilty pleasure and it turned into an addiction. I couldn't function at that point without this. Fast forward a few years later, and I'm trying to give up my addiction. It isnt easy and 4 to 5 months pass and I get stressed to a point that I cannot handle it and I relapse. I've been thinking that whenever this happens, I look towards my razor, but should I instead go for Vaping? I know my parents will never allow it because I live in a society where mental health is disregarded and mental disorders are not real. But still, if I were to ever get my hands on a vape, should I? I get stressed like that once every 4 5 months so I will not be smoking constantly. However I will still have an exit ready for me. Is it worth it?",

Having  a good enough body but just a smaller chest with inverted nipples , he made me feel little about my 2 insecurities and never enough . I still held on until now but I’ve begun to question is it worth it ? Will someone love me better ?

    "Sooo you know how every character has 3 lives in the Dream Smp? How did they get those 3 lives in the first place? What if the second and third lives are just copies of the FIRST life. You may say this makes no sense but how do you just die and come back all fine with all your memories? Also there is a book called the revive book on the server which only dream possesses and has been used TWICE. Once on Tommy and once on Henry his pet cow. Which shows that the revive book can be used multiple times and the person you used it on gains all their memories after revival. So what if you can revive the \"copies\" or your \"lives\" that you have lost through the revive book basically creating infinite copies of you with all your memories. I mean they have to go some where right? The dead have to go somewhere RIGHT? Comment on this post if you think this theory is viable or its just bs. Also I have another question that is how or who created/found the revive book and gave it to Jschlatt who then gave it to Dream?",

While we were FaceTiming each other, one of her guy friends asked to call her and she asked me if it was ok for her to answer.

    "So I've recently finished The Betrayal of Jimmy and played halfway through Jimmy's Vendetta. The missions are actually awful and some are even ripoffs of the main storyline, the Chinese restaurant shooting for example. Also what does it mean that they are in an alternate timeline? Why does the Mafia universe have different timelines? There also isn't any real lore, which was the strength of the main campaign. Instead we got a few scenes and a character we know very little about and isn't even connected to anything in the main story. The only positive thing to say is that you can explore the open world after the campaign is finished, which is one of my few points of criticism in the main storyline. How can those DLCs be so bad and boring. Should I even try to continue or should I cancel playing them? Also what about Joe's Adventures? Is it also worth playing, or is it as bad as the Jimmy DLCs?",

It's stupid but I thought of using text to speech and just having a static image of my face, but i can't even do that cause the text to speech for my language is horrible.

I really like the owner and wouldn't want to screw him over when the time does come to leave. When accepting a new position, how do you go about the whole two week notice thing? Are employers actually cool with saying,\" Oh I can start in two weeks.\"? It feels to me like an employer might be upset or go with someone else if you can't start soon/immediately, but that may not really be the case in the professional world.

    "Title pretty much explains it all, my cat hates his wet food. I know wet food is much better for cats than the dry stuff, but my little guys just won’t eat it 95% of the time, I put it out and he turns his head an walks away. I’ve tried many many different types of food, and he doesn’t like any of it. He absolutely loves the dry stuff though, sits there and meows and begs for it constantly. After a while of him not eating the wet stuff I usually end up caving and giving him the dry stuff cause, obviously, I don’t want him to starve. I know cats are supposed to eat the wet stuff, that’s where they get most of their fluids from and it’s just better in general, so I’d like to get him to eat it, but he just outright refuses most of the time. On the rare occasion he does eat it, he’ll just eat like half and then leave the rest. What the heck can I do? Should I just give up on the wet stuff and only give him dry? He does have a fancy little water fountain that I see him drinking out of, so I know he isn’t dehydrated, but the lack of eating good food is a bit concerning. He’s about 5 years old, and has kind of always been this way, but recently has gotten worse. I even bought him some special bowls because I was worried it might be whisker fatigue, but that hasn’t helped either. If anybody had any advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",

All I could think of was you. I wish I could take you out for eel sushi, and I’d get your favorite beer, and your favorite bread. It would be so worth it to know you’re eating properly and see the huge smile you get on your face whenever you have your favorite food. We could do something really special together. Now thinking of that money opens up a pit in my stomach I’ve tried to think of something else to use it on but it all pales compared to you.

I hope no one said anything rude. I pray for your safety every day. I can never stop loving you, and I don’t think I’ll ever climb out of this dark pit.

    "So I’ve been learning the basics of forex and when to take trades through IM academy. Basically I know more or less when to take a trade through hourglass using the Cashtrap strategy. It shows you possible trades you could take. The educator says that just using indicators on hourglass you could win 60-70% of your trades. I’ve learned the point system they use to have more confirmations to know whether or not a trade is good to take or not. The problem I’m having is that the educators seem to kinda of repeat themselves over and over and I don’t think I’m learning anything more than what they are saying. They are trying to pass it off as something so simple when in actuality it’s not. I follow the strategy exactly how it was taught but I still seem to lose. I paid a lot of money to learn this and it’s starting to feel like a scam almost. I understand that the market does it’s own thing and you can’t predict right every trade but following everything I’ve been taught I still can’t seem to predict right. I have good and bad days but it’s confusing to know where I should be placing trades and I feel helpless because the educators are on repeat mode every time they go live.",

    "Now I know Victreebel can get swords dance and everything good mainly in postgame of fire red making the only real moveset I want to go with for him is razor leaf, body slam, toxic or acid, and maybe double team or rest. Victreebel isn’t the best in the older gens or maybe he is I have no idea. But I’d love to know what you think maybe I can give him other moves I’m deciding on either him or exeggutor and I really don’t know what else to use the rest of my team is gonna be Charizard, Primeape, Lapras, Raichu, and Nidoking and Victreebel is getting the 6th spot if I can find him viable, this is for ingame only also and I have access to get a bellsprout cause my brother has leaf green, I’d love to hear what you guys think and thanks.",
    "my best friend would always comment on my moms ass, tits, etc. he would always say how he fucks her yk the usual shit. until i came home early from playing basketball and i see my best friends car in the driveway. i go inside and it’s quiet but my moms home bc of covid. i go into her room to ask why he’s here to see my childhood best friend fucking my mom. she hurried for her clothes and that’s when i saw his dick. it had to have been at least 9 inches while i’m only 3 inches. while my moms rushing for clothes he tells her to stop and that he wants to see what’s in my pants. my mom didn’t say anything and neither did i do he came over and choked me against the wall and dropped my pants. he made my own mom take a picture or our dicks next to each other and then told me he wants to keep fuckign my mom. obviously i said no and we were going back and forth until he just holds me down and ties me up with bedsheets. he forced me to watch him fuck my own mom. she loves every part of it and was so surprised to see how much bigger his dick was",
    "I just watched fragment of trash taste how they lambasted Kazuya for that thing with not running after Mizuhara and i m wondering... I know when i started reading i felt he was pain in the ass but kinda understand where all those things he did come from and just gave him some pass. His pervert side is still annoying but i feel like it is author trying to be  funny but failing mostly. Otherwise he is really great later on even this situation when he said sorry to Mizuhara for not running after her made me sad for the guy and later on there where more moments where i really felt some emotions after him trying to open himself or trying to be brave. Is it really that bad in anime or am i just incel feeling bad for other incel ? I felt really down in my life for quite some time so i relate to characters with low self esteem especially this low like Kazuya, because it's uplifting when he tries to fight for himself out there.",
    "Ages ago it has its battery changed; after it wouldn’t turn on with the battery plugged in nor would the battery take any charge. It has done little other than sit since unused since then. Recently I decided I’d try using it so I readied a bootable El Capitan usb as it’s hard drive is completely blank, but the MacBook wouldn’t turn on. I eventually found out that holding down the power button for 10 seconds and then plugging it in continuing to hold down the power button for another 10 seconds. When it does turn on the fans are full blast and whether it’s to El Capitan install, High Sierra install, internet recovery, or the hard drive from a know working MacBook it will only make it a little past halfway before shutting off and coming back on again only to repeat. If it is turned off anyway other than when it shuts itself off the 20 second power button thing has to be done again. I’ve tried an nvram/pram reset and the option+command+shift+power to no avail. On the inside there’s no evidence of water damage. I’ve been trying at it for two days now and I’m out of ideas as to what the problem could be.",
    "I feel so incredibly anxious. I can’t sit still. After a rollercoaster emotionally abusive relationship that lasted two years and after 1 year sharing an apartment together, I moved across the country for a while. After a month of not seeing him, I’m back. I’m seeing him tonight. The level of anxiety I feel is unreal. I can’t sit still for more than a few moments without feeling nauseated with unease. We wanted to meet up to get closure for everything that happened, but it was a toxic relationship. He begged for me back a week ago and has been standoffish the last few days. He told me he’s incredibly depressed and wants to want to seek help, but it seems that he won’t. He’s erratic in his communication and seemingly his feelings toward me. He says he feels like it’s going to be weird to see each other and I feel the same, to an extent. Despite everything he’s done and everything that’s happened, I miss him and am excited to see him. I don’t know whether or not that’s wrong.. people who are close to me tell me that I shouldn’t see him at all. I can’t help but feel drawn to him, even if it’s for the last time. Advice on how to handle this situation?",
    "Started a new job, its kinda scary not physically knowing who your teammates are. I mean chat chat pero iba pa din like 1st day at sabay-sabay kayo kakain, tatawa kayo pag lahat kayo nahihirapan, etc. It kinda feels like on your own dba. Parang zoom meetings feel awkward din, saglint lng and like its kinda different din like having the vibe of someone working beside you and making chikka. Its awkward just inviting people na \"hey magzoom tayo para lng may presensya\" and it doesnt feel the same. Anyone who can give advice on how to handle this scenario? I guess its the feeling of uneasiness din sa new role, new company and before pandemic, hadn't realize the value of having people starting with you.",
    "Their motivation is pretty weak to be honest and Marvel's attempt to connect their motivation with \"The Blip\" makes absolutely zero sense either.  Like what motivated them to do what they do in the show? We got a glimpse of it like wanting the life before the blip to come back and \"blip refugees\". Why are the blip refugees struggling exactly? Why the life after the blip sucks even more? I'm not saying that every single question have to be answered ,but the way they try to make the audience sympathize with the Flagsmashers just doesn't work. Maybe they could have showed us a small glimp of the struggles people faced after the blip and the struggles the blip refugees are going through ,but none of it was hinted properly at all. It was just \"bad\" things that's happening and we're supposed to relate with that suddenly.",
    "I am like 90% sure Isayama was made to make the ending more digestable. Why, you ask? All we have to do is look at the Season 2 ED. EVERYTHING is a reference there, EVEN THE FUCKING BABY is in there. Do you know what was in there that we've never seen? The mass of people wandering away. Those surely had to be the collossals turning back. This in itself is not the reason why many people dislike the ending, but I can surely say that some things were fucked with, and I doubt that that was the only one. I can even imagine some executive telling him literally after 138 that \"yeah man your shits fucked up no way we can have those characters die. figure it out\" Jean and Connie were brought back without even them getting brought back. They just kind of.. appeared? I don't know, maybe it's just my last dose of copium, but I am convinced that this was not that was envisioned.",
    "I am about a month into this hobby. I got myself a giant trance x. I walk with a cane do to a hip injury I received from a motorcycle accident when I was younger. Over the last year I have lost 168 lbs and wanted to strengthen my leg muscles before my hip replacement surgery. I told my doc I want you to have to work to get to my hip after I put on all this muscles lol. My legs were so weak. I started riding a beach cruiser about 8 months ago and was able to build up to a 20 mile ride, but I was limited on where I could go because of not having gears. Now I have open up so many doors with this bike. Me and my brother did our first climb two days ago. Holy crap that was one hell of a workout. It is a 14 mile ride with elevation gains of 2200 feet. We were only able to do like four miles with a gain of like 500 feet. The ride down just from that far up the hill got me hooked. This hill now has become my unfinished quest and i will beat it. It feels so good to have purpose again in my life and to seek out these challenges that are hard instead of running away from the hard things like I use to do.",
    "Title basically. I have an iPod Mini I recently upgraded, swapping out the 4 gig hard drive for a much larger compactflash card and it's eventual home will be a little cabin I'm building on a plot of land out in the middle of nowhere. It's being stuffed full of audiobooks and radio plays, including from my sizable Audible collection. At the moment I'm downloading my books, converting to MP3, splitting into chapters and then putting on the mini. This is mostly automated for me with the toolchain I've put together with shell scripts, but still takes a pretty long time. The mini is compatible with Audible formats 2, 3 and 4 which would greatly simplify things into drag and drop but for the life of me I can't get audible's servers to spit out the old formats. Is it impossible or is there a trick I'm missing?",
    "Just got home from a visit with my GI doc. Wasn’t even a visit, it was more of a lecture. He canceled my GES. I’ve been waiting for it for so long. He says that he found that I am lactose intolerant and that must be what is causing my symptoms. I was on a lactose free diet and I saw no fucking difference. Lactose intolerance isn’t nausea every single moment of your life. Lactose intolerance isn’t eating and vomiting the undigested food a couple hours later. He didn’t even give a shit about how much weight I’ve lost. I was so fucking overweight before my symptoms and now I can barely get it above 105 lbs. I’m not fucking crazy. I went to that appointment so bloated that I looked pregnant. Nobody listens. My mom doesn’t care. My dads a doctor and even HE won’t listen to me. He says he doesn’t want me on gut stimulators because I’m under 18 and they cause abdominal pain. Abdominal pain? That’s my middle name at this point. My mom is calling my primary doctor now to adjust my anxiety meds because I broke down when we left that appointment. Wanna know why I’m anxious and depressed? BECAUSE OF THIS FUCKING HEALTH CONDITION. GOD DAMN IT. What the hell do I do? Do I need to say my symptoms in French since nobody seems to understand them in English? Why won’t anyone listen to me?😭",
    "I know that I am overly quiet in social situations, and that it’s because a lot of the time I overthink anything I might say. Most of the time it keeps me from saying anything at all. I feel like it makes people think I’m stuck up or unapproachable. People tend to fill in the blanks if you know what I mean. A lot of people will say I should try not to think so much and just say the first thing that comes to mind, but the thing is on those rare occasions where I don’t overthink too much and start to get comfortable so I actually talk to people I feel like a lot of the time I’m awkward, and in ways I can’t always quite put my finger on either. Like I put my foot in my mouth or overshare or just say odd things that people don’t know how to respond to. It all makes me cringe and go back into that overthinking mode and I feel socially inept. It makes me want to cry and be a hermit. I don’t know what I’m looking for here, maybe I just need to vent. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "So this post is going to be somewhat of a jumbled mess as I dictated in my car as I’m driving from my iPhone but I just had a thought after reading some news about student loan forgiveness and with all the money that’s been spent through the government I think there’s an agenda in motion to cancel Fiat currency and the future is going to be only a Cryptocurrency somewhat like China just did. the United States will probably create its own so I don’t know where that leaves all the currencies that we have now but I think it’s important that we invest as much as we can into these currency’s now. I can see the US dollar becoming worthless and these things come quicker than we realize it could happen within a year could happen within 10 years we don’t know my advice to everybody is put everything that you feel comfortable putting in the crypto currencies as you can. And thank you for reading this if you did. And please comment your thoughts",
    "Honestly, the storyline I'm most worried about in the show is the shipwreck storyline with Matthias and Nina. All the other storylines in the show, including the crows, tie in to Alina's story, and are all connected. But I feel like, especially for new viewers, the Helnik storyline is just gonna feel like a random shipwreck in a random part of the world with two random characters who we don't really care about and have nothing to do with the main storyline with Alina. I just feel like it will feel a bit random and disconnected to the rest of the plot, especially considering all the other plots are connected. Maybe they have come up with a sensible way to believably tie them together, but even then it doesn't really look like nina and matthias is gonna interact with or even meet any of the other characters, unless it's just one scene at the beginning or the ending. I think I am most worried about the fact that new viewers are gonna be confused and not really care about the storyline at all.",

Because of this I have found cooking and cleaning very difficult, almost impossible.  This had lead to me needing to order out almost every meal. Funds are dwindling and I'm getting extremely overwhelmed. I've been finding it very difficult to even keep trying. I've been in too much pain to effectively  take care of myself.

I feel like I can't even talk to my partner because they keep recommending therapy and while I know they aren't my therapist sometimes I just need to talk to someone. I moved to a new state in order to be with my partner a few years ago and have struggled hard with making new friends, got a better paying but less satisfying job, we're even expecting our first kid soon.

    "I don't want to be like this - I'm too old for this shit. I don't want to spend the rest of my life posting about my heartaches. I don't romanticize heartbreaks. I dont intentionally torture myself with thoughts of you, they just come to me - like a thief in the night, leaving me robbed and helpless. There's nothing sweet about this and I'm far too logical for this. I don't enjoy wracking my brain, trying to find words that would best describe how I feel - and every time failing because no words could really come close to how gut wrenching, soul destroying this is. I put into words how I feel because supposedly it helps - I haven't seen any result yet at all. There's only one thing that would help me - and that only comprises of three letters - YOU. I'm so fed up with myself. I have no fucking illusions, no grandiose dreams of getting back together, of a happily ever after. I've lived in the fairy tale we have created long enough - and I'm living now my reality. I'm tired to my bones of feeling this way...I just want to move on. I'm not harboring any negative thoughts about you or about myself - no blaming, it is what it is. Some relationships are not meant to last, and some people are not meant to be together. That is life and I'm well too aware of it. But fuuuuuck, the pain. I just want it to stop. Now. Not when I'm six feet under the ground and I wouldn't give a fuck at all. I don't want to continue going through this anymore. I have accepted that we are not meant to be. I'm not angry about that. Just please, let me be free of this pain. Cause I just can't anymore.",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country. Personally, I think the trans-atlantic alliance must end and we should go back into isolationism.",

    "When my son was seven I took him to Dover Castle.  Neither he or I were aware of specific hauntings at the castle prior to the visit.  After a great day we returned home.  On tucking my son up in bed that night we chatted about the day and he asked me about a woman he’d seen dressed in a long red dress.  I thought it odd, although he was clearly not scared but more intrigued by her enough to ask me who she was.    I had not seen anyone matching the description although had been with my son throughout the day.   I thought nothing about it until a day or two later when, out of general curiosity I googled the castle and discovered that it is famous for being haunted with several ghosts one of which was a lady in a long red dress exactly where my son had seen her.",

I just tried another movie tonight and I had it set to direct stream, but it failed converting again. I had the mode set to auto, so I changed it to force and it loaded up super fast but said it couldn't detect any audio. So it played the direct stream 35mbps 4k beautifully, but without sound.

The thing is when I pee I don’t feel any burning it comes out normally. But after I pee i still feel the pain maybe even worse. It also feels like I have to pee when I don’t. It just feels all inflamed and burning inside of there. It’s been going on for I’d say 5-6 days now. The worse part is I’m on vacation and dealing with this sucks, I can’t even relax on vacation. I’ve had a hard time sleeping too. I made a doctors appointment for Monday. I’m just trying to see if anyone else experienced these symptoms.  It was worse when I took CBD too thought it would help. I’ve also been peeing a lot since this started too I guess my body is trying to flush this out if it is something.",

The recent 1.2 patch made it so you can make the “key item” icon on Johnny’s gear disappear by collecting all of his stuff and getting the Breathtaking achievement. Thing is if you decide to upgrade his gear from rare to epic then the epic version will have the “key item” icon and you won’t be able to get rid of them. Same thing if you upgrade the epic version to legendary. What you need to do is upgrade the rare version into epic then epic version into legendary before you get his pistol. Once you get the pistol all three versions in your inventory will have the “key item” icon removed from them. Then you’ll be able to delete them or store them in your stash or do whatever you want with them.",
    "I do group therapy with my family because my family is screwed up especially my dad and brother and every session ends with them blaming me for something and trying to convince the therapist I'm horrible. Recently they talked about how I dont enjoy doing chores, I dont do them because i score very high in school and it's very stressful. My therapist says they need to control me more. Keep in mind this is the person that's supposed to help me. Fast forward a week I pass my learners permit test, this day is probaly the only day I've been genuinely happy in about a month, and when I come home my dad just tells me to take out the trash. I tell him \" I'm eating right now, I'll take it out when I'm done eating\" and my dad is very childish and he likes control. So of course being the lazy fat and impatient dad he is, he says \"no do it right now\" so I say \"listen, i just got my permit, you are not going to ruin this day for me.\" And he says \"take it out by 5 30\". So I take it out because I'm not lazy like him, and now I'm mad and stressed out when I should be happy. I havent been happy for like 2 months and he ruins it. Take your own trash out you imbecile. Time to wait 2 more months to be happy, who knows if he will ruin it that time too.",
    "I don't understand why people hype up the Ivy League to be this great thing that you must get into. I personally didn't apply to any. Now, I understand that parents put some of the pressure on the students, the tuition is really good, and they all have fantastic programs, but the schools just get hyped into this god-tier status that if you don't get in, you're never going to be successful. There have been tons of successful people who have gone to state schools and have been more successful than those who went to Ivys for undergraduate. If you don't believe me, do a quick google search. Furthermore, jobs don't care about where you went to undergraduate. They care about what experience you have. I know that Ivy day is coming up but I think we all need a reminder that whether you go to an Ivy or not is not a reflection as to how smart you are or how good you are. Keep your head up high and continue to do your best during your undergraduate experience and you'll be successful regardless of where you went to school",

For the past three years or so, I have been consistently getting choppy haircuts with chunky layers that need to be fixed every time. I just got a haircut yesterday. The top 2/3 of my hair looks fine, but the bottom third looks about half as thick and very choppy and bizarre. I’m going to have to cut it again. I haven’t been able to grow my hair past shoulder length because this keeps happening. There’s no way that I just have bad luck picking hair dressers. It has to be something about my hair causing this, I just can’t for the life of me figure out why or how. Does anyone have any ideas at all? Has anyone else experienced this?",
    "In my opinion Charmx isn’t leaving. The fact that it still shows that he still has 2.4K videos is pretty fishy, they could all possibly be unlisted or maybe deleted which could suck for him. My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

    "Whilst playing in the Great War mod I was loosing a war of attrition. The allies had pushed me back almost to Berlin but then I mounted a massive counter attack on the Eastern front and reached all the way to Stalingrad which capitulated Russia. I was pleased to have so much land after such a long war. However, my happiness was short lived as I was slapped in the face by the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. But still I mounted a western front counter attack and pushed the allies back to the Benelux border. My attacks were green across the bord and the troops I had spent the last year preparing were making short work of the entente. But then suddenly out of nowhere I get hit by the Versailles treaty.

    "Hey everyone, what are some tips and advice on how to make your body smell extremely good 24/7? I would like recommendations from diets to deodorants to which fabric softener or detergent to use to wash your clothes, which product to use on your face and hair, which body wash, body lotions, body oils, perfume, showering technique, dental hygeine, flossing technique, anything, to use to make your body and mouth smell like heaven. I can make my hair smell really good, I use Amike Soulfood nourishing hair mask, Morrocanoil leave-in conditioner, Morrocanoil treatment, and Briogeo Anti-Frizz heat protectant. I have been complimented on the smell of my hair multiple times but I do not know how to make my body smell very good. Does anyone have any good body wash recommendations, body lotions, body oils, or perfumes to make yourself smell really good? Has anyone been complimented on smelling good all the time, and if so, what do you use? I have heard the Yves Saint Lauren perfume is amazing and I will buy that, but I was also thinking of just using something to smell good all the time naturally, not exactly with perfumes all the time. And by smelling good, I mean I really want people to constantly compliment me on how good I smell when they get closer, I am not really talking about just preventing from smelling bad or smelling neutral, or decent, but just smelling really good. Let me know, thank you.",
    "So last night my roommates, some friends, and I were having a good time having a bonfire. I decided to get wonky for the social gathering so I kept going back inside to my room to snort more ket. We have like 5 snakes and my roommate was showing one of our guests her snakes but one of them nudged the heat lamp keeping them warm when they were going back outside to the fire. Some time passes and I decided to go inside and snort some more ket. But when I go inside it smelled like something was burning but I didn't think much of it since we were having a bon fire. I proceeded to my room until I got near the reptile room and saw a bunch of smoke in that area. I freaked out and looked for the source and saw it had something to do with the heat lamp. I was so wonked I really didn't know what was starting to burn and catch on fire but I immediately ran back outside to inform my roommates something was catching on fire. They come inside and fixed the situation. Man, that was a close call. Thank god for my ketamine addiction and that I decided to get wonky af that night. I could've not have a place to live today if I didn't want to go back inside to continue the wonk. I just felt the need to share this with everyone. Thank you guys for listening to my experience last night. That was pretty scary when I finally thought about it.",
    "Our relationship is already stressed, and she is going through that phase everyone goes through where if someone dares correct her or politely inform her that she is making a mistake she blows up. I’ve done everything I can, and managed to find a ten gallon. It used to be in a five gallon, and a ten gallon was all I could find for her considering I’m broke from my own gosh and she wasn’t putting any effort into it. She comes to me with her fish problems but doesn’t listen to my advice when she hasn’t asked for it in regards to her fish’ safety. She told me a couple minutes ago that his stomach was looking a little big, he hasnt been swimming around much any more, and he isn’t eating as much/ at all. Tomorrow morning I convinced her to put him into a smaller container for a bit so I can get a good look at him and take a picture. Any suggestions?",
    "I’m still struggling in some aspects of the therapy. I’ve got the Amara View mask, which is comfortable enough. No problems falling asleep. Not snoring, which is great. AHI is generally between 4 and 8 while I can keep it on. But if the thing, Philips Dreamstation, goes 12 or over, i cannot breath out and end up almost choking on my own air. Doesn’t happen regularly. Maybe 2x in the last 2 weeks. I get a good, solid 3 hours after I initially fall asleep. After that, i’m usually up like at least 2 or 3 times and, recently, take the thing off after i hit about 4.5-5 hours just to get some sort of sleep. I don’t THINK i’m having claustrophobia issues. I’ve never had issues with claustrophobia in any other situations. I’m struggling to function during the day more now than before i started on the CPAP. I don’t know. I’m venting more than anything.",
    "Those of you in condo's and detached homes in Victoria, That have mini split heat pumps. How loud is your compressor unit outdoor? We had a two head unit mini split installed in August and it is loud as heck. The installer came out multiple times. Of course every time they came the unit wouldn't make the noise. It happens more at night and when it's really cold. I know they make noise but I feel like the amount of noise this unit makes is substantially louder than it should be. A friend of ours had one put in by the same installer. And his is whisper quite. I'm at my wits end on what to do. The installer keeps saying it's normal noise. But when the tv volume had to be turned up to drown out the noise of the outdoor unit. I feel like that's excessive.",
    "It gives me extreme anxiety when people come toward me for a hug or high-five. This is because everyone seems to do hugs or high-fives differently. In the milliseconds before someone hugs me, I think through how I will have to hold my arms, if they are going one arm up and one down or both up or both down or a side hug. For high-fives, it’s the same issue. Some people will grab your hand when you high-five, others have a weird pull you in for a hug thing, some grab your hand after slapping it and shake it or something. Anytime someone high-fives me, they look at me as if I am retarded when I try for a normal high-five because I don’t know what sort of weird-ass high-five they will try for. Sorry this is so long.",
    "I bought my first truck recently. It belonged to my dad’s boss who pretty much babies his vehicles. Only he let this sit for about a year. I got a pretty good deal on it considering which I wouldn’t normally do if my dad didn’t trust the guy. I couldn’t take it home at first because we found a fuel line leak. We repaired it and we jumped it and it ran really good. Until it died on an exit ramp. We got it towed home and it hasn’t started since. We’ve replaced the batter and now the ignition coil. It will turn over but it just won’t start. It’s an electrical problem because I’m not getting sparks from the ignition coil, hence the replacement. But still nothing. If I can’t get it fixed, the guy said he’ll take it back and give me my money back but damn I really want this damn thing to start. I hate that I can’t drive it or do anything with it",

    "I think when modeling for games the modifier aspect and the non destructive workflow puts blender above most 3D packages in this regard. One thing that is essential though when working with a high to low poly workflow is keeping the geometry relatively simple and be able to adjust it without having edgeloops around every corner. Maya's crease set tool was very good at that and I wonder why someone has not released an addon for that yet, I would really pay any amount for such tool since it would speed my workflow a lot. Don't tell me that you can do this using vertex groups cause it just doesn't make the cut, is too messy and the values of the crease get lost when you start to have a more complex model. Maybe it is too difficult to create? I would be happy to fund it. Let me know what you think.",
    "Signed up for Fraser’s HWPO app and was looking forward to it but it’s been a complete disappointment so far. Didn’t get a password email like the first email today said I would. Figured out I could do a password reset and get into the app. Got into the app and didn’t have the program in there. Checked back a bit later and it had shown up so got my hopes up that issues were over. Not so much. App is SUPER slow, nothing will load and all I can get to is a list of “Day 1, Day2, etc” if I click them it just spins and loads. Has been a complete let down so far. I’ve used various fitness apps before and all of them have been pretty decent and seem to be built on a pre-canned template app that whatever celeb throws their name on and was expecting similar for this one but not so much. This is like a freshman programming class tried to do a school project and failed at it hard. Anyone else get different results?",
    "Like two months ago I was using my newly acquired prostate vibrator, so to get things into perspective I was laying in my back inside my bed just chilling with the vibrator in while I tried to meditate and then suddenly, out of fucking nowhere a huge wave from my prostate flew through my whole body, it was so fucking pleasurable and only took like 4 seconds it even made me open my mouth as if I was about to moan, never had anything like it again, no cum came out it was just so good, after those pleasurable 4 seconds I thought \"I have no idea of what the fuck that was but I loved it\", that shit is the only reason I am still into prostate play cause after that until now I have felt nothing from it again not even a p wave I think, am I doing something wrong, and for God's sake someone tell me what the fuck that was",
    "One time I went to a party in Dahlonega, we started out at Taco Mac getting really drunk. I started getting really frisky so the two guys I was there with took me out back to where their truck was parked, turn down the music in there truck, and we started our own party. Of course I started taking my clothes off and dancing for everybody that had gathered. I brought one guy up on the bed of the truck with me and started putting his hands all over me. Eventually he started touching me and feeling me up, he took off my pants and started finger me in front of everybody. And his buddy got up on the truck push me down on my knees and stuck its dick in my mouth. They put me down on all fours and spit roasted me for a while... Then other people started climbing on the truck, a few other women took off their clothes and we all started sucking each other. Mostly us girls and the guys watching sucking on each other's tits, licking each other's pussy, trying to fit as many fingers as we could inside each other. But some guys were still up in the truck fucking us and putting bottles in us, and other things they were finding, not quite sure what was inside me at some points. But of course someone had to spoil the fun and eventually the cops showed and threatened to start arresting people if we didn’t pack it up.",
    "So recently all my purchased cards vanished from the client. I believe this had something to do with unlinking my original metamask address. I did this through support after linking my hardware wallet, as nothing has been minted yet I assumed all the cards would be minted to my new address. Apparently I was wrong, support didnt answer my questions about if unlinking my old address would have any negative side effects, they just did it and closed the case. They wont reply now the cards are gone and still havent replied after I made a new support ticket. I have relinked the old address to see if that would bring them back, but nope. Some people on here suggested I try the discord but that hasnt worked either. Starting to feel like I'm up shit creek without a paddle here.",
    "For a couple years now my 2009 v star 1100 was having trouble starting.  I would have to roll on the throttle slightly for it to start.  I recently found out that is a horrible thing to do on the v star.  All my research led me to find out that the tps sensor was the culprit.  To be in spec the tps sensor ohms have to be between 500 and 800.  Mine at its lowest setting was 1150.  I read multiple posts where people paid $165 for a new sensor and its was still out of spec.  The bracket that the sensor screws into is big enough to drill new holes right next to the existing ones so that the sensor can turn more and be within the proper range.  I drilled the new holes and tapped it with an M4 tap with 0.75 pitch.  It worked and the hard starting is fixed.nice to get the old girl back to normal.  I love the V star 1100 but pretty said that Yamaha made the sensor out of spec.",
    "Usually I play on PS4, but I still own my PS3 and recently installed it in the living room so my roommate and I could use it as a dvd player and we could play some old games together. However, when I wanted to let her play Journey, I found out the game disappeared from my ps3, I also cannot find it in my list of purchased games in my PS account either. The only evidence I have of ever owning the game on ps3 is a confirmation e-mail from the PS store when I bought it years ago and some trophies I earned are still listed on my profile. Has the game disappeared for anybody else? Does this have to do with PlayStation ending PS3 support? I apologize if this is not the place to ask this question, but I’m unable to contact PS support in my own country at the moment because they are “too busy”...",
    "Easter night. 98 years old. I got to hold her hand, touch her hair, and kiss her forehead. I got to say goodbye hours before she passed. I took pictures of her photos hanging on her walls, I took in the smell of her bedroom, I walked around her kitchen with family one last time. It was such a beautiful day, perfect weather, the sun was shining, birds were chirping. My aunt said to me \"when I hear the birds sing, I'll always remember mom.\" It broke my heart. I love my grandma. I love my family. Every family has its problems, I learned so much just from sitting and listening to my aunts and uncle talk that those problems just didn't matter. We are family. They had so much wisdom and love to give to me. They knew I wasn't very close with her, but they let me sit as long as I needed with her. I'm so happy I didn't wait any longer to see her. My brothers didn't get to say goodbye, only me. I feel lucky to have looked into those blue eyes one last time. I know she loved me and I love her. Rest easy Nan, tell Papa and Nick we love and miss them dearly.",
    "My son just turned 5 a couple of weeks ago. We always give kisses and hugs but I told him for awhile now that I don't want him to kiss me on the lips. I use the term inappropriate because it's the best way I know how to put it for him to understand. He sees me kiss my husband tonight and he said that I shouldn't kiss daddy on the lips. I explained that because mommy and daddy are husband and wife that it's okay. I told him that if he ever gets a wife, he can kiss her on the lips too. And he simply said \"or him\". I told him that is exactly right. He can love whoever he loves. I'm so proud that he even thought to say that because he has been around a few trans people but never a gay couple before. Love is love little dude. ❤",
    "Fast food has some kind of backroom deal with the pickle industry. Notice the hamburger pickle chips sold at the store are far thicker than the pickles on fast food burgers? They are also packed in a weaker brine, so the thick consumer chips require much higher brine content to maintain the pickle flavor. So while fast food gets paper thin, moist but not drenched, just as flavorful pickle slices: consumers are left with thick, sloppy pickle chips. It affects the profile of the burger. How many times has pickle juice washed your toppings off your burger, left your burger too high profile to add the other toppings you wanted, made such a mess with all the juice that anything else on your plate was ruined, or just made it impossible to hold your burger together with a couple of 1/3\" thick sponges slipping around on top drenching everything anytime you tried to grip it? If consumers had access to fast food pickles, they wouldn't rely on the fast food industry for low profile, topping worthy, manageable burgers. How entrenched is this conspiracy? Go to your local deli, buy one of those boars head pickles they have sitting in a jar on the counter, ask the guy to slice it thin with the deli meat slicer. They won't do it. Or go to Sam's Club and try to find fast food style pickles. You won't. All they offer is the thick consumer quality ones you can get at the grocery store. Even though their target customer is small business owners, they know regular consumers shop there too, and they won't risk any of us having access to fast food thin sliced pickles.",
    "The depersonalisation/derealization is increasing. Ive been mentally ill since i was 13, im now 23. The worst its ever been was in 2016/2017, and now its coming back severely. In 2017 i was diagnosed bipolar type 2, but my psychiatrists evaluation was short and he suspected schizophrenic psychosis as well. In other words schizoaffective disorder. I have a lot of trauma and cptsd symptoms. Ive painted since i was 5, and i cant describe with words all of the fantasy and creativity i have stuck inside my head. My paintings went from realism mixed with surrealism and now an increase in surrealism because of my dreams. I dont relate to most in my age and it makes me lonely and isolated. Most people dont percieve the world like i do even though i know there are some out there. But i cant find them. As im writing this im experiencing deja vu. I remember writing this before. I can see into the future but no one would believe me if i told them even though i can even prove it sometimes. I feel like i might not make it past 30 and i feel like this world is more of an illusion than we like to admit, but it doesnt matter. Im just exhausted and i dont know what to do.

    "So I’m terribly , horridly , confused about my sexuality . I’m a very very curious person by nature . I’m curious about everything . I’m a 17 year old girl in a homophobic family if that’s relevant . However , my friends and schools have always been very friendly and I’ve never been told that gay people were wrong by them . Lots of my friends have been bi , and it’s made me curious . I’ve fantasized about girls when I was 14, and these fantasies were sexual in nature. I had “crushes” on girls though idk if I should call them that . It was more being shocked at their beauty , and kinda fantasizing about them . Although if I ever had to date a girl I’d pass . Kissing a girl seems interesting but not desirable . I’d do it out of curiosity idk if I’d legitimately like them . When I was around that age , I’d wanted to be gay . Like I know how weird that sounds but I’ve had pretty bad experiences with boys . Lots of very poor male role models in my life , and my mom is pretty anti guys and tells me how awful all men are , when I was growing up . Some lesbians try to make themselves like men and even marry one right ? Could the same thing happen in reverse ? Fake attraction fueled by desperation. As of now , I find women beautiful the way flowers are , its aesthetic . My “crush” was extremely beautiful but I wouldn’t do anything with her not really . I’m so confused .",
    "\"We knew that fans were hungry for more Survivor--and so were we. We looked at this group of players and thought, 'these guys came ready to play.' And as always, we have to stay a step ahead of them. So we decided, let's put the game on fast-forward. 'You think you can take your time figuring out your strategy and looking for idols? Think again. Everybody else is talking and somebody already found the idol. And if you blink, you're voted out.' I think it's the natural evolution of the game. The last few seasons, every single vote is complex. Every single Tribal Council, the gameplay is aggressive and has consequences. So this is almost a response to that. 'You wanna play hard from the beginning? Got it. We'll make it harder.'\"",
    "I just got a request to help out the child of a person I haven't talked in 18 years. This old and close friend's wife disliked me so I was already on limited contact. But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

    "so Im 21.  My friends are all my age or younger and we are in our 3rd year of college.  They LOVE to drink.  I have since fallen back from drinking, and that has made me realize that I have little to nothing in common with them.  I like my friends a lot, but recently I noticed they tend to ignore my invites to do things that dont involve going to booze late at night.  Even normal, fun things that most people would like to do they arent interested in and will ignore my offer.  I get liking to drink, but holy fuck it seems like its their whole life purpose to get drunk.  This is a very hard time to meet new people as well, so I kinda just feel lost.  When i talk to them sober/when were not drinking and partying our conversations suuuuuuuuck.  Its like I just met them but these are people ive known for 2+ years.  I got a job on the weekends, and so far Ive had more fun at work with my coworkers than I have with my friends.  It sucks.  Its so stupid that society expects college kids to all be wild, unhinged, borderline alcoholics.

There is no battle phase on my turn one, so after performing actions, I'd ask if he has a response and he'd say no. Ok, my board is set and I end on Bow Wow and one Prank Kid. He allows me to set backrow. I declare End Phase and he says he Nibs me at the end of my Main Phase. Can he do that, I gave him several chances within the main phase even after I completed my combo?

    "So, I just wanted to make a little post about the condition of atheists and how it's like being one in this country. First of all, it's quite disheartening to see that literally most of your country's population loathes you for your opinions and lack of belief in religion. In most social media groups of our country atheists are seen as outcasts. Most of us here are closeted atheists since there's a pretty massive chance that our families won't take this matter well. Moreover, there have been a number of brutal murders of atheists whose \"fault\" was expressing their opinions, which lead to their demise. In my opinion, freedom of speech doesn't exist here and it's despairing being in a country where you can be murdered for your opinions.",

Então tipo, eu falei pra ela, que eu tinha me comportado a semana passada e eu queria comer chocolate né, e que tipo, por mais que eu faça as coisas direito, a gente tem a necessidade de comer um doce de vez em quando. Aí ela ficou puta, começou falar que eu preferia os doces do que os amigos, e na real, pra mim os dois caminham lado a lado na vida. Se eu não como doce eu fico estressado e se eu não tenho amigos, eu me sinto sozinho, o que me deixa triste e me leva a comer doce pra maquiar a tristeza.

    "GB is what go me into my love for hot sauce. I have bought a lot of it over the years. Recently I've noticed some small changes. The red sauce no longer has Japanese chilli peppers in the ingredients. The green sauce no longer has Mojo. Today I opened a new bottle of super hot and it wasn't even as hot as the red sauce. I shook the hell out of it and tried some more. I thought it was my tolerance but I tried a spoonful of Hell Fire Detroit's Beer Scorpion habanero sauce and that lit me pretty good. Perhaps that batch or bottle just lacks heat? I know GB isn't doing a private reserve anymore. Maybe the ingredient changes were to save money. I'd honestly pay more for it if it meant keeping the OG recipes. Maybe Dexter is getting tired of running the company? Maybe he is going to sell it?

    "I regularly lose all kinds of attraction for everyone,meaning no sexual or romantic attraction to anyone,meaning no desire to date anyone and looking at content and people that usually would make me feel feel sexually attracted stops doing just that.Those phases usually last between 2 or 4 months and I'm always worried that that my attraction will never come back when I have those phrases,however up until now it always has.Im pretty sure it's not sexual dysfunction becuase that doesnt include loss of romantic attraction and it doesn't affect me in any physical way,its all psychological.Im also sure that I'm not asexual since I do feel all that attraction outside of those phases.I have tried researching my symptoms but I've never really found anything that would match,and it's just really worrying me and I dont even know if its abnormal or  just a normal part of puberty.I also marked it NSFW just to be sure.",
    "So I’ve noticed that viewer ship is all over the place depending on when I post or what I post. I just recently had posts get around 5000-54000 views. I posted again earlier in the morning and only got about 14 views. I’m wondering if when I posts effects my views as much as even the content I’m posting. I’ve also noticed people don’t really want to know about my life they would rather watch me do impulsive things that they more or less want to do but can’t go through with like dying my hair or making things that the audiences hobbies coincide with. The steps of getting viewer ship seems very difficult but also all over the place. Some people use hashtags some don’t but still get 1000’s of views. What constitutes as the perfect time, the perfect description with hashtags or even the best content for your demographic? I’ve definitely improved my viewership since the vine era but it’s all really an equation of when and what. At some point I’m really hoping to find what it is my followers or new viewers exactly want to see but until then I am still figuring it out. Has anyone noticed what seems the best time to post or even the best hashtags to use? What content seems to do better for newer users to help boost their platforms? Maybe some people could take a look at my platform and critique what I post so I can improve. tiktok: ",
    "I was talking with my therapist today about all of the judgements my JNMIL has about me.  We talked about how a lot of these judgements are at odds with one another and don’t make sense.   For example, following my DD’s birth she complained that I contribute nothing to my marriage or our finances, despite the fact that DH and I both work successful high paying jobs where I frequently earn more than him.   Then when i returned to work, she accused me of not caring about my DD’s wellbeing and being an awful mom. Despite knowing that these ideas literally don’t make sense when taken together, I still can’t help but let her get in my head.  My therapist asked why I thought that was and truly I can’t answer.  I’m curious, why do your MILs words/judgements bring you down?",
    "Reading a translation of Anabasis, I noticed that having escaped the Army of Artaxerxes, and made it through the Armenian mountain passes, the Ten Thousand encounter a reoccurring trope amongst the various Pontic peoples they encounter. There are multiple instances where the local villages flee their homes in the face of the oncoming army, and hole up in Strongholds/Citadels. From the book, it is my understanding that these are not populated settlements and are only occupied to wait out hostile forces. It also seems that they were built collectively between multiple villages rather than each village having its own small strong-point. What other sources, if any, reference this practice? Is there any evidence for these small strongholds? In the book, they are often taken by the greeks without a prolonged siege or any equipment so how sophisticated could they have been?",

    "After reading some of the reviews that trash this film I had to speak up.<br/><br/>This film is gritty and dirty. There is content which is not pleasant, swearing and violence amounts other things. What else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? Well more than that actually, it about choices and what you Choose! Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did. At no point did it ever say \"Look at this, its cool.\" For those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in Britain, not just Scotland. I being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.<br/><br/>That being said, those things do not take anything away from the film, the quality of plot and story, or the acting which is Stunning! Robert Carlise as Begbe was excellent, and Ewan MacGregor shined. Also the character Spud was worth a mention he really was quite good.<br/><br/>This film is in my Opinion a work of Genius, that represents the book accurately.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.",
    "Why the poor box office performance?  Why the bad reviews?  Why the bad word of mouth?  I really didn't see anything horrible about this movie!  First of all, it's a character-driven story.  There's little subplots involving jealousy and philandering, but it's not handled in a soapy fashion.  I didn't feel any of the characters were one-dimensional.<br/><br/>\nOf course, Mike Myers steals the show as the homosexual club owner Steve Rubell.  I don't know the real Steve Rubell, so you be the judge whether or not his performance was accurate, but I have to say that Myers did an incredible job!  And I'm not overstating the least bit!  You watch him in this movie and you totally forget that this is the same guy who played Austin Powers.  Not to say I didn't realize Myers had talent prior to watching this film.  He has definitely proven that he has talent as a comic actor, but I didn't know he had the chops to pull off a straight, dramatic role.  Even his accent sounds real, not the least bit phony.  I'm surprised Myers didn't even get an Oscar nod.  He should've at least gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Trust me--you will be blown away by his performance in this movie!<br/><br/>The music is great.  It's always great to reminisce to the great songs from the seventies.  Mark  Christopher nicely captured the whole rebellious atmosphere of 54.  We're given a taste of the drug addiction and even the sexual promiscuity that made the place famous--there's a scene where a couple shamelessly pounds away on the balcony.  I read one person's review, saying that this movie should've been an hour longer.  I find it ironic that people watch movies that are two and a half to three hours long and complain, \"Oh, this movie dragged!  Oh, this movie needed more editing!\" Yet they watch a succintly timed film like this and complain it's too short. This may not have been the most thorough examination of the famous nightclub, but I think it got to the point.  No reason why we have to go into every tiny detail.<br/><br/>This is a serious, dramatic film but it's also very entertaining.  I actually had a smile on my face when the movie ended.  It ended on a happy note without having that forced, schmaltzy Hollywood feel.  Plus, I really like that song \"Knock on Wood\" that they played over the credits.<br/><br/>\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",
    "The Silence of the Lambs is a timeless classic, whose more than adequate storytelling never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most entertaining but least fun films to watch all because of its disturbingly genius atmosphere.\nIt's masterfully acted, especially from Hopkins's side turning this film into a clever and unforgettable masterpiece. Even though Hopkins and Foster don't have much screentime together they still put on a show to remember. Aside from top of the line acting and the directing the script from Ted Tally's (based on the novel by Thomas Harris) is career-defining. From thriller to psychological horror, this movie handles the tone and atmosphere perfectly while switching between the two. In terms of being a psychological horror movie, it does it perfecting as it wraps itself around the viewers' head and proves that gore and blood aren't needed to scare an audience. Surprisingly (and deservedly) this film swooped all five major Oscar categories (Best actor, actress, director, screenplay and picture) even though it was released in February, a whole year before the academy awards.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable feat in film making and you be seen by everyone, a film lover or not. Shocking and suspenseful it is a thrill to behold.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10",
    "The best film in the era of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Supremely well acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize.

Realmete with this film you can compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly.",
    "I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.<br/><br/>\nIt is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. <br/><br/>As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see \"Hart's War\" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).<br/><br/>All in all, \"The Great Escape\" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",
    "Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel \"Hearts of darkness\" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.<br/><br/>The film has a simple premise, US Army Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into Cambodia through a river, to assassinate a renegade, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. It's an accessible premise, allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers, and yet this film is anything but shallow. It's a journey into madness and hysteria, an observation into the darkness of humanity. I could write a book analyzing this film, there's just so much to talk about. My interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find Kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character's inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie, dehumanization. The journey through the river is also reminiscent of Dante's perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. There are three major stops before Kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought, as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.<br/><br/>The first stop is with lieutenant Kilgore. That stop shows that Kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. Their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can't comprehend the consequences the war will bring. In one scene of the movie, the \"heroic\" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies, Captain Kilgore uses Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures Valkyries, he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. At this stage, although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy, they still understand the innocent.<br/><br/>The second stop is the USO show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. At this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself, becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. The soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. Now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.\nThe last stop before Kurtz is the Do-long Bridge and it's at this point that a soldier has gone too far, he's experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can't return to a normal state of mind.<br/><br/>The final stop on the journey is Kurtz, at this point only Willard and Kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness, the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. Kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. Bypassing the madness stage he's able to see the world for what it truly is, filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. Willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. He kills Kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. In the end Willard has a choice, succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken Kurtz's place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon, he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving Lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe, he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. Both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn't, they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.<br/><br/>The film presents this study of the human psyche through Carmine Coppola's eerie score, hypnotic images, and some haunting scenes, essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. It's here where Coppola succeeds the most. His ability to create a living \"hell\" is so amazing, and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. It provides a commentary on war and religion, making the subtext even vaster. The film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film's runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat, and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner, conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer's breath away. Coppola's direction transcends itself, the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows, most notable during Col. Kurtz's first appearance. The troubled production obviously didn't hurt the film at all, and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. Apocalypse Now is beautifully haunting, utterly hellish, terrifyingly intelligent, and magnificently wrought, it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war, but also its meaningfulness and beauty. Not only is this one of the best films ever made, it's a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. It is Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. Rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon, immortal for its contribution to cinema, and a truly unforgettable experience, Apocalypse Now is cinema at its most complete, crystalline and pure.",
    "After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions, ridiculous CG-assisted stunts and mindless action, I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better. <br/><br/>The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle. <br/><br/>De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots, but all are carefully tied into the through-line of the story to match the main character's progression. <br/><br/>The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story, The Bay of Pigs debacle, and traces the steps that lead to it, one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character, Edward Wilson, barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did (the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wire-rimmed or horn-rimmed glasses), but it didn't ruin the film for me. <br/><br/>Overall though, definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand, rather than forget.",
    "Well I guess it's official, I'm eating my words as we speak. Yeah, I'm the guy who doesn't like sequels and yet here I am giving positive ratings to Star Trek Into Darkness and now The Hangover Part III. It's scary to think of what I might do next. If the new Fast and the Furious movie impresses me, I guess I'll just skip reviewing it and go straight into denial. But seriously folks, I went into the new Hangover with really low expectations. We're talking bottom feeder if you know what I mean. So from now on I think that's the key. I'm going to take this approach with every film I see. That way I'll stroll out of the theater as a movie critic that raves about everything and comes off as not so darn grumpy. Whoa, forget what I just said. I was merely kidding people!<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what occurs in part III. At the very beginning, we find mentally unstable \"wolfpack\" member Alan (Zach Galifianakis getting the most exposure he's had in any of the Hangover films) buying a giraffe, putting it in the back of his truck, and killing it on the freeway (I'm thinking you know how it happened). Upon doing this, he irritates his family and draws concern from the other \"wolfpack\" members (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha). Everyone but Alan, stages an intervention on his behalf to get him to a treatment center somewhere in Arizona. He'll agree to go if his three buds will drive him there. As the four of them set out on a moderately short road trip, their car is rammed off the road, they are dragged out of it (held at gunpoint mind you), and one of the crew (Bartha of course) is taken hostage. This sets off a chain of events which leads everybody to venture back to good old Sin City.<br/><br/>Well let's get down to it. Right off the bat I want to let you know why I liked The Hangover Part III. I enjoyed it for the exact reason that some critics panned it. This flick doesn't try to be like the other two in the trilogy. In fact, it feels like a totally different animal all together. Yes there is a dash of the funny (something part I did effortlessly and part II attempted miserably), but there's also a hint of darkness that comes close to turning everything into a sort of black comedy with shards of mild violence. For me, this is an effective way to wrap things up (unless there is a part IV of course). You can tell that the director (Todd Phillips) wanted to avoid copping out and injected part III with a little more juice (this is the other reason I liked it and most critics didn't. They think Phillips went way over the top or felt he had to prove something). He did the film justice by avoiding the same tired plot line (everyone gets smashed and wakes up not knowing what the heck just happened) while making an effort to tie together loose ends from the other two movies (by way of flashbacks). This is done to effect in the first 15 minutes and it sets everything in motion.<br/><br/>The actors then promptly assume their personalities from the first two installments. Doug Billings who's never around for the debauchery, plays the happily married nice guy. Alan, plays the screw loose, borderline mental patient who nonchalantly goes about his business. Phil, is the smug, unhappily married school teacher who is calm under pressure, and Stu is the manic anxiety ridden dentist who thinks all hope is gone. Together they fit their roles like comfortable old shoes. Overall their performances are manically unhinged. You get what's required of them coupled with a fresher more potently nasty script this time around (part II's had lazy written all over it).<br/><br/>As far as supporting work goes, I thought John Goodman (gangster Marshall) was a nice little addition to the Hangover family (he riffs off his Big Lebowski character but just not quite as intense). I also like the addition of a love interest for Alan (someone besides man crush Phil) in Melissa McCarthy. She seems to make a cameo in everything these days and certainly is a hoot as a pawn shop owner who candidly berates her wheelchair confined mother.<br/><br/>The only setback for this Hangover is the blatant deviation from the focus of the four stars of the movie (the infamous \"wolfpack\"). This exercise is bent on giving two supporting characters their own vehicle (Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Galifianakis). True these guys are funny and steal many a scene, but the other members of the cast don't get a lot of room to breathe. They get kind of pushed to the side and become sort of frowned upon (Bradley Cooper recently got nominated for an Oscar, give him some props for gosh sakes). And what's with always having Justin Bartha's character not present with the other members of the \"pack\" when the madness of their misadventures is going down. It seems predetermined and silly. What, is he not good enough an actor to occupy some precious screen time with his buddies (Bartha was in the colossal flop Gigli (2003) so maybe that's it, who knows).<br/><br/>When it all comes down to it, I found myself at ease with the way part III whisked by. It's darker than the first one, funnier than the second one, and more daring than both of them. I laughed, I winced, and felt confident in recommending this hot mess of a movie. It's a sequel all right, but it tries really hard not to be one. I admire that. With nothing to lose, you should go check out The Hangover part III. It's a solid time killer and a required \"hair of the dog\" if you will.",
    "As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.<br/><br/>However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.<br/><br/>For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).<br/><br/>The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.<br/><br/>What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.",
    "I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as \"one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles\" and \"one of the classics of the 70's\". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a \"crazy house\" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.<br/><br/>What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.<br/><br/>-10/10",
    "I am an engineer working offshore in North Sea. I have seen the movie this evening in UK. Is really a good movie, congratulations to all involved you done a great job showing a little bit of ''life in offshore rig''. Looks like in this movie is BP fault but in real world at the rig site everyone has the right to STOP THE JOB if something is wrong or something is going on against the procedures. I have work before in BP rigs in North Sea and I stop the job when I wasn't happy with what is going on I had all the support from the Service Company that I am working for and also BP company understood my concerns. If you are a engineer, roughneck, derrick-man or whatever you are at Rig Site if you think that something is going wrong and against the procedures STOP THE JOB. I do it and I will do again better to lose my job than to see people dying.(Thanks for reading my review)",
    "Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.<br/><br/>Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.<br/><br/>Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.<br/><br/>I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.<br/><br/>I hope my talk helps.",
    "My name is Cecilia and being from Manila this film is very personal to me because my grandfather sacrificed his life during WWII. According to eyewitness accounts, he was tied to a post, doused with kerosene and set on fire. I am watching this film to somehow pay tribute to him and those who selflessly gave up their lives to ensure a free and humane future for all of us. I felt though that the film underestimated what we Filipinos really went through during the war. It would have been just to include the other atrocities perpetuated by the Japanese: babies thrown in the air and caught with bayonets, women brutally raped and breasts carved out, or the massacre of approximately 100,000 unarmed and innocent civilians during the battle for the liberation of Manila on the first days of February 1945. Nevertheless, I am grateful for director John Dahl for shedding light on a chapter in our history that many people hardly know about , specially the present generation, The Bataan Death March.",
    "After watching this movie I can say that no it is not as good as the original but that does mean that it is a bad movie. What I was really excited to see in this movie from the trailers was the scares and the demon nun Valak. The movie does not disappoint and can't wait to see the next entry in the conjuring series!",
    "`The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped, bound and gagged, into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most, if not all, of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet, Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving indifference, to be a criminal-type with a heart of gold, and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline, which exists merely as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed, well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright, sparkling sheen.   In fact, Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham, who makes for a very `cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",
    "Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!",
    "8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.<br/><br/>The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.<br/><br/>The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the \"Free World,\" are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.<br/><br/>Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.<br/><br/>All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.",
    "Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney.  That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist.  He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br/><br/>But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.  Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself.  Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!  Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.",
    "Dawn of the Dead<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.<br/><br/>And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>Grade: A-",
    "This film will generate anger because it throws a \"deadpan\" brick directly towards cultural dysfunction and mass delusion. \"War Machine,\" and Brad Pitt, even exceeded the deadpan message of \"Being There\" a film from a less cynical time in history but still relevant to this day. <br/><br/>\"War Machine\" does a great job illustrating how disconnected the every-man has become in relation to reality. We live in a time where facts are now selectively chosen to support forgone perspectives rather than being absolute, universal, and irrefutable. <br/><br/>We live in a time where personage, perceptions, and public relations matter more than overview, objectives, conclusions, and endpoints. Reality has been set adrift. <br/><br/>It was a brave thing to produce this film because it speaks to a very narrow audience. Most people won't be entertained by the communication mechanism (deadpan) nor will the understand the message. Few people will be open to perspectives other than those which are preconceived. Some people are not aware and thus cannot acknowledge the wounds and damage that political lies have done to the American process and psyche. <br/><br/>To conclude our failed state of affairs, the affairs of a failed nation state (our nation state) I am not with him because he is certainly not with me no matter how much he tells me otherwise. The cohesion of leadership, truth, and the American way has left the building.<br/><br/>It is more of a shame that people won't understand this film, or won't want to. And that is how far we have fallen. Perhaps Rome fell the same way on the sword and misadventure of its own lies and delusion.",
    "\"The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived, without wealth, without property, without official title or office.  Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies, nor the ruler of vast lands.  He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift.  Yet men, governments, dignitaries from all over the world, have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth, who led his country to freedom.\"<br/><br/>This quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film \"Gandhi\".  Richard Attenborough directed this massive epic about the man that freed India. The film opens with Gandhi's assassination.  The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi's funeral on January 31st, 1981, the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral.  It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation. This film was made before CGI (computer generated images), so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed.<br/><br/>\nMahatma Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art.  This film has made and will make millions of people aware of the little brown man that took on the British Empire and won.  \"Gandhi\" serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history.<br/><br/>\nBen Kingsley played Gandhi.  He was the perfect for the role.  He resembled the real Gandhi.  He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man. He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.   He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part. And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the \"big-time actor\" persona did not get in the way of viewing the film.  He did win both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor, for this role, which I agree he deserved.  He became Gandhi.<br/><br/>The cinematography was outstanding.  Attenborough filmed \"Gandhi\" on location in India.  The scenes of India are spectacular, and India is very much another character in the film.  This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi.  Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta.  It is suggested by Kingsley, on the DVD, that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming.  They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman.  Undeterred by their negative thinking, he persevered to enlist thousands of Indians to help make this film.  Every crowd scene, he used real Indians from the area. Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for everyone.  It should be required viewing in high schools, as part of History class.  The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant.  It is also a beautiful work of art.  This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood (see \"Pearl Harbor\" for that). Of course, it would have been hard to screw up a movie about such a great man. 10/10",
    "I walked into the movie theater expecting to see Adam Sandler make a complete buffoon of himself. However, when I came out I was impressed. There was a depth to this movie I did not see coming, and it took me completely off guard. \"Click\" proved to be a powerful, emotional, and humorous piece of work. There was a certain philosophical message in this movie, in which I think, we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work-aholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie, and in \"Click\" he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh. Definitely a 10/10 in my book.",
    "It's hard to say if is an improvement or not on the original, but it's certainly a good continuation of the story this time more focused on Alex's origin and life.

    "There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.<br/><br/>The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.<br/><br/>You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless. <br/><br/>The King's Speech boasts an exceptional cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.<br/><br/>The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year.",
    "I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.<br/><br/>10/10 Highly Recommended",
    "I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.<br/><br/>'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx (all good actresses) could respectively bring out the sweetness, vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy, humour, liveliness, enthusiasm and devotion (towards family) of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.<br/><br/>In addition, the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laugh-out-loud Bonnie Hunt, a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston, a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki (one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves)'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating oh-look-I'm-so-cute child models.<br/><br/>The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio, switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side, the wild and smooth cinematography, slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.<br/><br/>The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well, actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story.",
    "This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",
    "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. <br/><br/>This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. <br/><br/>The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. <br/><br/>The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. <br/><br/>I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.",
    "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.<br/><br/>But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.<br/><br/>I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date.",
    "When I see films like this, it really underlines the programmed ignorance of most Americans, and just how effective the government and the media are at shaping a false narrative. Al Qaeda was never an existential threat to America, and the Taliban was an internecine problem only to local Afghans and different Islamic sects. The conflict and motivation set up in this film is just ludicrous and phony. I am retired US Army, I still have contacts in the service who know the truth about Afghanistan. This film is a sham.",
    "Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for \"Airplane\", \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\", and the \"Naked Gun\" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody! <br/><br/>I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the \"Hotel Gay Schluffen\", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.<br/><br/>I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him afterwards!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If \"Top Secret!\" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means \"She whose bosoms defy gravity\"?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)<br/><br/>The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.<br/><br/>It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, but there's no doubt about it, \"Top Secret!\" IS one of the great comedies of our time.",
    "Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. \"When you re-write a script it gets better and better\" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like \"Nick of Time\" \"The Astronaut's Wife\" and \"Secret Window\" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a \"safe\", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!",
    "Heartbreaking yet captivating, Changeling's story was fascinating all the way through, even if the first half was a little slow. It certainly was a compelling story, shot beautifully, and written well. Angelina Jolie gave a mesmerizing performance as grief stricken Christine Collins, as well as the many young actors in the film. It's certainly worth the time.",
    "In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends because he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it was free, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.",
    "For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the characters in the movie. Sorry for those who's lives were so well protected that they've never been exposed to the likes of us but, that's how we talk and act. It's a type-A environment and we use it to protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.<br/><br/>I am well versed on the facts as provided by the MSM however, as someone in the biz I also know that the fly in the ointment are the facts.<br/><br/>1. The firing of mortars is an art and the mortar launcher has to be anchored to the ground or every mortar will land off target. The mortars landing on the CIA compound are dead accurate and also require spotters to assist with any corrections.<br/><br/>2. Aviano AB, Italy is about 2-hours away. Had they been launched, even if only to do a low fly-by, would have driven off the attackers; just like I used them in Iraq in Mosul, Tikrit, and Baghdad. I don't know why the Commander of the 555 (Triple Nickel) didn't launch. It's one of the big questions that remain unanswered by the media or the movie.<br/><br/>3. Hillary's statement that, \"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?\" was a red herring. Because it was neither. As later testimony bore out, it was a planned, coordinated, terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11.<br/><br/>4. All UAS aircraft are armed.

    "In the midst of the many wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick, it is strange to note how rarely people mention \"Barry Lyndon\".<br/><br/>The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.<br/><br/>Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in \"Barry Lyndon\" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.<br/><br/>The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.<br/><br/>\"Barry Lyndon is\", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them! KimotoCat",
    "It is too unbelievable and too lame. It is unfunny and like a cartoon that is on film.\nExaggeration is OK when it is interesting not when it is a spoof that takes itself seriously.",
    "When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.<br/><br/>Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots. <br/><br/>I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish \"whodunit\" as well. <br/><br/>Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as \"Del Spooner\", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in \"Enemy of the State\" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, \"Independence Day\" and \"Men in Black\". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.<br/><br/>A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. <br/><br/>The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a \"good guy\" or not. <br/><br/>This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.<br/><br/>Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the \"camera moving with moving object\" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment. <br/><br/>In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. <br/><br/>Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that \"I, Robot\" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.<br/><br/>Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie, any movie that gives you fun, drama, action, mystery, and makes you think is a great movie. Thank goodness I, Robot is all of the above.",
    "Being German I'm not really into the Hooligan way of life. I'm just fond of the Brit way of making films and this one is just brilliant. Of course you can argue about whether the director Nick Love is showing the life of some football thugs too positive and without the \"never do this, kids\" attitude, but...this is just a great piece of film. It has terrific acting (especially Frank Harper does a great job), splendid camera and editing and a more than suiting soundtrack. Watched it with some pals and it was just great fun. The scene where Rod tells his girlfriend's parents about his inner thoughts is a highlight. So if you're able to shut out all thoughts of moral and you're just interested in 90 minutes of quality film-making of today...watch this. It's definitely all worth it!",
    "A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Helen Mirren works a miracle with her characterization. When the Queen is forced by circumstances to address her people and mourn in public Diana's death, Helen Mirren doesn't forget that her character is a seasoned public speaker but not an actress. When she delivers her speech to her subjects, the real strength is in her commitment to her duty and not the meaning of her words. It is a chilling, masterful acting stroke. Stephen Frears uses the brilliantly structured script to reveal something that's always being in front of our eyes but we've never seen. The privacy of the most public people in the world. Michael Sheen is terrific as Blair and every piece of casting is truly inspired but it's Helen Mirren's film, oh yeah, one hundred per cent.",
    "Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.<br/><br/>The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous \"blondes\"), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.<br/><br/>\"To reveal more,\" as Leonard Maltin wrote, \"would be unthinkable.\"<br/><br/>While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!<br/><br/>One of the all-time greats. They definitely don't make them like this anymore.",
    "What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!<br/><br/>BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.<br/><br/>Go see this movie!",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "This of course is not a great movie but I just have to give it a 10/10. I have never laughed more in my life. Even the jokes that aren't funny are funny. This film's comedic build up is about the best you will ever see. It doesn't even matter what the punch line is, its how they get to it thats hilarious.<br/><br/>Now this cast was perfect. Anytime you have Randy Quaid in a film you just know the film is going to make you life just by looking at him. Kingpin couldn't have shown this any better as he plays an Amish man who just happens to be amazingly talented at bowling. Woody Harrelson plays a has-been ex-professional bowler who makes a comeback with managing through Randy Quaid. Together they go on a ride across the country making money left and right. Along the journey they are great supporting comedic performances given by Bill Murray and Vanessa Angel who certainly makes the look of the film more appealing.<br/><br/>The Farrelly brothers in my opinion give their best direction they've yet to have. Yet it is the writers who so perfectly set up one joke after another. It seems as if the script is so sharp that their are jokes within jokes. The Farrelly brother handle this material so well by virtual unknowns.<br/><br/>As I have said before this is not a great film but I would highly recommend this if your in the mood of watching something spontaneous. It may not be the most technically sound movie ever made or the deepest but I have never laughed so much in life and that in it self is what comedies are about.",
    "Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with Bill Murray losing his job, girlfriend, and apartment, all in the same day. He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups, exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, \"I think your ready for the Special Olympics!\" Harold also shines in a bit-part in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand, \"You speak some English?\" The student answers back \"SOB and $hit\" and the whole class than repeats it.<br/><br/>The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy joins the fun as likable, lovable \"Ox.\" There are the typical sex gags, simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.<br/><br/>After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine, having silly one-lines like, \"Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do.\" rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe, the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.",
    "I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\".",
    "Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****<br/><br/>What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.<br/><br/>In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. <br/><br/>Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. <br/><br/>Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. <br/><br/>We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. <br/><br/>These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. <br/><br/>Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. <br/><br/>Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>4/4",
    "Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.<br/><br/>Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.<br/><br/>Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.<br/><br/>The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!<br/><br/>This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.<br/><br/>PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive.",
    "The Auteurist Perspective - The most unorthodox way of viewing this picture is as a kind of formalist exercise. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has talked about his desire to make a film tailored exactly to the format of a Hollywood action movie, even going so far as to count the number of cuts and camera set-ups in the blockbusters he watched for research. Everything in the movie may be taking place within quotation marks, as in the melodramas of Douglas Sirk or, more obliquely, Gus van Sant's 'Psycho'. The film wants to be both an archetypal big sci-fi action movie whilst simultaneously a pastiche of the form. The gorgeously overblown shot of Ripley and Call standing amid the clouds at the film's close certainly suggests a playful tweaking of blockbuster bombast. However, the 'Alien' series may not be the most appropriate place for this experiment; the series is far more defined by spaces and silences than by frenetic action of the Bruckheimer variety. Even James Cameron's 'Aliens' is surprisingly slow in its build-up; by contrast, Resurrection's relentless pace becomes oddly monotonous and the film loses the distinctive texture Jeunet brings to it.<br/><br/>The Whedonite Perspective - The problems with the script are mostly additions or changes to Joss Whedon's original (which is available online). Whedon rightly made Ripley's resurrection the backbone for the story, finding new things to do with a character many believed had reached the end of her life, both literally and creatively. He also carefully fleshed out the supporting characters just enough to keep them interesting. There are small problems even in his original script - Purviss is sidelined when his predicament demands imaginative exploration, and the narrative is more linear than you'd expect from this writer. But it's the feeble alterations that damage the film - reducing characters like Hillard (in particular) to cyphers, changing the ending so the audience never gets to see earth (the only place, as Whedon instinctively understood, that the climax could possibly take place), and removing a lot of the texture of the setting, like the marijuana fields. 'I'm a stranger here myself' should have been one of the great closing lines in movie history, up there with 'Tomorrow is another day' and 'Shut up and deal', but the dialogue (Whedon's great strength) is mangled by a director working in his second language, and who seems to be paying more attention to the lighting anyway.<br/><br/>The Cynical Perspective - The 'Alien' series is, by this point, a cash cow that everyone involved wants to milk until it bleeds. 'Alien3' ended Ripley's story with an unflinching finality that 'Resurrection' can only cheapen, no matter how good it is. The hiring of a cult french director is a sop to the critics who lionise Scott and Fincher's contributions - and whilst prior instalments were filmed in England, this production was mounted in LA, for the convenience of everyone involved. It wouldn't do to make too much of an effort on what is, after all, the latest sausage on the string. The suits' only concern is the opening weekend; hence Winona, shoehorned in just in case Sigourney's box office draw is waning.<br/><br/>The Aesthetic Perspective - John Frizzell's score is the fourth classic in a row for the series; both lushly romantic and queasily menacing, it gives the film its own distinctive flavour. The production design is bold and distinctive, with perhaps a hint of playful parody (the sickly green light, the mad scientist outfits, the giant glass jars in the lab); the film looks like a comic strip version of its predecessors. Some of the direction is highly effective - the underwater sequence is devastatingly beautiful. The problem is the slightly over-ripe grotesquerie Jeunet brings out in the material, particularly in the way the cast is shot (Dominique Pinon looks like a malevolent garden gnome, Dan Hedaya resembles a sweaty gendarme). It sits uneasily with the straightforward disaster movie plot. The biggest miscalculation on the production front, however, is the Newborn. The thinking behind it - to give it an expressive face and thus complicate Ripley's (and our) emotional response to it - is sound enough, but it doesn't really come off in the finished creature, which looks like moldy old tissues clinging to a pipe-cleaner frame. Whedon's original conception of a white, red-veined alien of the traditional design might have worked more effectively, although even that might not have survived the aesthetic indignity of its impossible demise, getting sucked into space as a string of alien linguine.",
    "I've been slowly making my way through Guillermo del Toro's catalogue of movies and this is my first time watching Hell Boy. If you're a Del Toro fan, then this one won't disappoint. He's such a superior director - he adds artistry to this action film through his use of shot making, pacing and colour. At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself.",
    "George : Hey guys, remember that movie we all did a few years back called Ocean's Eleven?<br/><br/>Brad : Course we do, we had such a great time.<br/><br/>Julia : And let's not forget we made stacks of money on it. It was a hit!<br/><br/>George : Well here's an idea.Let's make a sequel!<br/><br/>Matt : Fantastic idea! I mean the first one had all of us in it but most of all it was directed, had cool music, had lots of us in it and had a great script.<br/><br/>Brad : The script? Oh yeah, the script, whatever.<br/><br/>Julia : Let's do it. Everyone will love seeing us mugging it up on the screen. Steven Soderbergh's a friend of mine so he'll love directing us again.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, he'll do it. He won't have to work too hard though because it's got us in it. In fact he can just stuff around and experiment with all sorts of stupid camera angles.<br/><br/>Matt : Won't that just confuse the audience and make them dizzy?<br/><br/>George : Stuff that! Just so long as everyone can make out it's us up there on the screen they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : And the music??<br/><br/>Brad : Pfft! Music? No one goes to the movies for music. They want to see stars. Like us! Let's just have any old stupid music for this one.<br/><br/>Matt : That's fine. What about the script?<br/><br/>Brad : What is it with you and the script? Hey here's an idea. Julia, you're so famous and wonderful<br/><br/>Julia : So are you Brad.<br/><br/>Brad : Thanks Julia. What I was saying was how about we have an entire sequence where your character pretends to be you! Everyone knows you're fantastic so they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great idea Brad. How do we fit that into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Julia! Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK. How about we get someone else as famous and wonderful as us to join in the cast? The audience will love that.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, let's get Bruce Willis in a pointless uncredited cameo. He's never been too fussy about what movies he's made before. He's bound to say yes.<br/><br/>Matt : How do we fit him into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Bruce Willis. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK, who else?<br/><br/>Brad : I'm way ahead of you here, Julia. I've got a famous wife so let's get someone who is famous and wonderful, with a famous husband and who they audience will love if they see her and I having a romantic scene.<br/><br/>All : Catherine Zeta Jones!<br/><br/>George : I'll call her and see. <br/><br/>(Ring Ring)<br/><br/>Catherine : Hello. George : Hi Catherine, George Clooney here. You might remember working with me in Intolerable Crueltythe audience loved it!<br/><br/>Catherine : Hi George. What's up?<br/><br/>George : We're making a sequel to Ocean's Eleven. It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt in it. How'd you like to be in it too?<br/><br/>Catherine : Yeah sure. What's it about?<br/><br/>George : Who cares?? It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt and you in it!!<br/><br/>Catherine : OK. But how about we film it in Europe? The audience will love that!<br/><br/>George : It's a deal. See ya.<br/><br/>Catherine : Bye<br/><br/>Julia : So how'd it go?<br/><br/>George : She's in AND she had a great idea. She reckons we could film it somewhere in Europe.<br/><br/>Brad : Fantastic!<br/><br/>Matt : So how does that fit into the script?<br/><br/>Julia : Who cares about the script!! It's got us in it! And anyone who liked Ocean's Eleven will get sucked into seeing it and by then it's too late for them to worry about the script because they've already paid their money.<br/><br/>George : And besides they'll love it because it's got me and Julia and Matt and Brad AND Catherine in it AND it will be filmed in Europe. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great. Let's do it!!<br/><br/>you get the idea.",
    "I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original – just: Wow!<br/><br/>It's clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the 'office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) – this movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for film geeks like me.

    "So once again, after the debacle of Prometheus, Ridley Scott has proved himself simultaneously a master of visuals and yet utterly incompetent when it comes to creating a believable Alien story.<br/><br/>The single biggest problem I had with Prometheus was the collection of imbeciles and weirdos that made up the crew, and one might have hoped that Mr Scott would have realised that himself and made amends this time round. Errr.... no, sadly not. Once again we're treated to a crew of simpletons who make THE MOST pathetic and unbelievable decisions possible. Are we really supposed to believe that a crew would just ditch it's primary mission (that we're told had been over 10 years in the planning to ensure their destination was safe, etc) just because they happened to stumble on a new planet purely by chance? Just plain ludicrous. And that's just the start. A few more examples :<br/><br/><ul><li>Assuming we suspend our disbelief and accept the whole \"let's risk all the colonists and everything we have planned for decades for to land on this new unknown planet instead\" premise, why do these alleged scientists once again TOTALLY disregard the need for any protective clothing? So no breathing equipment, nothing at all to protect them from any alien pathogens. Good thinking!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Faced with a choice of sending either an android, or pretty much the entire human crew with no protective gear, to investigate an alien world, who should go? Yeah that's right, send all the unprotected humans!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Choice of landing right near the source of the unknown signal, or land several miles away and in a foot of water despite there being solid and flat ground a few feet away? Yep, it's wet feet and a huge hike all round folks!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Little alien pods on this alien world puffing their alien spores into the air? Sure, just get your nose in there and have a good sniff. I'm sure it'll be fine!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crewmen get infected by said spores? Don't worry about any quarantine procedures, just carry them back to the ship while getting covered in their vomited-up blood.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alien organism just burst out of said infected crewman? Just open up the locked door and try to shoot it, but be careful you don't miss at point blank range and then slip up on the blood.... twice. (When that happened, people actually laughed in the cinema. I was half expecting a comedy sound effect the second time!)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tens of thousands of dead bodies, and an enormous dead city solely inhabited by David the android from the Prometheus mission, that the planetary scan managed to NOT pick up from orbit when determining the planet to be \"safe\"? No need to ask David what happened, just accept that it's all fine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dark basements to go into all on your own? Do it! Nothing bad will happen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Huge alien eggs opening in front of you? Just have a good look inside. What could possibly go wrong?!</li></ul><br/><br/>The list of stupid decisions just goes on and on AND ON!<br/><br/>While visually the film is generally excellent, the all-CGI-Alien was a huge let-down. Personally I found it considerably less convincing than the practical effects used in Alien and Aliens, which is unforgivable considering the creature is what these films are all about!<br/><br/>Additionally the crew, apart from being imbeciles (as is usual under Mr Scott's direction these days), are also completely forgettable. I saw this movie last night and I can't remember a single character's name today. The one exception is David/Walter, and once again Fassbender does a great job. (Perhaps that's why there's two of them - to make up for a lack of any other decent characters).<br/><br/>The other problem narrative-wise is that both Prometheus and Covenant have actually served to make the Alien universe much SMALLER in my opinion. In the original Alien and Aliens, the creature was just an unknown organism from the far reaches of the universe, and all the more scary because of it. (The same went for the Space Jockey for that matter). But these new movies have tried to tie it all back to humanity in some way - i.e. the Engineers (who are also the Space Jockeys) created both humanity and the black oil virus, and then the Xenomorph was apparently created by David (who was in turn created by man) somehow doing some genetic tinkering with the black oil and human DNA, while living in a cave and playing with his flute. Far from expanding the Alien universe, both these prequels have actually shrunk it by making man the centre of everything, while at the same time managing to sanitise and neuter one of the greatest movie creatures of all time. So what Ridley Scott is saying is that the entire Alien series and the iconic Xenomorph itself was just created by a deranged android with God/daddy issues. How very pathetic and disappointing. I personally hate it when movies try to explain everything to the millionth degree because it invariably ends up as a massive anticlimax. What was wrong with the Xenomorph just being some hideous unknown life-form from the far reaches of space???<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but there's a word limit here.<br/><br/>Lastly, the end is just pretty feeble and anticlimactic. The CG- Alien just kind of gets killed and that's it. And the *ahem* \"twist\" with David/Walter could be seen from a mile away, although David wouldn't have had anywhere near enough time to cut his own arm off and change his clothes and hairstyle.<br/><br/>Please PLEASE Mr Scott, stand aside and let Neill Blomkamp have his shot at an Aliens sequel.<br/><br/>A generous 2 Stars. One for the visuals that are once again gorgeous, and one for a great effort from Fassbender.",
    "Spectre was a classy action movie....making the expected James Bond signatures always look new. loved the suave and class of our favourite British spy. Daniel Craig just re-immersed us in giving us another classic to relish for years.",
    "I'll be honest, I don't think any of the reviewers that have given this movie 10 stars have seen any episodes of the show pre-2000.<br/><br/>I went into the movie thinking it would probably be decent. I figured it would probably be in the style of the newer episodes but with better overall material. That's pretty much how it turned out. Anyone who says it was a return to the older *better* Simpsons is kidding themselves.<br/><br/>The Simpsons greatness was based, in my opinion, on two things: characters that we imagine existing in our society (think the comic book guy, Moe, Flanders) and simply hilarious and very quotable lines. This formula has since been replaced by humor that is situationally based, and quite frankly, just not very funny.<br/><br/>I saw this movie yesterday afternoon, and I can hardly think of one line that had me cracking up. There were some funny moments, yes, but nothing comparable to the brilliant one-liners from the show's glory years.",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in \"Mrs Brown\". \"The Young Victoria\" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.<br/><br/>There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.<br/><br/>Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.<br/><br/>Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford's attempt on Victoria's life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria's accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a \"Regency Order\"; the Duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.<br/><br/>There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a \"Danger! Major cliché ahead!\" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in \"Moulin Rouge\").<br/><br/>The main reason for the film's success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make \"The Young Victoria\" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10",
    "While watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of films and TV shows from my youth, first was any of the original Godzilla films, the second, a TV show Ultra Man. The FX were way better here, but, it just made me think of them. I found the film entertaining, no Oscar winner, but, it was good. Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of course, rooting for the good guys.<br/><br/>I also had to think that mankind would have or could have thought of a better defense/offense weapon than giant robots. To bring a fight into the city would have cost trillions of dollars, perhaps Quadrillions of dollars. Okay, I'm reading way to much into it. Watch the movie, you will enjoy it.",
    "June 8, 2002 was an 80's renaissance for me. Playing an emulated ColecoVision on my PC, listening to Huey Lewis, Prince, and Men At Work, watching the A-Team on TNN, and seeing this film from 1989. I still enjoy the decade of feathered mullets, jerri-curled hair, acid-washed jeans, skinny ties, dominant pop music, and terrible fashions. The 90's will never have that to live down (except terrible fashions, but not as bad).<br/><br/>When Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure became the surprise hit of 1989, it made a star of everyone's favorite Lebanese-Canadian-U.S. rock 'n rolling actor, Keanu Reeves, who is one of the top stars at the box office today and one of the few likeable people in Tinseltown. It seems that he still carries a bit of Theodore \"Ted\" Logan in all his movies.<br/><br/>He and Alex Winter (an indie film dynamo) play Bill and Ted, a couple of 80's California dudes who want to start their own rock band (Wyld Stallyons). However, both are flunking in high school and will be expelled unless they get an A+ in history. To make matters worse, Ted will be sent to the military by his father, therefore squashing their dreams of rock stardom. Enter Rufus (George Carlin), a man from the future who plays Clarence to the boys George (shades of It's A Wonderful Life) who gives them a telephone booth. With it, they decide to use it to collect great historical figures and bring them to San Dimas, California to show them how mankind has evolved.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film holds up today. Bill and Ted are truly likeable boneheads and both Reeves and Winter deliver fine performances. Carlin is funny in his appearances, showing that he doesn't need trash-talk to be entertaining. The dialogue is truly amusing, probably because no one talks like that any more. The only weakness is that it's an 80's film, so if you didn't grow up in that era, you might not understand why there's music playing throughout the film, or why everyone looks and dresses so weird (yes, that's how everyone looked in the 1980's). The DVD version is quite nice, but it only has a trailer as a bonus. Still, a must watch, and much better than all the copycat films (including the horrible Dude, Where's My Car?). Party On!",
    "The future of movies doesn't seem too bright since all we're getting are remakes, adaptations and unnecessary prequels/sequels and that's why original stuff like SOURCE CODE can really make my day.<br/><br/>Honestly, the trailers and initial premise didn't seem promising; some soldier can travel back in time and has to stop an some evil terrorist from bombing America. At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it.<br/><br/>Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. <br/><br/>To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.",
    "\"The Godfather: Part II\" is a very suspenseful drama with a very exciting story, with great acting and great special effects. I would definitely recommend you watch this movie...but first watch the original classic from 1972 \"The Godfather\" . The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel.",
    "Well, I'll tell you what. I'm not a big fan of animated features but this one was a blast and a half. Just when I thought Flash the Sloth at the Zootown DMV couldn't be topped, we wind up meeting Mr. Big doing the Marlon Brando \"Godfather\" bit. I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn't run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn't stop laughing.<br/><br/>I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis's Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.<br/><br/>As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like 'being all you can be' and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I'll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - \"I want to try even though I could fail...\". It's a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don't measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message.",
    "I really enjoy the Star Trek TV series (original, TNG and DS9) and admit that I am late to this review. As much as I enjoy Star Trek and its ideals I had watched Star Wars The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams and I hated that. Star Wars rebooted with completely non-plot for pre-teens and one-liners, wise-cracks and plot holes so big that even Donald Trump's ego could drive through them was not for me.<br/><br/>So, anyway with a certain amount of hesitation I finally watched the reboot of Star Trek.... and it was as bad as I feared. Since it was expected I was not disappointed, but by gosh what is with the people who hire the director JJ Abrams? He makes every character a cartoon character. Never mind that the utopian and progressive society of the Federation is completely glossed over and ignored, but these characters with the formulaic backgrounds and corny lines and false tensions is just terrible. The Vulcans and Romulans' feud has never been as cliché-ridden I would say.<br/><br/>Look, I get it. People pay for reboots and remakes and sequels and so Hollywood serves them up (or is it the other way around?), but use some imagination, have one novel or original idea at least. I am too old for cartoons... which explains why I won't be watching the next Star Trek or fifteen Star Wars coming out. Obviously the director JJ Abrams is specialized in reboots and remakes and sequels and not original ideas.",
    "First off, let me state emphatically that I'm referring to the REAL version of the film, not the pathetic crippled creature distributed as \"Warriors of the Wind\" on video. Although I must admit that I first fell in love with the movie in that form, I have now seen the full subtitled version, and I place a hideous curse on those who hacked over 20 minutes from its running time.<br/><br/>Although the incredible \"Princess Mononoke\" later upstaged this early work in terms of art and detail, in many ways I still prefer \"Nausicaa\". Its imaginitive and well-conceived world puts me in mind of Dune with its feuding factions, its giant creatures, and its strong ecological message. Even with a rather long running time, the story moves very briskly (boiled down as it was from a very lengthy manga series). The music deserves special mention, as well, as it is a large step up from the electronic pop stylings of most anime.<br/><br/>If you can get your hands on a copy of the original version, you'll find it more than worth the effort.",
    "I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.",
    "SPOILER: This movie was just magical.<br/><br/>The Force has become like Harry Potter magic, with a new spell every day or so.<br/><br/>Rey is just magical. With practically training whatsoever she can take on Luke and Kylo and win.<br/><br/>Snoke is magical. He appeared out of nowhere in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi has such fantastic Force powers (never before seen in the entire Star Wars Universe) and yet can't tell when his protege is scheming to slice him in two (but could fell his every throught earlier, and even manipulate him and Rey's thoughts and get them to intergalactically Skype each other and even send water through space).<br/><br/>Luke is magical. He can magically project himself light years away and even bring solid things (the lucky dice) with him. Then dies magically for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Yoda is magical. His Force-ghost actually has more Force powers than when he was alive! Calling down lightning from the sky??? Heck, why don't the Jedi just do that when fighting on Tattooine or whatever? And if Force-ghosts still have Force powers why not the whole gang of Anakin, Ben and Yoda take on Snoke?<br/><br/>Rose is magical. She appears out of nowhere and just happens to go along with Finn on a completely unnecessary mission to find a code breaker, and find not one but TWO code breakers, one of which is in the SAME CELL as they are. I mean, is that magical or what?<br/><br/>Leia is magical. Previously in 7 movies only having the barest abilities in the Force, she now can survive in space for quite a long time and even open her eyes without getting them immediately frozen, and Force-Mary Poppins herself back to the space ship. Magical!<br/><br/>I could go on and on. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it's one shameless Deus Ex Machina after another. And don't even get me started on the stupid feminist nonsense, the inane attempt at comedy, the stupid characters who go nowhere in their characterisation, the stupid casino subplot, the stupid \"saving\" of Finn who wanted to sacrifice himself by Rose who magically now has feeling for him and both of them magically survive without getting shot at by the entire First Order army. Oops, I did go on and on.<br/><br/>If you make a movie, you need to make sure your movie stays in the universe it came from. Not invent new rules, new powers, new super villains, new behaviours from old characters, etc. out of bloody nowhere.",
    "A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>\nDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says \"Russell Crowe\", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a \"hunk\" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.<br/><br/>And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.<br/><br/>And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.<br/><br/>At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",
    "Tony D'Amato(Al Pacino) is the head coach of the Miami Sharks who are owned by the Christina Pagniacci(Cameron Diaz) who is using the Miami Franchise only for profit. Trouble stirs up after long time star quarterback Cap Rooney(Dennis Quaid)is injured along with his back up bringing in third string quarterback Willie Beamen(Jamie Foxx) who becomes the face of the franchise after having great game after great game. The only problem is that he plays only with his head and not with his heart, with an aging team that needs an emotional leader to guide them to victory. Also Starring: James Woods, Matthew Modine, LL Cool J, Bill Bellemy, Lawrence Taylor, Charelton Heston, Aaron Eckhart, and John C. McGinley.<br/><br/>In a cinema that rarely produces pro football movies, this is the cream of the crop. It captures the reality along with the heroic story of a nobody rising to the top. The movie is humorous, dramatic, and a thriller for all sports fans.<br/><br/>This is not only one of Oliver Stone's best films but this is also the start of Jamie Foxx's \"good\" acting career. Forget what the critics said about Collateral or Ray being the beginning for Jamie Foxx. It was Any Given Sunday. Willie Beaman is a complex character and Foxx nailed the part. He was magnificent. He played the part to perfection and out shined the great Al Pacino. The supporting cast was also incredible with great performances from Cameron Diaz, LL Cool J, James Woods, and surprisingly John C. McGinley. It is very rare to find a great dramatic football movie but this is definitely one those small few.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the greatest sports movies of all time and it is highly enjoyable for adult audiences.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.<br/><br/>No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that, you're probably going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.<br/><br/>No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.<br/><br/>The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.<br/><br/>Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.<br/><br/>It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.<br/><br/>That being said, the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.<br/><br/>I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed & bigger budgeted movies, it will be a movie like this one, that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.<br/><br/>And while we're at it, hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive, well acted portrayal.",
    "From hit or miss comedy to Get Out, Jordan Peele proves to us that he has certainly matured as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Get Out is one of the best and most refreshingly original horror movies in the last decade.\nRather than having in your face predictable jump scares and cheesy music, Get Out dwells on the mind and relies on the fear of the unknown while giving subtle messages on racism and what's it like to be black in America and for an anti-racism movie everything is handled very well due to Peele's great writing.\nAs I've already mentioned the best aspect of Get Out is the writing; the characters are intelligent people and behave like logical human beings instead of cliché horror movie idiots. Everything happens for a reason and there is a meaning behind everything. Also unlike other horror movie clichés Get Out doesn't fake its scares or replaces them with needless humour. Instead, the humour (mainly Lil Rel Howery's character) is perfectly balanced with the story and shows up at adequate times.<br/><br/>Creepy, unsettling and filled with brilliant performances (primarily from Daniel Kaluuya) and even better writing, Get Out perfectly represents the US society in its current era.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8+/10",
    "SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.<br/><br/>The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to \"weed out all non-hackers\". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes \"Cowboy\" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes \"Gomer Pyle\" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. <br/><br/>The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.<br/><br/>The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined \"hours of boredom, seconds of terror\" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. <br/><br/>'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the \"duality of Man\" according to Jung. 10/10",
    "Similar to the first Ice Age, the promotional material for the sequel was out in the theatres way in advance, and courtesy of the Scrat character too, up to its usual antics of getting to that elusive acorn. Here, Scrat opens the movie, and emulating the style of the first, he provides most of the laughs, also as an intermission from the actual scenes from the main cast.<br/><br/>Our gang of prehistoric animals are back - Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabre-tooth Tiger (Denis Leary). We learn that Sid has gone into the early childhood business, educating the young minds of pre-historic brats. However, I felt that this movie was somehow darker in tone than the original. While the original was one which dealt with hope, this one had its setting in extinction, disaster and death.<br/><br/>The valley which they live in is threatened by the melting ice, no thanks to global warming. So all the animals embark on a journey to salvation, to that rumored ark which will save them from the massive floods to come. Along the way, our trio meets up with another trio of characters, who were added to expand the cast, featuring 2 Possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), and another, but female, mammoth (Queen Latifah).<br/><br/>Needless to say, Manny's still anti-social, and Diego can't get along with those rascal possums who get on his nerves, and Sid's the \"philosopher\" ever providing the laughs. Various themes like romance (hey, we got 2 mammoths here), friendship, trust, and believing in oneself to overcome one's phobia get covered. Pretty wide scope, but they manage to fit in place nicely.<br/><br/>The villains in this sequel are pretty nasty, besides the looming natural disaster, we have two sea creatures with nasty teeth and attitude, as well as menacing vultures ever ready to pounce on the flesh of animals who have fallen.<br/><br/>But it's not all that bleak. Keep a lookout too for that mad sloth song-and-dance sequence, which has potential to become the next ear worm ala Madagascar's zany \"you-got-to-move-it\" song. The animation is as usual, top notch, and I just can't get enough of the photo-realistic ice and water landscape.<br/><br/>This is one piece of animation that doesn't rely too much on sight gags, of spoofing current affairs, but one filled with more witty dialogue and kept on an even keel with its interesting storyline. Though at times it might feel clichéd, somehow it excelled in its execution.<br/><br/>And that makes this sequel, as enjoyable as, if not better, than the original. Recommended stuff this week!",
    "I was a Texas Western graduate in 1966 and attended the school all four previous years that Don Haskins (\"the Bear\") coached the basketball team. Of course, Coach Haskins came to TWC in 1961 and built his team over 5 years, not in one year as the movie tells it. I went to every home game in 1965-66 and remember every one as if it were yesterday. I watched all of the away games that were televised, including all of the games the Miners played in the NCAA tournament. Even though the producers of \"Glory Road\" took considerable artistic license, the story is mostly true. Here are some facts. The Miners blew away fourth ranked Iowa during a holiday tournament that season. It wasn't even close as the movie depicts it. The great comeback was against New Mexico in the \"Pit\". When Hispanic guard David Palacio came in to play in the second half, the team seemed to settle down and came from a 20 point deficit to win in overtime. The incredibly close game, and probably best game in America that year between the true best college teams in America was the Regional final between third ranked TWC and fourth ranked Kansas (not #1 Kentucky and #2 Duke in the final four semifinal), when Jo Jo White made that last second basket in overtime with his foot on the base line. The Miners went on to beat Kansas 81-80 in double overtime. Then the Miners beat Utah in the first game of the final four. If white player Jerry Armstrong hadn't defended against Utah's great Jerry Chambers, a black player, the Miners probably wouldn't have made it to the championship game against Kentucky. Chambers was beating every defender badly, including Lattin, Shed, and Flournoy, until Armstrong was put in to cover him. Chambers finished with 38 points, mostly in the first half and was the tournament's MVP.<br/><br/>Coach Haskins is beloved by every El Pasoan, whether living in the city now or not, and is a true American treasure. It's wonderful for the rest of the country and the world to finally learn about \"the Bear\" and his great 1966 Miner team that El Paso has known and loved for 40 years. It's much more than a basketball story, it's a story about tolerance and what hard work and discipline can do through the leadership and determination of a great coach and human being.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, especially Josh Lucas' performance as \"the Bear\". His performance was spot on. The young actors playing on the team were outstanding. The early tensions shown between the black and white players in the movie did not exist according to the real players on that team. The book \"Glory Road\" is a must read, because it tells the true story told by \"the Bear\", Don Haskins, himself. I also recommend David Lattin's book \"Slam Dunk to Glory\". The producers should have shown the real life characters, including Coach Haskins, Pat Riley, and some of the actual 1966 players earlier in the credits, because most of the audiences leave the theater without knowing they're going to be interviewed. I thought that was the most interesting part of the movie. The movie and the story deserve a perfect 10. I hope it wins some awards.",
    "Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot in the way of story and character development, but suffice it to say, it serves its purpose. What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. The pop culture references are still present, but I found them to be more clever and funny this time around, and in much smaller amounts. I was smiling through virtually the entire film, and had about 5 or 6 hard laugh-out-loud moments throughout. As expected, I was also very impressed by the voice cast in this movie. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen's performance as B.O.B.. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway.<br/><br/>The 3D, while not used as effectively as it was in Coraline, is still one of the more impressive showcasings that I've seen, and that's largely due to the film's incredible action sequences. Seriously, this is some of the best action that I've seen in an animated film; as far as I'm concerned, it's right up there with that of The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Monsters vs. Aliens to be a surprisingly entertaining film, with clever and witty dialogue, as well as terrific action. I'm not usually in favor of sequels, but if they're able to keep it as balanced and charming, I would honestly like to see this become a successful, long-running franchise. Nice job, folks at DreamWorks Animation.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.<br/><br/>He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.<br/><br/>Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",
    "\"Not only is Singer's film-making aesthetically frustrating (lacking coherent visual rhythm) but his juvenile regard of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler -- one of 15 documented attempts -- is intellectually insulting...\" New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film.

A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in.

I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...<br/><br/>What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.<br/><br/>It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.<br/><br/>If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that \"I was on the edge of my seat\" throughout the second half of the film.<br/><br/>So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.",
    "This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "\"I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time\", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use \"the weapon\".<br/><br/>There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "I love watching movies that leave you just thinking at the end. This movie really did that. Now I'm not really sure why it has such bad reviews but i really liked it and would definitely recommend watching it. <br/><br/>Its not another end of the world movie where your main characters saves their family and end up surviving at the end, which is something i liked because it shows how Nick cages's character has to cope with knowing that him and his family will die and theirs no stopping it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ending and how everything comes together at the end to show that this is Gods doing. You would never expect that from the way its played out, other than the foreshadowing from his son talking about not believing god at the beginning",
    "The first time I saw this film, I was suitably impressed but found I couldn't enjoy it completely.  In order to keep up with the relentless pace of the plot, I didn't pay as much attention to the writing and the performances as I should have.  When it was over, I felt the breakneck pace of the story overshadowed the screenplay and acting, rendering the film an accomplished reprisal of fact but not much else.<br/><br/>What a difference a second viewing made.  My familiarity with the plot allowed me to appreciate all the finer details of the film.   Watching Redford and Hoffman's disciplined performances as Woodward and Bernstein, for instance, is like watching two expert tennis players work in tandem with one another.  When they act together, there is a delightful give-and-take, two masters working their way into a wonderful groove.  While they appear steady and reserved on the surface, the two actors radiate a noticeable undercurrent of excitement and dread, as if underneath their stern countenances they're screaming, \"Holy sh*t!  I can't believe we're doing this!!\"  Redford, not the strongest dramatic actor, finds his normal-guy niche here and gives one of his best performances.  Hoffman is equally strong, making even the simplest scene seem like a masterpiece (the \"count to 10\" phone scene comes to mind).<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Pakula communicates the idea of these two reporters being completely outnumbered by the people responsible for the Watergate break-in.  I loved the numerous overhead shots of Woodward and Bernstein that pull up, up, up, until they're nothing more than specks in the dirty streets of DC.  (This technique is also used in the classic scene where the two guys are searching through old records and the camera pulls up to the ceiling and shows them seated along the edge of a circular series of desks.)<br/><br/>The film rockets right along, leaving the viewers as excited over the reporters' discoveries as they are.  William Goldman's script helps in this regard, I think, sticking straight to the meat and cutting out any unnecessary roughage.  The dialogue gets right down to business while working in realistic vocal habits and the like.  Redford really captures this well (listen to his stammering and self-corrections when he talks on the phone to sources - great stuff!).<br/><br/>I can't recommend \"All the President's Men\" enough.  It's tightly-structured, fiercely-paced, and captivating as all get-out.  If necessary, watch it twice: once to find out who's who, the second time to savour the handiwork.  If you want to talk more about it, leave a red flag on the potted plant on your balcony.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "Definitely not my favorite of the 3 but it's hard when the first 2 were just that good. It still portrays well, from my historical knowledge, much of the struggle of the mob families to legitimize their business dealings and try to enjoy life in the later age of the mafia in America. Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films.",
    "Please take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really write reviews, but I really felt compelled to say something about this movie and it's decaying genre.<br/><br/>I'm conflicted, because I know my opinion is getting more and more jaded with every new superhero flick- but I am quickly reaching the end of my rope here. All these movies feel so predictable and cliché anymore, and as much as I truly want to enjoy them it is becoming more and more difficult.<br/><br/>The main actors in this movie were pretty good, but what can you do with yet another weak story that has already been rehashed in other films. The writing felt subpar, and in the end it came off as being full of gimmicks and convenient sub plot.<br/><br/>It just doesn't feel real anymore, it doesn't feel believable. It feels like a fantasy world created for superfans who never take a step back and critique.<br/><br/>These superhero movies are becoming more and more uninspired, and while I try to give them all a chance I am just getting tired of it all. It feels like the quality is being diluted, all that matters anymore is the quantity. All that matters is the money.<br/><br/>I still hold out hope- just look at the 'zombie' genre. Just because there is dilution within the genre doesn't mean a sporadic gem can't be made. However, if you are of a similar mindset as me, you might want to keep looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!",
    "No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in \"10 Rillington Place\" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in \"American Psycho\". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",
    "There are few elements that actually work in this prequel, but none of them are enough to compensate for the lack of creativity, poor execution, terrible writing and awful looking special effects, ruining what it could've been a potentially promising spin-off from a great character.",
    "Amistad is a very well crafted, well acted, and well told story. It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad 'mutiny', and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America's darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.<br/><br/>Amistad ranks as one of McConaughey's finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. <br/><br/>Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.",
    "A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands' competition.<br/><br/>Unbelievable? Yes. What's more unbelievable is that somehow the whole thing works  Jack Black's over-the-top enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, the edge-of-disaster suspense is continued throughout the length of the movie, and by the end the audience is so desperate to see how the kids (who they all play their own instruments by the way) perform in the concert that seat wetting would probably go unnoticed. Joan Cusack, as the gobsmacked headmistress, delivers a performance that is worth the price of your cinema ticket in itself. Achieving such tears-down-the cheeks laughter and adrenalin-packed excitement for air guitar music is nothing short of miraculous.<br/><br/>School of Rock is a movie that promises entertainment and delivers. Everything is as it says on the packet. For sheer feelgood factor, this movie is unbeatable  and you can even take the kids!",
    "No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. Because they don't need to. The Spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are. But that doesn't mean they should not try to. Why did this movie get made? Simple, Sam Raimi wasn't given enough time to make a fourth spider-man film so he quit, and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen. This movie wasn't made for any other reason.<br/><br/>First off, Peter Parker doesn't have a goal in this movie. At first its to find out what happened to his parents, which isn't explained in this movie. After half an hour he now tries to control his new powers, in scenes that don't help the audience. In the original spider-man, Peter learned about his powers in a controlled environment, he didn't beat up innocent people on a subway train. It's nice to know no one on that train reported that a man beat up five people while climbing walls. But Peter learning his powers can't be an entire focus in the movie, so we kill Uncle Ben. This time it doesn't work because the only reason Peter let the criminal get away was because Peter couldn't get a chocolate milk. To get so upset that he couldn't afford a chocolate milk that he would let a robber get away with the stores money is a contrivance in every way. So for about ten minutes Peters new goal is to bring uncle Ben's murderer to justice, let the police can't link all these look alike criminals spider-man does capture with the man who did kill peters uncle. After a while he just stops doing this, with no reason! And there is still about an hour left, so what are we going to do now? How about introduce that main villain you've been promising us? The Lizard is horribly written in every scene he's in. Why does he go to so much trouble to knock cars off of a bridge just to tell one guy (who is never seen afterwords) that their vaccine isn't ready yet? Because we needed another action scene. After that they bring up that the daily bugle wants pictures of the lizard, a point that doesn't amount to anything, except the lizard finding out who spider-man is. For someone as smart as Peter Parker has been set up to be it was really stupid for him to put his name on the camera he was using to take pictures of the lizard.<br/><br/>The climax doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first being this is the same climax we've seen in about four other superhero movies. The second one being there are no stakes. Only half of Manhattan would be infected 8 minutes after the lizard started his chemical missile, decreasing the people at risk greatly. Also THERE'S A CURE FOR THIS!! You know, the thing Gwen has been working on for the past 6 minutes? Whoever gets infected can just get the cure shot into them afterwords, and as of right now there are only 10 people infected, so why waster your time trying to put the cure into the missile that will stretch half of Manhattan and only effect 10 people?! <br/><br/>Gwen Stacy's dad dies and tells Peter to leave Gwen out of this, and proceeds to still date Gwen. What a great way to respect someone who died protecting people! Don't watch this movie, don't waste your time with this movie, even Spiderman 3 was better than this, so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy, at least those movies had effort put into them.",
    "I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. <br/><br/>I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "2012's Magic Mike wasn't exactly about the stripping. Sure, it features a lot of it, but the real center of the movie was the lifestyle of its main character, Mike. This latest installment showcases more of the crew and how they put up the show. It's more choreography driven than some commentary, which actually made it more appropriate to this material. It still has the stunning style of the first one, though it mostly feels quite forced, but if the movie tries to be itself, then there it actually shines. Magic Mike XXL indeed brings much of what you expect from it.<br/><br/>While the first movie basically shows the art of its aesthetics, this sequel rather shows the art of stripping. The story isn't quite remarkable; it's so simple that it's nothing more than an excuse to show more of these acts, which is both a good thing and otherwise. But really, that's what the target audience really came here for. Just like the first one, it's all atmosphere than following a plot. We just see these characters trying to get along, hint some commentary, and do some stripping. The difference however is the stripping is the real showcase, as in the direction and choreography improves within that aspect which makes these performances speak what this movie is truly about. People would immediately think that this would only appeal female viewers, but even as a straight man as I am, I would actually be impressed by the choreography displayed on those scenes.<br/><br/>The direction does try to keep Soderbergh's style going in this sequel, though only eschewing the intense sepia and welcoming other colors on the daylight. The new style is sometimes indefinite, specifically the vague lighting in some scenes, but then, the movie eventually breaks the pretense once the characters start dancing on screen, having more focus on their moves, and of course, bodies. Star, Channing Tatum, still has the charm as he always has. The other performers also get their characters expanded, staying natural whenever they bond and fight off on screen, treating them beyond than typical eye candy compared to the first one.<br/><br/>Many may call Magic Mike XXL a totally needless sequel or a cash grab for those who seek for more endless dose of shirtless men, but I believe this movie actually exists to make up for its own value. The story may not be as meaty as its predecessor's, but it shows everything what its audiences actually wanted for it. And it is done elegantly, proving that stripping apparently has more to offer than just lust for flesh. It sounds incredibly weird if you say it that way, but looking at these performances seems like this is an art that we didn't see coming. Again, there's nothing remarkable about the story, though if you're curious about the appeal of this career, then it gives a room for fascination.",
    "I give this movie a 10 because it has a message. It has a true purpose to it, which effects nearly every man on the planet.<br/><br/>Ladies, you can listen to this, but be reasonable. Guys, we all masturbate. Some of us do it more than others, most of us look at porn. Some of us only masturbate to porn and some of us have real hard fetishes.<br/><br/>This movie points to the problem, the process of porn turning our heads, making us believe in perfection and making us ultimately selfish as lovers.<br/><br/>You watch porn, you don't have to please a woman, you don't have to worry about anyone but yourself. It is all perfect. In the real world, in relationships, the other person matters just as much as you, but sometimes, even the real thing is not as good as the fantasy and the ease of it.<br/><br/>Don Jon is about that confusion of liking and appreciating porn more than real women, of becoming addicted to the idea of 'perfection' and the ultimate realization of the effect it has on all us men, making us irritated little boys, incapable of truly connecting with another person.<br/><br/>The message is not that porn is bad, only the way we think and use it is misleading to reality.<br/><br/>But, this is not the type of movie to watch with the family, the girl; it's funny, but not a comedy in a spoof and clown type of way. Watch this movie alone, think about yourself and how porn effects you. It will benefit you greatly.",
    "That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.<br/><br/>This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.<br/><br/>The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.<br/><br/>I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.<br/><br/>I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.<br/><br/>This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant \"hungry for more.\" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.<br/><br/>Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful.

    "\"Porn was pretty much our only interest, to the point that our only real hobbies were making porn with friends, watching porn, and making vore/gib porn. The main reason porn was our only big hobby is because we were pretty miserable in life. We were both depressed, we went to one of the most unliked high schools in our state, were extremely overweight, and didn't leave our homes unless it was to go to work. After we left high school and started attending university, we were still really lonely and unhappy. I felt like I was a huge waste of space, as I was extremely lonely and hated my classes, I didn't make many friends and felt like I was going to school just to waste time until I was done with school, because I didn't know what I wanted from school or life in general. I'm still pretty lost as to what I'm trying to accomplish with my life as an adult, even though I'm 24. I have a college degree I never wanted to get and have spent my entire working life doing jobs I hated just for a paycheck. I was so lonely and miserable I often couldn't sleep at night because I was crying so much due to my despair. There was a lot of self-harm and emotional struggles. However, it wasn't my depression that made me start porn, although it was a factor. The real problem was my boyfriend.\nMy boyfriend wasn't your average guy. He was so into porn he would watch at least one video a day, he would often try to talk me into watching things with him that I had no interest in, and he got so wrapped up in it he often would watch it in front of me at all hours of the night even though I told him I didn't want him watching porn when I was home and needed sleep. I'm a very private person and didn't approve of him watching pornography in front of me, especially if it included sex that I can't stand. I find things like intersex, transsexual women, asian pornography and feet just gross and disturbing, but I tolerate them for the sake of other things I love.\nI've never been a fan of feet. I don't get attraction to feet, although I do find the foot fetish to be a bit disturbing. I will tolerate them, but I never enjoy it and would rather have the screen off",
    "I've seen a lot of threads about people struggling with the past, but mine really puts me in an agony that seems unbearable. I don't know how familiar you are with regret, but my version seems to stick with me like my own shadow. It's under my dining table during breakfast and nestles next to me at bedtime. It's like a parasitic ghost, draining my energy, stealing innocent smiles, and replacing them with frowns of sorrow and blame.\n\nI don't laugh at things as easily as I used to, I don't enjoy heartily the way I used to. I find myself constantly questioning every decision I've made in the past which has led me to this point. Some of them may seem unimportant as they've been, for instance, conversations I've had that ended up hurting others without me realizing it until it was too late, or opportunities I passed up, which could've changed my life significantly.\n\nBut there are also ground shaking events that I still ponder upon. Failed relationships, family fallouts, vices I picked up and friends I've lost; I know I was the common variable in all these equations. I just can't seem to figure out why. So, I continue on this destructive streak of chronologically organizing my series of \"could have been\" situations, torturing myself every day with countless replays and rewinds.\n\nI've tried talking to people about it, trying to explain to them how deeply entrenched this loop is. But everyone simply attributes it to overthinking. They say things like \"just let it go,\" \"the past is the past,\" or \"you can't change anything now, so why bother?\" But they don't realize how much this negativity influences every new step I take in life. It seeps into new experiences, turning them into yet more memories to regret.\n\nI'm left feeling like I'm spiraling into a bottomless pit, weighed down by guilt and regret, unable to escape. Although I am desperate for a way out, I can't seem to find it. It's like I've been sentenced to lifetime imprisonment within the confines of my own reflective mind, and there's no parole in sight.\n\nI guess I'm seeking some reassurance that I'm not the only one dealing with this. Is there anyone else who feels like their past haunts them to this extent? Is it a common theme to constantly judge yourself, unable to forgive? How do you guys deal with this? I yearn deeply to create a better present, unshackled",

    "> My dog has gotten into an obsession with attacking a specific dog. It just doesn't make sense. The other dog is not aggressive at all; in fact, it never even reacts to the aggression shown towards it.\n> \n> There are 3 dogs in our family.

    "This study introduces two significant constructs, immediate snapshot complexes, and witness structures, which are notably instrumental in ending up with wise comprehension and conclusions in the realm of distributed computing. Initially, it explicates the chronological aspects and the ensuing practicality of immediate snapshot complexes in properly decoding and recording the system's operations. Subsequently, the paper delves into an in-depth dissection of the novel concept of witness structures, an advanced algorithm that authentically and accurately exhibits the system state. Both theoretical and experimental analyses are conducted to validate their properties and efficiency. With a central focus on their interdependence and their shared significance in distributed computing contexts, this paper fosters an advanced understanding of immediate snapshot complexes and witness structures, thereby paving the way for optimized algorithms, enhanced system performance, and improved error resilience.",

By scrutinizing the influential role of substrates, the study offers novel insights into manipulating magnetic dipole radiation effectively. The approach, comprising of rigorous theoretical analysis and computational simulations, broadens our understanding of dipole-substrate interactions, particularly for high-frequency radiation. Additionally, the article discusses possible applications in areas such as metamaterials, nanoantennas, and optoelectronic devices. This extensive study significantly underlines the potential of substrates to shape and control magnetic dipole radiation, opening up new possibilities for the design and development of advanced photonic devices.",
    "Annie Hall (1977)\nAnnie Hall is the definitive Woody Allen movie. In it Woody Allen (alias Alvy Singer) and Diane Keaton (alias Annie Hall) are the leading characters portraying lovers. The movie portrays the ups and downs of their relationship through funny scenes and humorous dialogues. The movie is set in NYC in the 70s, and the whole movie revolves around the relationship of their characters. The best scenes are the scenes during the opening and the end credits.\nThe movie is also the most iconic Woody Allen movie that can be compared to his earlier works. The scenes portray him as a neurotic, nervous, fearful, and timid. The movie’s whole plot revolves around his fear of being without Annie, not knowing what he will do if this occurs. When Annie Hall ends, he returns home. As Annie prepares to leave, Woody Allen says, “You can’t leave me like this, I’m not the same person anymore”; it is clear from this sentence that the relationship has completely changed him, which happens in all relationships.\nThere are two other themes expressed in the movie that were the same as Woody Allen’s earlier works. One theme that is expressed throughout the movie is the need for a sense of place. In this scene, Alvy is going through Annie Hall’s house. As he walks around the house, he points to Annie’s bedroom: “I had a dream once where I was in here, and the bed had just melted, you know”. He then goes on to tell her that this was before the days when she changed bedsheets and they still had the same sheets on. This scene explains how they still had not moved in together and were just living in her house.\nThe second theme that can be seen throughout the movie is the idea that love is a journey. As the movie progresses, it shows how it changes both of them; in the end, they realize how much they love each other. In the scene at the club, when Annie notices Alvy looking at her, she walks over to him, and he looks into her face. Annie then states “We’re going to get married, right?” Alvy responds “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you, but I’m pretty sure”.\nThe themes I find the funniest",

    "MANCHESTER UNITED'S attempts to sign Arsenal and England attacking midfielder Cesc Fabregas has not yet been met with a positive response, a source understands.The Spanish World Cup winner has just over a year to run on his Gunners contract and is no nearer to signing a new deal despite manager Arsene Wenger's public insistence that the 24-year-old will be staying at the club.Fabregas, who can leave Arsenal for nothing at the end of the season, has emerged as United's main midfield target this summer and manager Alex Ferguson wants to beat the current transfer record by making him the highest paid player in the club's history when he leaves.Arsenal were rocked this week when the Football Association made allegations of improper conduct over Fabregas' and Samir Nasri's failure to sign new deals.It is understood that no bid had been made from United and there would be no formal offer being made in the near future as they would like to see the position move to a more favourable position.If Fabregas wants to sign for Manchester United, that can be negotiated outside of the rules that exist now, the source said.Wenger has said Fabregas will not be sold before the end of the season and that he was not thinking of selling him yet. But the player has a year left on his contract and United could make an offer of more than the world record fee of £80m paid by Real Madrid for Cristiano Ronaldo.It is understood the position is not as clear cut as that. Wenger hopes and believes Fabregas will give a sign of where his future lies once the season is over.If he wants to sign a new deal he has said so. If he wants to leave, then that also has to be said.Ferguson will hope there will be an opening, if not with Fabregas then perhaps with another player. The source said: \"Wenger still believes this is his man, and he has said he wants him to stay and give his decision at the end of the year.\"He has not played Fabregas since that last game so there is no way that we know now that he is going to leave.\"A United source said: \"There is no offer in at the moment, it is all a bit premature.\"It is very much a case of wait and see.\"\nThe following is",

    "This is an odd family film starring Will Smith (who appears as the leader of a cult), Kate Hudson and Jennifer Lawrence, and was directed by Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings). \"Hansel & Gretel\" tells the story of young girls who, in their quest for a witch, end up being hunted by the Gestapo (the secret police).\n\nIn a way, the story is similar to the events in the recent film adaptation of \"The Girl On The Train,\" but \"Hansel & Gretel\" is more of a realistic dramatization since it is centered around young girls and there is a lot more bloodshed in it. \"Hansel & Gretel\" is the story of three girls: Gertrude (Hudson), Ruth (Smith) and Gretel (Lawrence); they were born in the year 1944, and they were all from the same family and lived in Switzerland. Ruth was the oldest of the three girls and as she grew up, she grew into an incredibly beautiful yet extremely poor woman; she suffered from a horrible illness due to which her face gradually wore away, eventually leaving only her eyes in the aftermath of the disease.\n\nWhen her family was moved to the United States, the girls were taken over by Jack Ruby, who trained them in the ways of witchcraft. Ruby, to start with, was a good witch and loved all children, but as time went on he turned into a ruthless cold-blooded murderer who would kill his victims with a baseball bat, and even though the three girls were eventually rescued by the French forces and managed to get back to Switzerland, after that they were forced to run away and hide among \"normal\" children. However, as they all grew older, they were confronted with the sad truth of what the world has lost; the world has not only lost what they call \"normal\" people but had also lost the pure, innocent people.\n\nThey go on to have a falling out amongst themselves and the world as they start to see that the only people who are pure and innocent from that era are no longer even that. It is only those two, Ruth and Gertrude, who are still with them when they come of age and it is Ruth, more so than Gertrude, who comes to realize what was lost at the time—what true friendship, what true love",
    "We study the Hamiltonian circle actions with minimal isolated fixed points (HIHS) which are a special class of the non-symmetric Hamiltonian circle actions (HCSA) [4]:\n\nIn general, HIHS are defined by two curves having equal radius. The distance between the centers of the two curves gives the minimum radius for the circle, and thus the circle action is non-isolated. The first term in Theorem 1 is a polynomial for i∈[1, 2) that is positive when the radius (or the average of the two curves) is smaller than N, and negative when the radius is larger and the first equation is equal to zero (where N is the size of the system.) By Theorem 1, when the minimum radius is R and 1 ≤ r < N, we obtain for each i∈[1, 2)\n\nIn particular, if n is the number of vertices, we define HIHS as the non-symmetric Hamiltonian circle actions with nisolated vertices, with ( R ≤ r ) ( = R − i ) ( = ( n + i 2 N ) N ) in which the vertices are uniformly distributed over their full area (see Fig. 1 below for an illustration of the non-isotropic nature of the Hamiltonian circle). In the following, we illustrate:\n\nFig. 1 Examples of HIHS with minimal isolated vertices. Arrows with vertical stroke denote the minimum radius R ; arrows with horizontal stroke denote the average of the two loops R + i 2 N defined over the area i.

    "This academic paper delves into the theory and application of Alpha Channeling with High-field Launch of Lower Hybrid Waves. It presents a novel strategy for direct conversion of alpha particle energy into useful radio frequency (RF) waves during fusion reactions. Techniques for launching high-field lower hybrid waves are explored, including how they can be used to modify plasma dynamics, guide alpha particles, and potentially increase the efficiency of fusion energy systems. Experimental data and theoretical models are used to evaluate the technical feasibility of this concept. The findings highlight the potential for high-field launch of lower hybrid waves to contribute to more efficient, sustainable fusion energy production. The paper concludes with implications for further research in plasma physics and fusion energy technology.",
    "A blind student at an American university has invented a system that could allow people with visual impairments to hear words in colour.\n\nKailash Ahluwalia's invention converts words into different audio frequencies for different colours.\n\nWhen he wears the device, each colour associated with a frequency hits him like a physical vibration.\n\nHis \"iCane\" is being tested by US visual scientists at Florida State University, and is expected to go on sale soon.\n\nThe prototype looks like a small radio and is being developed for those who navigate independently but need to know specific words, such as street names.\n\nMr Ahluwalia, 24, of Chicago, has been blind since birth.\n\nThe device uses frequency-shifting technology to create audio signals that match frequencies Mr Ahluwalia has assigned to different colours.\n\nThe frequencies are stored in a small receiver worn in a pocket, and transmitted to earphones.\n\nHe said a computer program translates colour into sound in his mind.\n\n\"I hear the words as colour,\" he said. \"If I say a colour aloud - blue, black, white - I am now hearing that colour rather than imagining what it looks like,\" he explained.\n\nMr Ahulwaila, who is a graduate student at Florida State University, where the invention was developed, was inspired by an incident in 1998.\n\n\"I was crossing the street one day and couldn't hear traffic coming from behind me,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I started thinking about frequencies, and then I thought, 'What if I can convert words into different frequencies?' \"\n\nAt the time, he had never heard of Braille.\n\n\"How am I going to learn words on this thing?\" he recalled.\n\nHe was introduced to Braille, and took it a step further by converting Braille into Braille-to-audio technology that would allow him, as well as others without the use of sight, to interpret the dots by sound, and in turn translate the dots into any language.\n\nMr Ahluwalia said the biggest challenge with his invention was how to convert Braille and other written languages into sound.\n\n\"It took a lot of research.

    "\"When a tumor segment of the gastric-duodenal junction is fed back into the brain, it is not completely reprogrammed. The tumor segment does not die. Instead, it undergoes local degeneration, which is then re-enriched for its future use through pattern-based reinforcement. The result is that this tumor segment, which before underwent massive shrinkage and was in disrepair, is now reinvigorated and returns to healthy size. The current approach exploits the strength of reprogramming by leveraging partial segmentation. We design a model-free neural network architecture that fully maps on the structure of the neural network of the original tumor segment. We demonstrate the efficacy of the network at reconstructing the original tumor segment and re-releasing it to maintain the original morphology, while maintaining the local degeneration and tumor segment fusion. By using the network's reconstruction model, we are able to efficiently detect the original tumor segment and release it for later use.",
    "Hey everyone,\n\nI wasn't sure if I should post this or not but I believe there might be some wonderful folks out there who have been through the same and could share their wisdom. I am 34 weeks along and have been diagnosed with preeclampsia.\n\nInitially, I noticed swelling in my hands and face, but considered it to be normal pregnancy stuff.

    "\"Dawn of the Dead\", directed by George A. Romero, is a solid work of cinematic art that thrills, frightens, and provokes deep thought, keeping you on the edge of your seat for its entirety. It masterfully blends elements of horror, suspense, and social commentary into a gripping narrative that is as relevant today as it was at the time of its release in 1978.\n\nThe film's plot follows a group of survivors who take refuge in a suburban shopping mall against the backdrop of a society collapsing under the weight of a relentless zombie apocalypse. The premise may sound simple on paper, but it's the layered subtext, clever writing, and distinct characterizations that elevate the story beyond your average horror flick.\n\nRomero's thematic exploration of consumer culture through the lens of a zombie apocalypse is both biting and bold. By turning the mall - a symbol of consumerism - into both a sanctuary and a trap, Romero offers a critical look at American society's blind worship of consumption. The zombies, mindlessly wandering around the mall drawn by faint memories of their human lives, resemble the hollow satisfaction derived from materialism.\n\nBeyond its social commentary, \"Dawn of the Dead\" sure knows how to deliver a scare. The practical effects are astonishing, especially considering the time of the movie's release, offering grisly and graphic scenes of zombie violence that still cause shudders. The pacing of the film ensures that the suspense is not compromised, skillfully switching between adrenaline-pumping action and quieter moments of dread.\n\nThe performances by the lead actors are definitely worth mentioning. They bring authenticity to their characters, evoking sympathy and terror in equal measures. The dynamic between these characters adds another layer of tension and contributes to the overall dread that permeates the film.\n\nDespite its age, \"Dawn of the Dead\" remains a high-point in the horror genre and a potent spectacle of sociopolitical commentary. The film stands as a testament to Romero's knack for blending gruesome horror with thoughtful critique, making it a must-watch for genre enthusiasts and casual movie-goers alike. Although it may be brutal and bleak, there's a strange beauty in its nihilism that keeps you hooked till the very end.",
    "For the past months ever since March I was addicted to Sword Arts Online and it was my favorite anime of all time. A month ago when it ended at episode 26, I kept waiting till October to finish the second season and the waiting killed me and I started replaying episodes over and over again, but when it finally ended at episode 25 I still kept waiting and I felt lost and empty. I looked and searched everywhere for an answer to make me feel better but I found nothing.\nI understand that the whole theme was to show that people can actually survive in a VRMMORPG without dying and to enjoy their life in it. I agree with that. But why is it different with this one? Why is it different when other games like Gurren Lagann, or Fullmetal Alchemist or even One Piece or Naruto or any other one died at the end and they were all considered great? Is it because of that Sword Art Online was so good yet they didn't show what a new world like that without being controlled by an AI would look like, how people would cope after so many years that it made me feel lost?\nI know that the main point is that Kirito and Asuna became able to meet real people after all that time and they were the last ones to leave Aincrad, but then why does it feel empty? Why are they no longer in Aincrad? Why are they dead and gone? They were alive and they were happy for once. In a way they didn't live at all. They left what they wanted so badly to live in the real world but they lost all they had in the virtual world so then why did they leave? Aincrad was a living city. You could go to the town square and see everyone and talk with them, you never knew what they were going to say, there would be a festival or a carnival, they would go swimming. You knew where your house was and you could go there whenever you want. Every city had its own boss for each city, you could visit them and see how they lived. They had stores like McDonald's and Starbucks, they had their own anime movies, they were everything you couldn't have in the real world. Their own world was the perfect world without the real life problems, no diseases, no world war, no starvation, no terrorism, everyone would be",
    "\"Hot Fuzz\" is a piece of unencumbered British comedy gold that seamlessly blends action, humor, and a bit of whodunit into a thoroughly enjoyable and addictive cinematic treat. Directed by Edgar Wright, it is the second installment in his \"Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy\". \n\nSimon Pegg stars as Sergeant Nicholas Angel, a top London cop who has been 'promoted' to the seemingly quiet village of Sandford for simply exceeding his achievements beyond his colleagues'. Pegg's expression of true British grit tempered by bewildering confusion with his circumstances is pitch-perfect. Nick Frost, who plays the comically inept but good-hearted Danny Butterman, complements Pegg brilliantly. The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable and the rapport shared feels genuine and hearty.\n\nWhat makes \"Hot Fuzz\" stand out is how it brilliantly parodies the Hollywood cop-buddy genre films while never failing to maintain its British sensibilities. The dialogue is quick, witty, and filled with subtle humor that ensures even repeat viewings are rewarding. The references and one-liners are a delight to notice and appreciate.\n\nNetting a masterful and diverse ensemble cast which includes Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, and Bill Nighy, the performances inject additional life and eccentricity into the movie. Timothy Dalton, in particular, effortlessly brings charm and menace to his role, making it quite memorable.\n\nThe cinematography and editing are exceptionally slick for a comedy. Fight sequences are choreographed and shot with precision, effectively parodying and paying homage to action movies. It’s astonishing how perfectly Hot Fuzz matches the traits of the films that it derives inspiration from.\n\n\"Hot Fuzz\" also features one of the most explosive climaxes which elevates it from mere comedy to a ridiculously fun and action-packed romp. Although it's definitely laugh-out-loud funny, it never shies away from graphic violence, making it a bold and rewarding movie choice.\n\nWright’s signature comedic timing combined with Pegg and Frost's on-screen camaraderie, layered with the outstanding supporting performances, makes \"Hot Fuzz\" an absolute gem. Its clever script, sharp editing, and commendable acting across the board, truly makes it a must-watch. Watch it once for the laughs, watch it twice for the intricacies of the clever screenplay and keep watching it for the sheer pleasure of it.",
    "This academic paper explores the interplay between defects, the Super-Poincaré line bundle, and fermionic T-duality within string theory. The paper establishes connections by studying domain walls in N = (2, 2) supersymmetric sigma models. We investigate the behavior of open strings ending on the domain wall, providing a specific case study of Fermionic T-duality under this scope. This novel investigation elucidates how certain quantities transform under fermionic T-duality while broadening our understanding of anomalies and group cohomology in string theory. The discussion also highlights the potential effects of these phenomena on associated physical systems. Notably, the display of consistency between observed and theoretical transformations affirms the fidelity of these principles. This intricate interplay of defects, Super-Poincaré line bundle, and fermionic T-duality arouses a deeper understanding and prompts further research in this area.",
    "We propose a new approach for object recognition, where feature extraction is based on the sparse representation, but the dictionary elements are SDD. Our model is inspired by the observation, that certain classes of objects have well-defined contour in the image space. For example, car or bicycle shape can be described by relatively simple shape descriptor, whereas complex objects such as people or animals are harder to describe. We propose a framework, where the sparse codes for the individual contour patches are learnt and then the classification is performed by learning an appropriate linear combination of the sparsely represented features. Our framework is tested on three data sets: MIT-CMU object benchmark, SUN scene categorization and Caltech-101 scene data sets. We obtain improvements over the state-of-the-art for all of them using much simpler and computationally more efficient model. We also propose a novel method for learning of SDD elements online. We provide comparisons to related work, including object contour extraction, shape recognition and recent approaches to image classification based on sparse representation.\nRelated links from arxiv.org:\nhttp://www.arxiv.org/abs/1210.3845v1\nRelated links from Springer Link:\nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10115-012-0672-2#\nRelated links from IEEE:\nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6527772&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpl%2FarticleDetails.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6527772\n1.

    "\"Saving Private Ryan\" remains one of the most impactful and visceral cinematic experiences ever crafted. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film fuses an emotionally compelling narrative with harrowing war scenes, creating a cinematic masterpiece still unparalleled in the genre.\n\nThe film begins with an incredibly intense, gut-wrenching 25-minute sequence of the D-Day invasion on Omaha Beach. The viewer is immediately thrust into the gritty chaos of war, effectively capturing the confusion, intensity, fear, and courage of the soldiers. Spielberg brilliantly portrays the raw brutality of war, leaving viewers overwhelmed and deeply moved.\n\nAt the center of the movie stands the compelling story of Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), the last surviving brother of four, serving in the World War II. A group of men, led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is tasked with finding and bringing home Private Ryan. This seemingly simple premise is densely packed with exploration of themes such as courage, sacrifice, and the brutal effects of war on the human spirit.\n\nThe performances across the board are superlative. Tom Hanks delivers a remarkable, riveting performance that anchors the film. Matt Damon, as Private Ryan, gives a praiseworthy act that blends innocence, bravery, and anguish in equal measure. The supporting cast, which includes the likes of Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, and Vin Diesel, adds depth and richness to the film through their exceptional performances.\n\n\"Saving Private Ryan\" is carefully constructed, with Spielberg's effective storytelling being complemented by Janusz Kaminski's brilliant cinematography. The camera work is breathtaking and immersive, thrusting the viewer right into the heart of the action. The battle scenes are spectacularly disorienting and disturbingly realistic, highlighting the gruesome realities of World War II.\n\nThe film goes beyond the typical war narrative by focusing on the value of human life and the genuine struggle faced by soldiers. The exploration of such thoughtful themes is what sets \"Saving Private Ryan\" apart from other war films. It is as much about the inner psychological battles as it is about the physical war happening around them.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Saving Private Ryan\" is an absolute must-watch for anyone who appreciates powerfully told stories infused with memorable performances and breathtaking cinematography. Spielberg not only offers a gritty, in-your-face look at the horrors of war but also eloquently demonstrates the resilience of the human spirit amidst chaos and destruction. This film is both a cinematic spectacle and a profound study of humanity that will linger in your mind long after the credits roll.",
    "I've been delving into cryptocurrency and decentralized finance for a while now but I'm having trouble understanding a few concepts, one being LPs or Liquidity Providers, and the other being SecretSwap. \n\nFrom my understanding, LPs are users who fund a liquidity pool with an equivalent value of two tokens. They do this to facilitate trading on a platform and in return, they get fees from the trades that happen in their pool. However, I'm not clear on how exactly these fees are generated and how risk factors like impermanent loss come into play.  \n\nAnd then there's SecretSwap. I know it's a platform for swapping tokens but it seems much more complex than that. \n\nCan someone please dumb it down for me? What exactly is SecretSwap, how does it work and how does it differentiate itself from other swapping platforms? Also, how can one become a liquidity provider on this platform? What are the benefits and risks?\n\nAny insights or resources on this would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance for your help!",
    "# ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE TRANSMISSION THROUGH A SUBWAVELENGTH NANO-HOLE IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL PLASTONIC LAYER\n\n# Srinivasan Gopalakrishnan, Yonghua Du, and Zhijie Zhao\n\n# Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Kansas,\n# Box 9025, Lawrence, KS 66045\n\n# Abstract:\n\n# Abstract\n\n#\n\n# We have numerically simulated the transmission of an electromagnetic\n# wave across a one dimensional nano hole with a large hole to diameter\n# ratio. The nano hole is realized by a circular groove machined in a\n# two-dimensional plasmonic layer. One end of the layer is illuminated by a\n# Gaussian beam with a circular polarization. We have observed the\n# formation of a standing wave pattern due to interference between the wave\n# travelling across the groove and the leaky wave along the edge of the\n# groove. While analyzing the standing wave pattern we identify the regions\n# of transmission and diffraction of the incident beam. We note that the\n# standing wave pattern is completely asymmetric with respect to the\n# polarization of the incident beam. The asymmetric transmission of the\n# standing wave pattern is due to the anisotropic plasmonic properties of\n# the two-dimensional layer. The maximum transmission of the standing wave\n# pattern is noted for a circular polarization of incident beam. The\n# dependence of the transmission of the standing wave pattern on the\n# polarization of the incident beam is quantified using the ellipticity of\n# the transmitted beam. Our analysis shows that the ellipticity of the\n# transmitted beam is in the range - to 6 x 10-6.\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nAn electromagnetic wave propagating inside a host medium is known to\nundergo reflection, refraction and scattering at any interface between the\nmedium of interest and the surrounding medium.

    "\"The Aviator\" serves as an incredible examination of the enigmatic figure, Howard Hughes. Directed by master craftsman Martin Scorsese, this film is defined by its brilliant storytelling, radical editing style and breathtaking cinematography, making it a visual masterpiece to behold. \n\nAt the heart of the movie, Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Hughes is nothing short of extraordinary. DiCaprio superbly personifies the magnate’s charm, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and paranoia, bringing a profound depth to the character. His performance perfectly captures the tortured genius who struggled with his internal demons while managing to revolutionize both the aviation and film industry. \n\nCate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn delivers an impeccable performance, buying into her role with disproportionate gusto. A special mention goes to John C. Reilly and Alec Baldwin who make their mark despite their limited screen time. \n\nThe story magnificently illustrates Hughes's ambitious endeavors and his ruthless pursuit of perfection. The film’s recreation of the Hollywood Golden Age is so remarkable that the viewers are thrown back in time, submerged wholly in that glammed up era of glitz and glories.\n\nScorsese does an exceptional job at portraying the quieter, intimate moments as powerfully as the grandiose spectacle, notably the striking depiction of Hughes's struggle with mental illness. The film successfully intertwines the worlds of business, politics, cinema, and aviation, showing the interconnected mesh that it was. \n\nThe film scores high on its technical aspects. From breath-taking flying sequences to meticulously designed period sets and costumes, to Sandy Powell's impeccable attire and Robert Richardson's blinding cinematography - \"The Aviator\" is an aesthetic delight. \n\nDespite its length, viewers’ attention will remain firmly gripped by its compelling storyline and superb performances. Scorsese, with \"The Aviator\", has carved yet another cinematic milestone that particularly stands out in its biographical and historical accuracies. \n\nIn conclusion, \"The Aviator\" is a somber yet extraordinary tale that epitomizes human triumph over adversities, pain, and self-destruction while highlighting the power of dreams. One can watch it for the top-notch performances, excellent direction, beautiful cinematography, or the inspiring story itself. Either way, this cinematic jewel is worth your time, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.",
    "Asian banks are putting the brakes on the dollar's slide, after investors fled the currency amid fears the US economy is about to slide into recession.\n\"Asia's currency traders, the so-called locusts, are coming in,\" said one currency trader. \"This is classic support by Asian banks to stop the dollar going any lower.\" The Japanese yen moved up towards its three-month high against the dollar, trading 0.8% higher at 111.66 yen.\nThe pound also gained ground, up 0.2% at $1.5534, while the euro slipped against the US dollar and the yen, as European finance ministers looked to hammer out a bail-out plan for the eurozone. However, the yen's gain came as Japanese investors booked some profits.\nThey have seen the yen surge 25% against the dollar so far this year after the US Federal Reserve announced \"stimulative\" measures and the Bank of Japan said it would boost its asset purchases. The Bank of Japan's decision to increase its bond purchases was one of several factors pushing the yen up.\nSo in this article, the Bank of Japan is said to be \"pushing up\" the yen and \"booking profits\". What?\nThis article is about US currency traders getting fleeced by Asian currency traders. But since it was not a matter of who was selling and who was buying, but simply where the sell orders were originating from, one might wonder about the choice of the terms \"pushing\" as in \"pushing up the yen\" and \"booking profits\".\nWhen the traders who want to see the yen \"down\", i.e. selling into the falling market, are US traders \"pushing down\" the yen, and the traders who want to see the yen \"up\", i.e. shorting the yen to profit when prices continue to fall, come from Asia and \"book profit\" from the long side, one is led to the impression that the authors of this article are not familiar with how trade flows through the markets. This is not surprising given the fact that the article was penned by people who are not traders.\nNow, as to the actual yen/dollar trade flow, the yen is being \"pushed up\" against the dollar, and Asian investors are not \"booking\" profit",
    "I just asked my boyfriend if he thinks it's weird that i get so excited and \"clingy\" when he messages to ask me if i'm ok, if i have a place to stay, etc...\nWhen i first met him, we spent days talking on whatsapp and messaging while playing games. We used to have a lot of sleepover and the best times were when he came to my place and stayed overnight with me and we had fun chatting and cuddling ( we've officially been dating for almost a year and are 20) I honestly can't sleep until he replies to my message. I even tell him how much i love him when we sleep at my place. This also happens when he stays over at his mom's or sisters.\nHe says that's not a problem and i shouldn't get stressed about it, that it's just normal to check on each other. I also told him that sometimes when he doesn't message and doesn't message me back that i feel lonely and i get very worried about him. He says that's normal too.\nI don't understand why these are normal for him, but these feelings aren't normal for me. I feel like i just have it too much but i think the most worrying part for me is that i always seem to be the one who keeps asking and the one who keeps checking up on him. He's more laid back then me. I'm just so paranoid about him and I always feel like if i don't ask them my worries about them will cause them to be angry or upset. I don't really know what's wrong with me or if it's just me being overreacting here. I would really appreciate if anyone can advise me please.\nI'm going to keep it real here. Let me give you my honest opinion about your situation:\nThe truth is that there is nothing wrong with you. You are not being \"clingy\" or \"too much\". If you are having these feelings, it is because his actions are rubbing you the wrong way.\nIf you don't receive a message from him for a day and it causes you to feel lonely and depressed, I would say that's just a reflection of your own thoughts around the situation. It sounds like you are projecting your own feelings of loneliness and depression onto him because you are not receiving the reassurance you would like",

    "\"Rang De Basanti\" is a brilliantly crafted socio-political drama that is a must-watch for cinema enthusiasts worldwide. Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra skillfully merges contemporary India with its rich history, using six students as the linchpin for the narrative. The movie deftly portrays the transition of these carefree students into responsible individuals, galvanized into action by certain unforeseen circumstances.\n\nThe dexterity with which Mehra interweaves two different timelines is commendable, as is his adaptation of historical characters in a contemporary framework. The screenplay by Kamlesh Pandey is power-packed and emotional, leaving the audience hooked from beginning to end.\n\nThe ensemble cast featuring Aamir Khan, Siddharth, Kunal Kapoor, Sharman Joshi, Soha Ali Khan, and Atul Kulkarni, deliver power-packed performances. Aamir Khan stands out with one of the most memorable performances of his career. Not only do the characters feel real and relatable, but their transformation is also credible and thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nThe soundtrack by A.R Rahman serves as the backbone of the movie. His music resonates with the storyline and the emotions of the characters. Whether it's the rebellious \"Khalbali,” the patriotic \"Luka Chuppi,\" or the stirring \"Roobaroo,\" each track blends seamlessly into the narrative.\n\nThe cinematography is exceptional with India’s beauty captured in all its glory; it works in perfect harmony with the brilliant direction. The film also excels in other technical aspects including editing and production design.\n\n\"Rang De Basanti\" is not just a film but a notable commentary on Indian society, politics, and the youth's role in its progression. Interestingly, it also mirrors a sense of urgency and desire for change. It is an emotionally stirring, inspiring, and aesthetically pleasing cinematic experience that prompts introspection.\n\nAlthough set in India and dealing with distinct Indian issues, \"Rang De Basanti\" is a universal story that resonates with audiences globally. Its narrative is relevant for any society grappling with political and social issues. Undoubtedly, it remains one of the finest examples of Indian cinematic prowess and is well-deserving of all its acclaim.",
    "Tensions are escalating once again between the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) as a significant trade row over tariffs threatens to plunge the two entities into chaotic negotiations.\n\nThe issue stems from President Biden’s attempt to alleviate some of the tariff responsibilities placed on the EU by his predecessor, Donald Trump. The latter's administration had imposed heavy tariffs on EU products, notably steel and aluminum, inciting a long-standing dispute.\n\nEuropean Union representatives have expressed their willingness to negotiate, but have insisted on addressing existing US sanctions before any further developments are discussed. There is a notable insistence on the lifting of tariffs that were imposed under the 'Section 232' national security pretext by the former Trump administration. \n\nHowever, talks are proving fruitless thus far, as retaliatory tariffs from both sides remain in effect. The EU has hit back with equivalent penalties on US imports worth $7.5 billion. These cover a range of products including motorcycles, jeans, and bourbon whiskey, thus bringing a broad spectrum of industries into the fray.\n\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled in 2020 that the EU could impose tariffs on US goods, following a protracted legal disagreement over subsidies received by American aircraft manufacturer Boeing and European competitor Airbus.\n\nDespite the change in administration, the Biden government thus far has shown no signs of lifting levies on steel and aluminum imports from the EU, making matters more complicated.\n\nUS Trade Representative Katherine Tai, acknowledged the tension, stating, \"Our objective is to resolve this dispute and bring back a sense of stability and predictability in our relationships with our trade partners\". However, she also asserted the need to ensure that American employers and workers are not unfairly disadvantaged.\n\nWhile there is a visible attempt from both sides to find common ground and a mutually beneficial resolution, the complex backdrop of intertwined industries and billions of dollars at stake has created a quagmire of conflicting interests.\n\nThis ongoing trade tension between the US and EU threatens to undermine transatlantic relations and the global economy. It's in the clear interest of both parties to find a swift resolution to this dispute, but for now, the tariff chaos remains unresolved. \n\nEconomists are watching closely as this impasse has the potential to both disrupt markets globally and create a precedent for future international trade disputes. Yet, amid the turmoil, there remains a glimmer of hope that agreement can be reached, fostering stronger bonds of international cooperation and economic stability in a post-pandemic world.",
    "I live in Canada and decided to visit the United States this year to see whether animal rights activists would be as welcoming to me as they were to other vegans. I'm not sure whether or not the answer to this question is \"no\" — after all a great many vegans have traveled to the US and found it extremely challenging to meet and organize with actual vegans (a similar challenge exists in Canada, too, by the way). Nonetheless, many of these vegans I encountered were extremely welcoming and happy to give me advice or let me know how the Vegan world differs from the conventional world. But I never really saw veganism being discussed on any major American website besides the vegan subreddit. Is it because the internet is only as good as the information it provides?\n\nThe author also made some comments in the comments:\n\nSo I'm not sure. This was posted 2 years ago. It was linked to via facebook. Which means, it has about 1.5 million impressions on facebook. I don't know if it's got much publicity or not. It still appears that this subreddit is relatively new.\n\nI did a little digging in the comments too and it appears this was one of the first posts, made in a sub forum called \"Vegans in America\" (which contains some interesting links, including one from a site with a blog called \"Rivulut\"), and the link from facebook is a post from July 19th 2016.\n\nHowever, the subreddit itself (which could be more \"recent\") is a pretty popular one; it currently boasts 27,500 subscribers — much higher in numbers than the mainstream vegan site vegans.org, which currently has just over 5,000 subscribers. At the peak of \"Vegans in America's\" popularity, in the days before they were banned (because of harassment and hate speech against them), they were gaining about 500 subscribers per day (which was pretty close to the amount of people they could normally attract).\n\nSo it appears they have been pretty much destroyed by the ban and their users tend to be younger, and the majority female. Though the subreddit seems largely made up of people in their 20s and 30s (see other posts from me in this subreddit; there's one from 2 years ago, which was posted on 10/6/2016, for example), it seems it was also used by and",

    "There's a lot of interest in replacing your old RAM and I've heard a few times people having trouble finding RAM. With that in mind, I've made a list of possible alternatives to replacing RAM.\n1) Upgrade your CPU\nIt has been my suggestion more than once that upgrading your CPU is probably a better option than upgrading your RAM, or at least will give you a better overall experience. Here's the argument. Upgrading your CPU allows you to not only increase the overall speed of your system, but also, for the most part, increase your RAM limit as well. Upgrading your CPU is a great solution if you can afford it and have limited RAM options.\n2) Upgrade your hard drive\nUpgrading your hard drive is an excellent option especially if you still have the same CPU as you had three or four years ago. Even if you are a CPU wh0re, though, and are constantly upgrading like I do, you should consider upgrading your hard drive. You'll see performance increases and you'll also save money in the long run. Upgrading your hard drive is one of the best places to start when you're looking to increase the performance of your computer.\n3) Upgrade your graphics card\nThis could be a good option if you're planning to eventually upgrade your RAM. Upgrading your RAM can make a notable difference in your overall system performance, but you do have to be careful. A graphics card upgrade will only give you additional RAM if it comes with an additional DDR socket, and most modern graphics cards don't. However, if you plan on making this a long-term upgrade, or if you need some extra memory, this could be a good option.\n4) Upgrade your PC case\nThis is probably one of the easiest alternatives. Your PC case is the most important piece of hardware because it is what protects your computer from damage while it's not in use. But it can also be the least important piece because it's the piece that does the most damage to your system. Most people don't think of upgrading the PC case when upgrading their system, but it can make a huge difference in overall system performance. Upgrading your case gives you the ability to upgrade your motherboard as well as the ability to add more GPUs and RAM.\n5) Upgrade your",

    "In this, the third of the Harry Potter films, the Hogwarts' students are growing up fast, as Harry and Hermione are soon to find out.\nThe film's early scenes do a good job of explaining previous events through a series of flashbacks told at the Quidditch World Cup. But it isn't long before Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends are back to their usual shenanigans. Ron (Rupert Grint) shows a lack of commitment to the Gryffindor team (that he himself captains), leading to him being sacked as captain.\nRon's incompetence is compounded by a new arrival to the cast of Hogwarts characters, the dashing Harry's competition: Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) gets to play the part that Harry did in the first two films, of being the baddie.\nThis is the first film in which we hear that magical word Harry Potter dreads: Voldermort. Though Ron manages to bring the name up casually, the prospect of the boy with the scar on his forehead conjuring up dark magic still fills Harry with dread. Alas, his attempts at evasion and his refusal to use magic on his classmates seem to land him in trouble more than ever before.\nTo this end, Dobby the House Elf (Toby Jones) makes an impressive entrance in Harry's life, as he comes to help him in his time of need. A wonderfully tragic and comic character, he shows what an emotional connection with the audience the film has, even without the big name stars. Even Harry's old antagonist from the previous film, Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), has a much bigger presence.\nThe introduction of Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth (Richard Griffiths - and, yes, the brothers do look similar), proves that the magical world will be even harder to grasp than before.\nAs with all the Potter films so far, the child actors do a brilliant job - despite their lack of experience - of conjuring up a sense of fun and camaraderie.\nThe films are proving themselves to be more than just fun and frolics, and in many respects, they're becoming even more mature and intelligent - and a big part of that is down to the young actors",
    "\"The movie has been given many favorable notes by its critics, including the New York Times, Boston Globe, and Los Angeles Times. One of the things that makes this movie great is the screenplay by Mark Duplass and Jesse Peretz and directed by Thomas Vinterberg is a smart and witty examination of the issues that plague women in America. In a way it is as if the movie is saying that when it comes to women, it is better to be judged than condemned. The movie also has some great performances by Rachel McAdams, Kate Winslet, and Michelle Williams. The film is set in the 1970's where society has decided that the solution to the problems of the time is to give women the right to vote. Instead of having an issue with that, the women have organized the movement to have their voices heard at the voting booth and are now demanding equality from men. The key to the movie is being able to see behind all these women's eyes.\" Written by Anonymous",

    "A report claims that the number of gadget makers could fall from 50 in 2001 to just nine by 2005. The head of Research Intelligence, Dr Jim Nail, says: \"There are still over half a million people in the UK who are self-employed but only a few thousand people are actually making and selling their own gadgets. \"They want to work for themselves but they are not qualified to do it.\" According to Nail, this might spell trouble. \"The average job in the next three years will be 10 per cent safer than the average job today, but will see an additional 50,000 new jobs.\" He also claims that the current market for personal assistants is \"very strong\" according to a recent survey carried out by EHRL. It found that the average business expects an additional 50,000 people looking for work. But who these new workers will hire won't be known until the market opens in January. Dr Jim Nail believes that \"companies are going to have to adjust their thinking\" and \"take a long-term strategy.\" The Gartner Group is the leading market research organisation and it estimates that the smart personal assistant market is already worth £300 million. One expert, Dr Gary Llewellyn, from technology consultancy Bupa, agrees that people will want their own personal assistant in five years' time, and he says: \"That's going to mean they use your phone, your car or your TV.\" So far, only eight of those listed on the market are actually functioning devices. They include the Roomba, the Nest, the Epson Scan, the Walkman, the Dyson or the Echo, the Echo Dot, the T-shirt microphone, and a few others. The report also predicts the rise of the smart-TV as a mass market product that can control smart devices. It says that TV owners will take control of smart home devices on their TV by tapping on them and it will be easy to connect and control devices with a TV remote. It forecasts that over the next 20 years nearly 80 per cent of all media content will appear in a smart format. This is a prediction that is widely recognised and it is widely acknowledged that many TV channels will be in a smart format in the future. However, the report also predicts that television viewers will gradually shift away from conventional TVs with a TV-in-a-box and towards TV",
    "\"Spectre\" undoubtedly cements itself as a high-octane addition to the iconic James Bond franchise. As a die-hard Bond fan, this specific film impressed me with its meticulous homage to classic Bond elements, stylish visuals, and magnetic performances, while introducing compelling narrative twists to the mix. \n\nThe film's producers took every measure to ensure \"Spectre\" matched its predecessors' spectacle and grandeur. Thomas Newman's rousing score punctuates every scene impeccably, giving it an epic quality that is impossible to overlook. Meanwhile, Hoyte van Hoytema's outstanding cinematography is a visual treat, enamoring viewers with sweeping landscapes one moment and switching to ridiculously cool, high-impact action sequences the next. \n\nAs for the performances, Daniel Craig exudes charisma and grit as James Bond. He effectively displays Bond's sophisticated charm, quip-ready humor, and ruthless efficiency, continuing to evolve the iconic character in fascinating ways. Meanwhile, Christoph Waltz delivers a magnetic performance as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, adding depth to the villain’s persona with his nuanced acting.\n\nThe beautiful Lea Seydoux brings vibrancy and tenacity to her role, making a delightful addition to the list of Bond girls. Her chemistry with Craig is palpable and serves as a refreshing departure from some of the past superficial Bond girl portrayals.\n\nThe script also deserves a nod for its intriguing blend of old-school Bond elements with modern narrative sensibilities. \"Spectre\" boldly peels back layers of the character’s past, providing fresh context to his character arc, while also exploring the classic trope of a power-crazed villain with a personal connection to Bond.\n\nWhat slightly holds the film back, however, is a somewhat convoluted plot that occasionally indulges in unnecessary complications. Moreover, while Waltz’s Blofeld is fascinating, he is underutilized, making his character feel slightly shallow compared to past Bond villains.\n\nNevertheless, \"Spectre\" delivers what one expects from a Bond film - cool gadgets, incredible action sequences, exotic locations, stylish suits, and the incredible, irreplaceable charm of 007 himself. It might not redefine the franchise, but it definitely offers a thrilling addition to the Bond saga that caters to both modern audiences and hardcore Bond fans alike.",

    "> Many existing encoder-decoder networks for semantic image segmentation assume that a good decoding stage is provided by simply adopting a single stage from a top-performing pixel-wise classification network. However, the success of such simple architectures may be attributed to pixel-wise classification networks designed especially for decoding purposes. In this work, we make the observation that better decoding stage architectures with multiple stages can be learned by designing decoder-specific optimization tasks. \n> \n> We first propose the task of predicting pixel-level features from high level abstract images, which provides discriminative information in a highly efficient way. Then, we propose a multi-stage decoder for semantic image segmentation, where the goal is to reconstruct the image from a low-resolution feature map. Moreover, we present an efficient encoder model that can be easily scaled to obtain higher capacity. Our model and design principles can be applied to improve existing pixel-wise classification networks for segmentation.

    "This paper presents an exhaustive survey on the rapidly evolving field of image segmentation, with particular focus on bottom-up segmentation and semantic cosegmentation. It starts by reviewing traditional methods that segment based on local cues and then ventures into the realm of semantic segmentation that relies on high-level, meaningful features. This progression in the survey emphasizes the growing significance of semantic information in understanding and segmenting images. Encompassing both established and novel techniques, this work also investigates the intersection of these two approaches, particularly in the context of cosegmentation. In providing insights into the complex problem space of image segmentation and its sub-fields, this survey aims to serve as a comprehensive guide for researchers who wish to build upon existing developments in these domains.",
    "\"Passengers\" is a visually stunning, thought-provoking space adventure that challenges its audience with deep themes of isolation, survival, and ethical consequences. The celestial drama is skillfully directed by Morten Tyldum, under Eric Heisserer's stirring script.\n\nThe core plot revolves around Jim (Chris Pratt) and Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence), two civilians awakened 90 years too early from their induced hibernation on a colonization spaceship. Their palpable chemistry, backed by their impressive acting prowess, perfectly captures the anguish of two souls grappling with loneliness and a daunting future. \n\nPratt successfully delivers a heart-rending performance as the abandoned mechanic while Lawrence once again demonstrates her talent by portraying a multifaceted writer drawn into an unimaginable predicament. Their desperate longing for human company and consequential love story creates riveting drama aboard the ship.\n\nThe production design is a marvel to behold, with breathtaking space visuals and intricately detailed interiors of the spaceship counting as highlights of the film. The special effects are spectacular, particularly during the spacewalk and propulsion scenes. They amplify the daunting vastness and hostile beauty of outer space, making \"Passengers\" a captivating visual treat.\n\nThomas Newman's soaring score is another standout element. It perfectly complements the narrative’s tension and desperation, creating a perfect atmosphere for the moviegoers to immerse themselves.\n\nHowever, the film is not without its controversies. Some may find the plot's primary ethical dilemma disturbing and argue that it lacks depth in dealing with the morally complex situation it presents. Moreover, the ending may feel rushed to some, considering the film's massive build-up of suspense and exploration of existential despair. \n\nDespite these, \"Passengers\" is a compelling watch for fans of the sci-fi genre, living up to the promise of a visually enthralling space drama with charismatic leads. It serves up a unique blend of suspenseful survival story with a romantic angle, maintaining the audience’s attention from start to finish. Would recommend for viewers seeking a visually stunning cinematic journey, nuanced performances, and intrigue-packed storyline that will keep them pondering long after the credits roll.",

    "Celebrated Hollywood icon, Tom Hanks, was greeted to a wintry premiere night yesterday in Central London. Fans wrapped in layers of warm clothing lined the streets outside the cinema, waiting in anticipation for the arrival of their beloved actor.\n\nThe evening saw the first screening of Hanks' latest blockbuster, where he plays a war veteran fighting against climate change. The movie has already sparked considerable Oscars talk with its impressive storytelling and solid performances.\n\nAs the first traces of snow began to fall on the London streets, cheers erupted when a black car pulled up and out stepped Hanks. Wearing an elegant overcoat and a charismatic smile, the two-time Oscar winner joyously embraced the cold weather, underlining his reputation as a real man of the people.\n\nWith an open umbrella in his hands, Hanks took his time walking the red carpet, stopping regularly to interact with his loyal fans - shaking hands, signing autographs, or simply exchanging a few friendly words.\n\n\"There's something magical about a premiere in winter,\" Hanks told reporters, his warm breath visible in the crisp air, \"The cold somehow captures the excitement and anticipation of the event. And to see all these fans braving the weather just adds to it.\"\n\nSeveral of Hanks' co-stars also attended the premiere, each braving the cold, lending the night a glamorous yet oddly festive feel. Notably present was the movie's young sensation, Ava Thompson, who gave her first significant big-screen performance alongside Hanks.\n\nOver the course of the evening, Hanks used the chilly outdoor platform to discuss his thoughts on climate change - a central theme covered in the film. \"Just like in the movie,\" he said, \"we need to help each other and our planet - our only home, in real, tangible ways.\"\n\nDespite the freezing temperatures, the crowd outside the cinema remained in high spirits, showing their unwavering support for the much-adored actor and his new movie. With its successful premiere, the film is now set to open in cinemas nationwide next Friday.\n\nThe wintry premiere, although uncomfortable for many, made for an exciting and entirely memorable encounter with the star.

    "A novel context tree compression algorithm (CTC2) developed from CTC1 [1] is presented. As in CTC1, CTC2 employs a variable-length code table scheme for coding the leaves of the tree followed by a two-pass variable-length code table-based encoding algorithm of the non-leaf nodes. CTC2 is based on a new universal code structure with an extended set of rules that allow a universal coding structure with fewer code tables that reduces the peak memory requirement. Additionally, CTC2 uses the entropy model for binary source, which allows CTC2 to achieve a shorter code word size, and as a result provides more compact codes with improved compression efficiency. Finally, CTC2 addresses the computational complexity issue of CTC1 by introducing two new concepts, including the CTC2 encoding map and the CTC2 non-leaf node context tree encoding algorithm. The former is used for efficiently determining the node types (i.e., node depth, context tree and leaf table) and the latter for encoding the non-leaf nodes. The results show that CTC2 provides better compression rates with significantly lower peak memory and encoding (encoding map and context tree encoding) requirements compared to CTC1.",
    "Liverpool FC manager Rafael Benitez could not hide his delight after his side took a formidable step towards the Premier League title. The Reds secured a crucial victory against their top-four rivals to gain control of the league table.\n\nBenitez, leading his charges from the dugout, praised his players for their exceptional display of skill and perseverance on the pitch. Liverpool dominated possession and showcased a solid defence, curtailing the opposition’s attacking prowess. \n\n\"We showed real grit and determination today. The lads displayed immense character to grind out a result and it is this fighting spirit that makes me proud,\" an ecstatic Benitez said during his press conference. \n\nLiverpool started the game with a high intensity, hustling their opponents and taking an early lead. Benitez lauded his players’ game plan, which they executed to perfection on the pitch. The win gives Liverpool a significant advantage with only a few games left in the season.\n\n\"Credit goes to every player. Every single one of them fought like it was their last game. It was a team effort, even the players who didn't make it onto the pitch contributed enormously,” Benitez continued.\n\nFan favourite and Liverpool winger, Sadio Mane, was the star of the show, netting two goals, earning the Reds a crucial victory. Mane’s performance mirrored Benitez’s tactical awareness, with the Senegalese international making full use of every opportunity that came his way.\n\nWhile Benitez was jubilant over the win, he ensured to remind his squad that the Premier League title race is far from over. \"The season doesn’t end today. There are more games and more points at stake. We still have a long way to go and we need to maintain our focus,” he emphasised.\n\nThe Reds' victory marks a decisive shift in the league, forcing their closest rivals to play catch-up. Can Liverpool maintain this form for the remainder of the season? Only time will tell. One thing is for sure, under Benitez’s watchful eye, Liverpool is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThis monumental victory has not only put Liverpool in a commanding position but has also marked one of the most defining moments of Benitez’s managerial career. There seems to be much more in store for this team. It’s safe to say that joyous scenes at Anfield might become a familiar sight this season.",
    "Abstract\n\nFeature based fuzzy rule based image filter generation is a promising approach for detecting object and motion artifacts. In this paper we present a general framework for designing and implementing such rules at the pixel level. This framework is based on the idea that features can be identified and extracted from pixel data using an \"image segmentation\" strategy, a technique proposed in the recent work of Gao and his coworkers at Microsoft Research. In order to extract features from image data, our framework enables us to leverage recent advances in machine learning and data science like deep networks, neural networks, gradient descent, etc. on the problem of detecting features, e.g. pixels or objects. The concept of a fuzzy model for features is simple, the idea is to classify a feature class as either a number (e.g. an \"object\" or a \"feature\") or an integer, say a \"min\" or a \"max\". The features are then classified as \"fuzzier\" and higher fuzzy classification score is indicative of higher accuracy. The image segmentation of features is an interesting problem since it can be solved by building a feature feature space and applying any desired non-linear decision rule. This article presents a general framework for such image segmentation approach, i.e. the implementation of a fuzzy algorithm for detecting \"classes\" of features in a given image. Our approach to segment features based on a fuzzy classification algorithm is based on the concept of a \"feature space\" with its input as feature classes and its output as fuzzy classification test, a feature vector (see Figure 1). The feature vector is generated by a simple linear least squares fit of the training features over the image (i.e. the input) and the output vector is obtained by applying (i.e. the output of) the \"Feature Fuzzy Rule Base\" for the given image using the \"Feature Fuzzy Rule\" feature classifier. The general framework we describe is able to handle a range of features. Some special cases of image feature \"classes\" can be handled by a separate code, while features that are relevant for the overall image segmentation are handled by the same algorithm. The algorithm we describe has been implemented within FuzzyFuzz. In addition to the algorithms in FuzzyFuzz, we have also implemented features detection using the \"feature-space\"",
    "If Ed Wood were alive today to see Tim Burton's biographical film \"Ed Wood\" he would surely tell you that the film is his best yet. Ed's film career was marked by some of the worst films ever to grace a movie screen. His career as a director included such masterpieces as \"Glen or Glenda\", \"Bride of the Atom\", \"Bride of the Monster\", and his masterpiece and last film, \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" a science fiction film of such epic and ludicrous proportions that it has attained a cult following and has become a \"must see\" for any fan of \"so bad it's good\" movies. The story of Ed Wood is a strange and wonderful one. An individual who believed he was destined for fame and fortune but, instead, ended up making some of the worst movies ever made. There's no denying that he was the ultimate \"also ran\" but that does not mean that this film should not be seen. Quite simply that could not be further from the truth. Ed Wood as a director is a genius by all standards of the word. While I do not mean to say you will be entertained I do mean to say you will be impressed. A movie that's filled to the brim with some of the most creative moments ever put to celluloid. The acting alone in \"Ed Wood\" is what makes the movie such a worthwhile viewing experience.\nJohnny Depp gives a performance that ranks up there with his role as Willy Wonka. The over-the-top manner of dressing and acting as if he was born and raised in the 50's (this movie takes place during that time) is something I never tire of watching. Martin Landau delivers a career-best performance as Bela Lugosi. His portrayal of this aging movie legend is so well done, it feels like you are actually watching the man himself and Landau is able to capture all of Lugosi's mannerisms and tics. Bill Murray and Jeffery Jones give very solid performances as well. However, it is the three main women in the film that steal the show. Sarah Jessica Parker as Ed Wood's wife is the one woman who would put up with all of Ed Wood's craziness (with the exception of Orin Johnson played by Vincent D'Onofrio). Patricia Arquette as Ed Wood's mother has probably the toughest",
    "Directed by George Lucas, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (1996) told the story of Anakin Skywalker from his birth in 34 BBY up to his death at the hands of Darth Vader in 19 BBY. The film was a massive hit at the box office and proved to be quite lucrative with a worldwide gross of $400 million. The film has been re-released in select theaters after the original release and, for the first time, was released on DVD. George Lucas has made several changes to the film in between its initial release and its reissue in 1995, including an alteration of the ending where Vader killed Anakin on Geonosis. Lucas has even gone as far as to claim that he wrote the final ending himself. While he might be justified in claiming all these things, Lucas has stated that he did not change the film after it was completed and only began editing it as it became a more serious picture rather than just a simple campy action film.\n\nIt looks like this is a remake of the 1999 Revenge of the Sith trailer.

    "This research paper investigates the traveling wave solutions for a bistable equation that is combined with non-local diffusion. Non-local diffusion refers to the phenomena where changes at one location directly influence changes at remote locations. A key focus is the non-local diffusion acting as a dispersion term for enhancing the connection with bistable dynamics. Mathematical modeling, existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behavior analyses of waves are performed. The wave speed or propagation is found to be essentially influenced by the non-locality strength in the bistable equation. Findings will provide insight into varied scientific fields such as biology, ecology, epidemiology, and physical sciences where models can exhibit bistability and travelling waves combined with non-local effects.",
    "\"Climax\" is not just a film; it is an experience - a particularly wild, and arduously chaotic one, designed to push viewers out of their comfort zone, and it does a terrific job at it. \n\nDirected by Gaspar Noé, known for his provocative style, \"Climax\" perfectly synthesizes the elements of dance, fear, and freedom into a surreal nightmare. Noé has pushed the envelope yet again, experimenting with unconventional storytelling that leaves viewers grappling with their own interpretations. \n\nThe film is set entirely in a remote school building, where a dance troupe celebration descends into madness after their sangria gets spiked with LSD. The choreography is breathtaking; the uncut dance sequences that open the film are an absolute visual treat. They elicit feelings of euphoria, capturing dancing’s transformative power before spiralling into mayhem.\n\nThe relentless techno soundtrack pulsates throughout, effectively accentuating the movie's manic intensity. The cinematography deserves a special mention as the disorienting camera movements and kaleidoscopic lights contribute heavily to the film's dizzying aura. \n\nThe casting and their performances are stellar. Sofia Boutella gives a particularly power-packed performance as the troupe leader, seamlessly transitioning from cool control to frantic horror. The ensemble cast, mostly played by actual dancers, adds a layer of authenticity to the film.\n\nDespite its brilliance, \"Climax\" certainly isn’t for everyone. It lives up to Noé's reputation of offering extreme cinematic experiences that can be deeply unsettling. Some scenes are profoundly disturbing, and the characters' descent into hallucinatory madness can feel exhausting to watch. This film makes a point to unhinge, affront and refuse to apologize throughout its runtime. \n\nIn essence, \"Climax\" is contemporary dance meets absolute chaos. It is visceral, outlandish, and disturbing. It's a film that continues to linger in one's mind, perceptible as both a mesmerizing spectacle of dance and a disturbing exploration of human nature and collective hysteria. It is one of those films that you may love or hate, but surely won't miss its mark.",
    "(a)\n\n\nMIMO radar allows detection of non-coherent localizations of a range of acoustic signals. It has already been used with many objects and has been used with various animals. In this study, we compare the capabilities of MIMO radar for localizing on a moving object in one of the following three cases: in a noisy environment, in a dense noise environment, and in a noisy environment where an object is in a localized, but noisy, pattern. We define these three cases as the noncluttered, the noisy and the cluttered cases. We compared the capabilities of the MIMO radar on the noncluttered case and its counterpart (a single-shot) and on the noisy case. These were used to determine the range at which the radar could be used on noncluttered and noisy cases, respectively.\n\n\nWe have demonstrated in this paper that MIMO radar allows detection of the noise patterns in a cluttering environment, but not the noise in a noncluttered environment. In order to detect localizations for noncluttered animals, the range at which the MIMO radar can be used is significantly lower than for cluttering animals and very close to the limit of its range for the noisy environment. The range is further limited by the high error that this technique makes in detecting the cluttering pattern.\n\n(b)\n\n\nWe have demonstrated in this paper that MIMO radar is effective at detecting the noncluttered animals, but not cluttering animals.

The range for MIMO radar when using a single shot is comparable to the range the MIMO radar can be used to localize animals in a cluttering environment.\n\nThe key to the success lies in the fact that MIMO operates in a high frequency band, making it possible to detect the clumping and to be able to achieve high accuracy, while still using only a small amount of power.

    "Celtic demonstrated their dominance in a comprehensive 5-0 defeat of Clyde at Broadwood Stadium on Sunday, maintaining their position as the leading force in Scottish football.\n\nThe encounter saw Celtic demonstrate a lethal mix of precision, pace, and power, overwhelming Clyde's defensive line from the very start. Neil Lennon's team never appeared threatened, scoring two goals in the first half and adding three more in the second with the assurance of a side comfortable in their attacking prowess.\n\nWinger James Forrest opened the scoring for Celtic in the 20th minute, before striker Odsonne Edouard doubled their lead with a spectacular shot in the 38th minute. The second half saw Celtic's attacking midfielder Tom Rogic net the third goal with a patented left-foot strike in the 68th minute, while Leigh Griffiths and Callum McGregor notched the final two goals in quick succession towards the end of the game.\n\nClyde put up a defiant stand in the early stages of the match, but as the game stretched out, they seemed unable to withstand the relentless pressure from Celtic. Their midfielders struggled to disrupt Celtic’s rhythm, while their defence found it increasingly difficult to contain the swift movement and interplay of Lennon's men.\n\nThe visitors' display was a stark reminder of the gulf in class between the two sides. Celtic, through this victory, reinforced their status at the summit of the Scottish Premiership.\n\nSome may argue that Clyde did not offer the sternest of challenges. However, Celtic will be satisfied at accomplishing another comprehensive victory while demonstrating both attacking fluidity and defensive solidity.\n\nClyde will undoubtedly look to bounce back from this defeat and turn their focus to their next tie. However, the critical analysis and introspection will need to be profound if they intend to arrest this slide.\n\nThe victory propels Celtic a step closer to their goal of securing another domestic title while laying a marker for other teams in the league. Celtic’s performance under Lennon's leadership has been nothing short of impressive – a fact further underlined with Sunday's result.\n\nHowever, it is also worth mentioning the excellent support of the Celtic faithful, who travelled in numbers to back their team, contributing massively to the atmosphere at Broadwood Stadium. Despite a cold winter afternoon, their relentless cheering was rewarded with a superb display of attacking football from their team.\n",
    "Highly accurate pixel-aligned image super-resolution (SR) is desired in many practical applications and is extremely challenging since it essentially requires estimating the high spatial frequency components. The underlying reason is that SR aims at recovering a high resolution (HR) image from a low-pass (LP) representation of it. The missing frequency information is the key source that makes the LR image look blurred and the HR image blurry. Intuitively there is a tradeoff between the image sharpness and its blur. In the literature the sharpness is quantified by various regularizers which measure differences between adjacent pixels. However, it is not yet clear how to quantitatively and accurately quantify the image blur or how to relate it to the desired image sharpness. To bridge this gap we construct a blur quantifier based on the LP model of the image and develop a theoretical framework to study the relationships between the blur metric, the proposed image sharpness and other regularizers. We also apply the proposed method in the context of deep learning to train a deep SR network. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods.\n\nThis abstract from a paper discussing how to increase the resolution of images uses a complex metaphor to help explain an equally complex technical concept.\n\nFrom your earlier analysis and synthesis of the text, what are you able to determine about how this will help?\n\n# **6.4 METADATA**\n\nThe metadata is what goes on behind the scenes. How do you make sure you're not infringing on others' artwork? Do you get permission from the artist? It really depends what type of work you're planning to reproduce. But you'll need to obtain permission from the artist if you're reproducing his or her artwork _in whole_ or _in part_ on a t-shirt, or on any other product. You can't simply do a Google search for an image that's public domain unless you know that the copyright has expired. You also can't claim that an image in the public domain is your creation. And if you think you can make a profit from someone else's art, then you can't use it without the artist's permission. You need to know what you can and cannot use as an image for your new t-shirt design.\n\nThe easiest way to find out",
    "Glastonbury festival revellers to get ID cards as part of'safer festival' plans\n\nGlastonbury's'rehabilitated' area can be seen by people, but they can still get fined £200 if they get in the way of others, a BBC Radio 4 documentary has found.\n\nA spokesman for Worthy Farm has said the festival has been re-organised to allow more people in, after a string of trouble-makers damaged the historic site in 2013.\n\nThat includes breaking through police lines on a stage. The man, who is said to be in his early 20s, told the BBC he had no regrets about pushing through police lines when he felt the stage was about to be blocked by a police barrier.\n\n\"I just didn't want to get stuck in the mud,\" he said.\n\nThe BBC's Steve Wright interviewed six security guards who had attended to the incident in the lead-up to the festival. We were told at the time that this was the first time they had been in charge of security at Glastonbury for four years.\n\nThey told Steve Wright they had been asked to clear the area out so that people could get to the festival's entrance.\n\n\"After the first year or so the police got increasingly hostile towards the people attending Glastonbury the police felt it necessary to move the boundary lines and the law was changed to allow people to be in the park longer,\" one of the security guards told Steve Wright.\n\nThis was explained as a way to deal with people who had damaged property in the past.\n\nAlthough the BBC were trying to keep the details of this incident a secret from the public to prevent further clashes, in the event, a policeman was sent to the location to inform the police of what had occurred to prevent further trouble.\n\nThe BBC spoke to a woman who was there when it happened. \"I saw people actually walking around in the middle of the road, smashing windows and stealing,\" she said.\n\nAfter a lot of pushing and shoving with a police squad car they eventually had to break in and force everyone out of the field. This resulted in the protesters being arrested and detained until the authorities could take action.\n\nIt was unclear at the time but this story from September 2016 suggested that police, instead of being the ones to push people out",

    "Hey everyone, \n\nI apologize in advance if this post becomes a ramble. My mind is a whirlwind right now and I'm desperate for some clarity or advice. I don't know who to reach out to or where to begin, so I thought I'd start here.\n\nFor the past few months, life has been increasingly difficult. Every day I find it harder to get up in the morning, to put a smile on my face, to convince myself that everything's alright. I struggle to even eat or sleep properly. Things which used to excite and motivate me no longer hold any interest or appeal. I feel like I'm stuck in a perpetual state of sadness and it's suffocating me.\n\nIt has started to affect my relationships, my work, my studies - every aspect of my life. People around me have begun noticing my change in mood and behavior but I can't bring myself to tell them about these feelings. It's difficult to explain - hell, I barely understand it myself. It feels like I'm trapped in a dark room with no doors or windows, and I can't escape.\n\nI've tried self-help books, guided meditation, online resources, but nothing seems to be working. \n\nI'm making this post mainly out of desperation. I don't know what to do or how to cope with this. Maybe some of you have been through the same situation and can share advice or resources that worked for you. Maybe some of you are professionals who can guide me toward potential treatment. I'm open to anything at the moment.\n\nLastly, I do want to clarify that I'm not currently a danger to myself or others - I know that's a common concern with these kinds of posts. I just really need help figuring out what these feelings could mean, and how I can start to feel better.\n\nThank you in advance for any guidance you can provide. I appreciate it more than you know.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the support I've received. I can't express how comforting it is to know that I'm not alone and that help is available. I will seek out professional help soon.",

From my observations, he seems to be \"attentive, patient, and kind, though he is extremely naive and easily embarrassed by his ignorance\". As a result, his posts are usually incredibly lame, but there are a few highlights, which I will highlight briefly:\n\nI found his full name was \"kimiou\". For those that are not familiar, the term \"kimiou\" is a Japanese term for the first syllable of \"Korea\" with the second syllable being \"ou\".\n\nHis full name is \"Kimiou Kimiou\".\n\nThere is a reference to his family in the caption of one of his images.\n\nHe posts a picture that apparently shows his genitals (although it is hard to read from far away).\n\nIn response to a girl asking how she can be more attractive, he said she should \"practice getting out of her pants, which is a good way to show that you actually enjoy it\" and added \"and that's a secret that no one else knows.\"\n\nHe has a girlfriend and her name is Tae, he calls her Taejae, but it is hard to read who is being addressed and so I have left it off this list.

    "This paper presents a comprehensive study of a radiative transfer model for contaminated rough slabs. The model is designed to accurately simulate the effects of contaminants on the radiative properties of rough slab surfaces, an aspect often overlooked in conventional models. Its formulation includes a novel approach to managing the multiple-scattering problem, combining Monte Carlo and discrete ordinate methods. The influence of contamination and roughness is investigated for various materials and conditions, with results indicating significant deviations from traditional models. The proposed model thus provides a more realistic representation of radiative transfer in contaminated rough slabs and expands our understanding of how contamination and surface roughness interact with radiative processes.",

    "\"We propose a method to automatically measure the uncertainty of contour in delineating a prostate contour from the consensus contour based on a barcode representation of contour. This research can potentially be extended to other modalities as it is based on the mathematical representation of a shape. This method relies on the barcode algorithm that efficiently retrieves contour-based information. The information is then evaluated to obtain a score that represents the percentage of uncertainty. Experimental results show that this method can detect small shifts or incorrect contour insertions or deletions. The evaluation based on the proposed technique was performed using two categories of contours: the average contours from 3D-CT or MRI images based on expert and trainee delineations and contours generated by a fully automated segmentation algorithm. We demonstrate that a low percentage of uncertainty is present in the consensus contours, representing a low percentage of disagreement between the experts' and trainees' contour delineations.

    "In this dream, I was wandering in a city that felt strangely familiar, yet eerie, as I've never been to it in my waking life. The buildings were an odd mix of old and new architectural styles. It was raining too; the kind of rain you can see but not feel. I remember walking through the streets aimlessly until I found a small antique shop.\n\nI stepped inside and the shop was filled with objects of all kinds; books, sculptures, paintings, jewelry. The old man at the counter was engrossed in a book and didn't seem to take notice of me at all. I roamed around the shop till a particular ornate mirror caught my attention. I felt an inexplicable compulsion to touch it. \n\nThen, an unusual thing happened. As I touched the mirror, it was like I was pulled through it. Suddenly, I was in a lush meadow filled with flowers of every color imaginable and a clear blue sky overhead. The transition was so natural that it didn't feel odd or scary at all despite the surreal experience. \n\nI wandered this colorful landscape for an indeterminate amount of time. Unnaturally calm, I felt like I belonged to this place. Then, as suddenly as I had been transported there, I was back in the shop, standing in front of the mirror. The old man at the counter finally looked up at me and smiled.\n\n\"The mirror shows you the path, not the destination,\" he muttered, before I woke up. This line has stayed with me ever since, but I can't figure out what it could possibly mean. \n\nI remember this dream in vivid detail even though it's been a month, and it’s the only dream I can remember. It felt important, significant somehow. Anyone out there with insights into dream interpretation, could you assist me in understanding this dream? I’m really curious about what it might mean.\n",

This installment also introduces several plot twists that challenge our previous conceptions of the Star Wars universe, successfully bringing freshness to the long-standing franchise. The Last Jedi delves deeper into the characters’ emotions and motivations, making their decisions feel impactful and purposeful.\n\nThe performances are excellent across the board. Mark Hamill delivers the best performance of his career as Luke Skywalker, blending bitterness, fear, heroism, and humor in a portrayal that adds depth to the legendary character. Daisy Ridley's Rey continues to grow stronger and more complex, proving once again that she is a worthy successor to the legacy of Luke Skywalker. Adam Driver gives a riveting portrayal of the tormented Kylo Ren, a character we both despise and empathize with. The supporting cast, including the late Carrie Fisher, are exceptional as well.\n\nVisually, the movie is stunning. The action sequences are also expertly choreographed and filmed, making for thrilling, edge-of-your-seat moments. The art direction and use of CGI are commendable, expertly maintaining the grandeur of previous Star Wars films, while also introducing groundbreaking and breathtaking visuals. The Last Jedi is truly a spectacle for the eyes.\n\nJohn Williams' score does not disappoint. His iconic music uplifts every scene, adding intensity and emotional weight to the film. Williams’ legendary themes play a crucial role in the film’s nostalgia and grandeur, and his new compositions aid in creating an even more epic atmosphere.\n\nAlthough the movie is not flawless - there are a few instances where the pacing feels a bit too slow or subplots seem unnecessary - these minor concerns are overshadowed by the film’s overall excellence.

    "The paper \"Deep Superpixel Cut for Unsupervised Image Segmentation\" proposes a new method for image segmentation that harnesses the power of deep learning. Superpixels, defined as a group of pixels with similar attributes, are used as the primary unit of segmentation, producing a more accurate depiction of the target object compared to per-pixel methods. The novelty of the research lies in the introduction of a 'deep cut', a cluster of superpixels created using superpixel-level features generated through a deep learning model. An unsupervised approach is adopted, which enables the process to be free from the need for annotated ground truth for training. Experiments conducted during the research demonstrate a significant improvement in image segmentation accuracy in comparison to other current unsupervised techniques. The research, therefore, introduces an innovative approach that can largely enhance the performance of image segmentation tasks.",
    "#### Bolt is Awesome!!\n\n **Reviewed by jonnydrums-1 November 17, 2008**\n\n_Bolt_ is an awesome movie! It is rated G. It has the voices of John Travolta and Melanie Griffith. Bolt is a dog and Penny is a girl. I like it because Bolt thinks he's super. He thinks he has superpowers but he is just a dog that thinks he is super. Bolt thinks he can see the world like superman but he can not. Bolt is a white dog with lightning shaped marks. He has eyes in his back so he can see behind him. Penny is a red haired girl. She is really cute. Penny has a hamster named Rhino that she gets mad about easily.\n\nBolt thinks he is super because he watches TV all the time and he never leaves the place he lives. The other dogs in his living room think he is a legend. He thinks he's super when really he's just a dog. Bolt makes you feel kind of funny. You watch Bolt and say, \"How can a dog think he's super?\" The director is Byron Howard but the thing I like is the dog's voice. When Bolt yells \"I'm super\" he sounds like John Travolta. Bolt is not a good dog at the ending but he learns his lesson.\n\n_Bolt_ teaches children about responsibility. It also teaches that you need a good mom and a dad.\n\n_Bolt_ is a good movie. When you watch _Bolt_ you will have a good time. If you have seen the movie _Bolt_, you will have watched it before. It is pretty cool.\n\n#  A New Kind of Friendship\n\nAlthough the Internet is a great way to share information and get our needs met, it can also be dangerous.

    "Deep Learning for Drug Discovery Using Statistical Analysis: A Critical Review\n\nThe most successful drug discovery has relied on a multidisciplinary approach, i.e., combining large number of experiments to identify the causal factors which influence the efficacy and toxicity of drugs in human patients. In the case of drugs for cardiovascular disease, the main contributors to drug efficacy include factors related to vascular system, oxidative stress, neurotransmitters, inflammation, microenvironment or other pathophysiological processes. Thus drugs with a broad therapeutic scope with low side effects would tend to make great discoveries. However, the current state of knowledge strongly suggests that this strategy of drug discovery will not be able to find all the potential new drugs with important biological similarities. Instead of focusing only on drugs with a broad therapeutic scope, the most promising drugs in both preclinical and clinical trials are predicted to display a multidisciplinary approach, which includes factors related to vascular system, oxidative stress, neurotransmitters, inflammation, microenvironment or other pathophysiological processes.\n\nThe focus is on a critical review of recent studies published in the field of drug discovery. The focus is on the method to identify the nuclei of the cells for the purpose of deep learning based drug development. The authors propose the development of statistical tools to identify, isolate and analyze cells for the purpose of identifying the genetic bases for the observed patterns. Further they propose the development of the tools to identify differentially expressed genes, also called epigenetics, for the purpose of identifying drug biomarkers.\n\nThe method of deep learning based drug discovery is particularly appealing in the quest of developing effective new drugs. The development of such methods are based on deep neural networks (dNNs), which were introduced with the paper \"Deep Learning of Diverse Topics on ImageNet\" by the authors and it uses supervised learning algorithms to train such networks. It is clear that deep learning has not been enough when it comes to drug discovery, however recent studies indicate that the methods of deep learning have significant potential for drug discovery. The use of statistical analysis is also crucial for drug discovery. By analyzing the data as it comes in, the authors have identified a small number of drugs which they claim are able to be developed based on statistical analysis alone and this method seems to be a great way to identify new drugs. This method is used in real-life applications often",
    "In \"Taken 2,\" Liam Neeson returns as the relentless Bryan Mills, showcasing his impressive array of lethal skills and unwavering determination. Although admittedly heavily reliant on the success of its predecessor, this sequel manages to provide significant action sequences and nail-biting suspense that fans of the first film will appreciate.\n\nLiam Neeson delivers a robust performance, convincingly portraying a man who will stop at nothing to protect his family. He is as fearless and proficient as ever, cementing his on-screen presence as a credible action hero. Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen also return to reprise their roles, providing fair performances despite the limited character development in the script.\n\nSet in picturesque Istanbul, the cinematography is laudably vivid, contrasting the city's historical beauty against its increasingly dangerous landscape, effectively serving the narrative. The action sequences are thrillingly choreographed, albeit with a hint of predictability, but they certainly do not disappoint.\n\nWhat \"Taken 2\" lacks in originality, it compensates for with its adrenaline-pumping car chases, riveting fight scenes, and the overarching, commendable father-daughter relationship. This sequel strives to extend the riveting narrative of the original, an effort that should be admired despite its shortcomings.\n\nHowever, like many sequels, \"Taken 2\" struggles to capture the novelty and raw excitement of the first installment. Still, it functions effectively as a continuation of Bryan Mills' story. Moreover, the plot does, at places, feel a tad farfetched and repetitive, significantly drawing from the first film’s scenario.\n\nIn conclusion, audiences who look forward to indulging in an undemanding display of action and suspense will find \"Taken 2\" to be an entertaining experience. However, those seeking intricate plot advancements or new narrative twists might find it slightly underwhelming. Despite this, credit is due to Liam Neeson, whose compelling performance adds a layer of credibility and suspense to an otherwise predictable storyline.\n",

    "\"The 13th Warrior\" is a spectacular film that transports viewers back to a time of ancient civilizations, complete with seeresses, Norsemen, and warriors. Based on Michael Crichton's novel, \"Eaters of the Dead\", the film masterfully portrays the mysterious and fearful world that existed in the 10th century.\n\nAntonio Banderas delivers a memorable performance as Ahmad Ibn Fadlan, an Arab man finding himself in the foreign world of Norsemen. His transformation from a diplomat to a warrior is compelling, weaving an engaging narrative. The supporting cast members similarly portray their roles excellently, enhancing the film's believability. \n\nThe movie excels in its striking visuals, with breathtaking landscapes and elaborate costumes that effectively capture the era. Directed by John McTiernan, the action sequences are staged with an appropriate intensity that never fails to grip the viewer. With enough suspense and bloodshed, \"The 13th Warrior\" effectively keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nThe score by Jerry Goldsmith complements the movie's atmosphere tremendously. It creates a sense of dark foreboding and heightens the tension in the action scenes. As for the plot, even though it starts a bit slow, the mystery surrounding the Wendol and their identity keeps the viewers intrigued till the end. \n\nThe film explores themes such as bravery, honor, and camaraderie in an engaging way. While \"The 13th Warrior\" may not be a perfectly accurate historical representation, it offers a visually exciting and engaging story that keeps with the spirit of the historical fiction genre.\n\nSome may argue that the film falls into the trap of clichéd characters or predictable storylines. However, the way it packs history, legend, suspense, and action into a single film while drawing the viewer into its rich world certainly makes it worth a watch. \n\nThough \"The 13th Warrior\" may not be everyone's cup of tea considering its gritty, dark and sometimes violent nature, those looking for a riveting journey through a world of ancient lore brought to life might find it immensely enjoyable. This certainly qualifies as a purely entertaining cinematic ride.",
    "The Ministry of Justice has released new guidelines on how homeowners can defend themselves against burglars, following an increase in residential burglaries across the UK.\n\nThe new recommendations underscore that homeowners have a legal right to protect themselves, including using reasonable force, if they are fearful for their safety during a burglary. This amendment to existing guidelines intends to further clarify the law regarding self-defence in the home, offering reassurance to homeowners amid a rising spate of home invasions. \n\nHowever, the guidelines stipulate that “reasonable force” should not include actions which could be categorised as “grossly disproportionate.” While this term remains somewhat interpretive, the Ministry of Justice advises homeowners to consider the situation’s severity before deciding to use defensive force.\n\nThe Justice Secretary expressed hopes that the revised guidelines would bring clarity, saying, “No one should live in fear in their own homes. These guidelines aim to empower homeowners, enabling them to manifest their right to safety and security within their homes confidently.”\n\nA significant emphasis has been laid on preventive measures, including installing approved alarm systems and motion sensor lighting, among other home security methods. Homeowners are also urged to report all incidents of break-ins or attempted burglaries to the police promptly.\n\nThese guidelines follow other recent efforts by the government to combat rising burglary rates, including conducting nationwide safety awareness campaigns and providing additional funds for local police forces to increase surveillance.\n\nVictims’ support groups have largely hailed the guidelines, seeing its issuance as an essential step in addressing growing anxiety around burglary. However, some legal experts have expressed concern that the term “reasonable force” remains open to interpretation.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice has advised that further clarification on what constitutes 'reasonable force' will be provided with real-life examples via their website and additional resources. With these guidelines, the aim is to offer assurance to homeowners that the legal system is designed to protect the victims of crime, not those who carry them out.\n\nThe guidelines come into effect immediately and will be widely distributed to all households and local police departments across the country.",
    "It's been a week since I tried to log into my Instagram account, only to encounter a strange situation. After entering my details, the app suddenly prompted me to enter my mobile number for verification. Though surprised, I complied and entered my correct phone number. Instead of sending me a confirmation code as most apps would, Instagram threw me a curveball saying my account will be under review for 24 hours. \n\nWhat piques my curiosity is the absence of a security code sent to my mobile number. However, more worrying is the elongated review time of 24 hours, even after seven days there is neither an update nor access to my own account, making it clear it was a hollow promise. \n\nI've attempted to reach out to Instagram's customer support but, unfortunately, I'm met with deafening silence on their end as well. \n\nHas anyone else faced a similar issue? And if so, how did you resolve it? I would greatly appreciate any help from this community in retrieving my account. Cheers!",

    "I'm a current freshman. I decided to stay on my mother's insurance. I have pretty good insurance (although not completely the best on the marketplace). It's $270 a month for my policy alone. My mom was just diagnosed with cancer. I'm already struggling to afford the policy and I only make about $1000/month from my job, which doesn't cover my food and general living expenses. I only want to go to school because I want to get good grades and then get a job. I can't afford to go to school for four years. I know some financial aid is due soon but I'm scared that my insurance will cost me my financial aid and I was wondering if there is any financial aid I can get for my insurance. I'm trying to apply for the FAFSA but I have to have my taxes done first and I don't have them yet. Any suggestions or help are greatly appreciated. Any tips for next year to make this easier? (No I'm not asking anyone for money) Also, what can I say on the FAFSA to make sure something is taken care of for my insurance?\n\nIn another thread titled \"$13,000/yr medical needs based off income,\" someone commented, \"i'm really surprised no one has replied, you would think lots of people can relate.\" To which the original poster replied,\n\nYeah, I know. I was a little too scared to even comment there! I was wondering if maybe some people aren't familiar with the income based rates.\n\nMany of these individuals could have gotten financial aid to help pay for college, but they didn't qualify for help because of their income.\n\nThe College Board, an organization that supports students and families as they navigate the college experience, reported that, in 2013, 30 percent of college students received federal Pell Grants and, between 2008 and 2013, 2.1 million families filed appeals to the federal formula.\n\nIt's not at all unusual to hear of students not receiving the amount of financial aid they expected and needing to make up the difference from their own families or friends. This can be very painful for some families, especially when there isn't enough extra money.\n\nOne student from Iowa wrote about the experience of coming home after an initial disbursement of financial aid money during her freshman year and finding that she had",
    "It's not just me, there is at least one other teacher in my high school who is getting a lot of negative feedback about the subject. She is very bright and really has good things to say about how the course was set up, but she's also been noticing that when a student takes some tests, a lot of them don't study thoroughly. I can see she's doing her best to make students stay focused on everything that is going on in the class, but the problems just seem to come up when the student is trying to make their own progress.\n\nTo try to better understand what she's getting at, I read through her post. She's got a great way of looking at problems and how they are going to impact students, and that's also a thing I've struggled in trying to get myself to think about: Focus, Focus, Focus. Students' lives are all about things other than the learning task. I feel that's the wrong model to use for students, and has been the reason I've struggled in the past when trying to teach Math. You should focus on getting students to understand how the problem of the problem will impact everyone, rather than focusing on some parts of the students, like they're your own best friends.\n\nWhen I was in high school (around the start of the '98 grade) I took a lot of Math class, I was really passionate about the subject. I was reading up all day, reading blogs, and following math social media, and the more I read the more it all struck me as completely ridiculous to me. I was a huge nerd, but I wasn't just a huge nerd, my entire life revolved around math for any number of reasons, and it was never the reason to do something, and in the end it just hurt me when it was completely out of proportion to the actual value of the class. The one that really struck me though was that Math, as an entire subject was just a big waste of time. Why couldn't you tell me that when we were in class and I wasn't even aware that math was anything other than a class, I would be able to see that the entire course of life could be boiled down to getting something from A to B, and it should have been so obvious.\n\nIt hasn't totally gotten easier since then, the biggest problem",
    "Hi all,\n\nLast night, for the first time ever, I decided to bleach clean my bathroom. I mixed bleach with some water and went about cleaning. While I did not have any immediate reactions, I woke up this morning with red, itchy patches on my skin, specifically on my arms and hands. Not too sure whether it was because I used the bleach or if it's just a coincidence. \n\nFor context, I did wear gloves while cleaning but I didn’t wear long sleeves. So, I'm guessing it could be splash back on my arms and even on my hands from when I took off the gloves. I have washed my skin several times with mild soap and I've also applied some anti-itch cream, but so far, there's little improvement. \n\nI'm also feeling a bit paranoid now about having inhaled a lot of the fumes, because I realize I didn't ventilate the bathroom as well as I should have. I'm not really experiencing any symptoms in that regard, but I can't help but feel anxious about potential harm that I've done to my lungs. \n\nSo, I have two questions: \n\n1. Has anyone experienced skin irritation from bleach? If yes, how long did it last and what did you use to treat it?\n2. Should I be worried about potential inhalation of bleach fumes?\n\nThis is the first time I've had such an experience, so any advice or guidance would be appreciated. Also, any bleach handling safety tips for the future would be incredibly helpful.\n\nThanks in advance!",
    "\"Aramaic and Hebrew/Hebrew are two branches of Semitic languages; however, the two remain quite distinct from each other. The current paper aims at providing new insights into the construction of parallel passages in Aramaic and Hebrew. Through its novel methodology of examining word-order correlations, the paper is able to show that Aramaic and Hebrew contain an entirely unique set of syntactic and morphological relationships. The data show that the main areas of similarity are parallelism in word order as well as the construction of a number of words in a very similar way. In all of the above data, Semitic in-group shares all the features which are found in all languages. By contrast, some features are common to both groups, and the paper uses comparative data on the language families of various languages to explain these shared and unique features. The findings of the paper indicate that the Semitic in-group cannot be classified into one of four language families. This finding shows how our current understanding of the structure of the world cannot be based solely on the classification of the families of modern languages. As such, we look to the construction and use of word-order patterns through analogy with other existing linguistic patterns as well as future semantic and syntactic patterns through the use of new linguistic techniques.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(via Linguistic Archive's Ancient Records of Aramaic and Hebrew and Language Log)",

    "\"What is it that we hate so intensely in this film? Is it the sadism, the bestiality, the necrophilia, the ritual humiliation and mutilation of the bodies of two hundred young women or, perhaps, the endless perversions committed on them, both mentally and physically? Is it the moral degradation? Or maybe it is just the banality of it all. This is it: all that was done to those girls is just routine in our society. It is not the cruelty of the Nazis that's the most shocking - although the scene of mass rape by those soldiers, including the one (played by Giancarlo Giannini) that claims to be an art critic, certainly is one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen on film - but the utter indifference of the soldiers and the citizens of the town towards the pain, suffering and humiliation of other human beings. This indifference is what shocks us. It is the kind of casual sadism that we see every day around us, in society: it is not even the soldiers who take a more active part in the sadistic acts, but the policemen, the lawyers, the men of the town that only join for a bit, for a few minutes, while it is more interesting. \"\n\"The most difficult thing for most people to understand is that the film is not so much a celebration of sadism, but an invitation to think about the pervasiveness of sadism in our society, which is, as with fascism, a form of the politics of indifference, indifference which is not so much a lack of feeling as a refusal to acknowledge feelings, which are, as with the people portrayed in Salo, regarded as irrelevant, unnecessary and, ultimately the only thing that mattered in life, power.\"\nAnd from the San Francisco Bay Guardian review by Peter Hartlaub:\n\"Even though \"Salo\" was banned in Italy for a few years after its 1975 release, its images are as fresh in memory as yesterday's newspapers. At the same time, the film itself has been largely out of circulation, a victim of its own notoriety: no mainstream video distributor would touch it, even by accident. It is the true nature of the horror genre that many people have seen \"Salo\" without ever actually watching the film. People might be surprised to discover that this is",

    "This paper presents Flood-Filling Networks (FFNs), a novel methodological approach to dissect large-scale 3D neural datasets into individual neurons. FFNs are used to segment a whole human brain by applying them to high-resolution images of neural cells. We suggest that FFNs tackle the challenge of densely segmenting 3D volumes where traditional 2D detection and recognition techniques fall short. It involves a recurrent process that leverages a spatially-unbounded flood-fill operation to adjust incorrect neuron splits and incorrect mergers. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms other neural segmentation techniques in the ISBI 2013 SNEMI3D and the focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy volumetric images. This new technology has potential far-reaching implications for neuroscience, particularly in comprehensively mapping neuron connections at a microscale.",

    "\"One of the most stunning works of cinema ever is Steven Spielberg's \"Eyes Wide Shut,\" released on Christmas Day, 1999. The film is a visual tour de force, a film of beauty and grace. It's also, of course, the story of a sexual relationship between two lovers. Spielberg directs \"Eyes Wide Shut\" like a virtuoso violinist: with an ease and confidence that belies the material. He also plays with the conventions of the relationship movie: there's the typical sex scene (on screen and off); then comes the awkward one-on-one scene; then one has dinner together. (It's so romantic!) The movie is all about power, the use of it, the fear of it and its limits. The characters don't want to do what it demands, which ultimately drives us toward understanding, a humanist resolution. There are other movies about love that are more interesting, but \"Eyes Wide Shut\" is also about lust, and \"lust,\" a subject that is fraught with responsibility.\n\nFor this reviewer, the most powerful component is that the characters are women without the sexual innocence of the man that they share their most intimate moments with – and when not in an erotic relationship, this is about who they are at their most tender: mothers, sisters, daughters. All of them have to find a way to move on from their past experiences, with some success: the mother with her daughter, the sister and sister-in-law and the mother-in-law's daughter, and the sister with her husband. But the mother is an example of how not to handle this subject, since we see the mother try to talk some sense into her granddaughter:\n\nShe didn't really know that her granddaughter was growing into a woman: she'd never been able to understand all of the conflicting feelings inside her. That was what she did know. The girl was the girl, and it was only human, she figured, that she should be loved.\n\nIf she could have, the mother would have. She would have loved her daughter's lover; she would have accepted him as her companion (and her sister and brother; their bodies should be inseparable).

    "Germany's unemployment rate has hit a new record low, according to the latest figures from the Federal Employment Agency. The jobless rate has now fallen to 4.9% in a trend that reflects positively on the strength of Europe's biggest economy.\n\nAnalysts had previously predicted this figure, but the milestone endorses Germany's economic stability amid global economic uncertainties, demonstrating potential resilience in the face of international headwinds.\n\nApproximately 2.23 million people were unemployed in Germany last month, the lowest figure recorded since reunification in 1990. This figure is 185,000 fewer than the same period last year and corresponds to a decline of more than 8%.\n\nThe report also highlighted an increase in job vacancies, with around 798,000 open positions reported in April, approximately 6,000 more than during the previous month and 32,000 more than the same period the previous year.\n\n\"The German labour market continues to develop robustly,\" said Detlef Scheele, the head of the Federal Employment Agency. \"Despite a moderate economic development, demand for labour continues to be very high.\"\n\nEconomists assert that Germany´s robust labour market, backed by strong domestic demand, could provide a buffer against potential negative external impacts. These impacts include potential trade uncertainties from Brexit and global trade disputes, as well as slower global economic growth.\n\nAlthough the economy contracted in the third quarter of 2019 and narrowly avoided a recession by posting zero growth in the fourth, Germany’s labour market remained resilient. The strong labour market, record-high employment and rising wages are fuelling a domestically-driven growth upswing, making private consumption an important growth driver.\n\nHowever, despite such a robust labour market, many businesses in the country have reported facing a shortage of skilled workers. The Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry warned last year that the lack of skilled workers could become an increasing problem for Europe's largest economy and could potentially limit its future growth.\n\nIn a tight labour market, economists usually expect wages to rise, fuelling inflation and eventually prompting the European Central Bank (ECB) to hike interest rates. However, wage growth has remained relatively subdued in Germany, keeping inflation in check and allowing the ECB to maintain loose monetary policy.",
    "This is one of many biographical films made about famous sport figures. Some good examples are \"Raging Bull\", \"Jerry Maguire\" \"Million Dollar Baby\" and even \"Rocky.\". This is the life tale of boxer Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter. The movie is very well presented showing his life, how he met his wife and became a famous boxer at the same time. He is a contender for a World Championship title and it seems he has everything going for him until the day he is arrested and thrown into jail for a murder he didn't commit. He languishes in prison for years, losing his chance at the title, as well as his respect and relationship with his wife and children. It would take many years for him to prove his innocence and prove that the law enforcement was wrong.Many know the true story of \"Hurricane\" Carter. I have to say that this is one of those films that are hard to see but has to be shown anyway. It is the best performance Denzel has given and I can easily understand why he won an Oscar for his role. I think Denzel is deserving of an Oscar for this performance although many don't think so. It is also a powerful drama that is worth seeing. Denzel did a great job portraying a wrongfully accused individual without letting the audience feel any sympathy. He plays his role as a victim very well. His acting was truly outstanding and I can understand why everyone was talking about how much he deserved an Oscar.The supporting cast is very good. Forest Whitaker does an especially good job as his attorney. Famke Janssen, who plays his wife, gives an especially good performance. She is given a very emotional role and at times even tears up when she sees him in the position he is in. She is a sympathetic and warm person and it is a shame that they couldn't be together. Ingrid Munch, who plays his daughter, gives a very strong performance as a victim of her own mistakes. The supporting cast is very strong and each of them have their moments in this film.The movie is a true tribute to wrongfully accused individuals. I think this movie is especially relevant today as we see the growing awareness of those who are wrongfully charged and have their lives ruined by the state. \"Hurricane\" Carter has become a well known person and this",
    "\"Guardians of the Galaxy\" is a visually stunning ride into Marvel's cosmic universe that combines humor, action, and heart in spades. The visuals are of course breathtaking - a testament to the creativity that went into designing the various alien worlds and species. The CGI is glorious, with each alien world and creature flawlessly woven into the narrative. The special effects team deserves accolades for their excellent work, creating believable and fantastic galaxies that extend beyond our known universe.\n\nThe movie boasts a likeable ensemble of characters who together make up the crime-fighting/planet-saving team - The Guardians of the Galaxy. Chris Pratt shines as Star-Lord, with Zoe Saldana playing Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax, and the voices of Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper bringing life to Groot and Rocket Racoon respectively. What sets the film apart is the chemistry among these diverse characters, which allows for equal parts camaraderie and conflict.\n\nThe storyline, on the other hand, is not astoundingly original but is executed in such a fun manner that it isn’t a drawback. There's a tremendous amount of humor and wit in the script. The constant banter between the characters is both creative and hilarious. The humor doesn't just come from glib one-liners, but also visual gags and character-centric humor. \n\nMoreover, Director James Gunn deserves praise for striking the right balance between action, comedy, and emotional content. The action sequences are well staged and exciting, often containing clever bits of character development. However, Gunn never loses sight of the film's emotional core, which gives the characters a surprising amount of depth for a big, loud, action-packed blockbuster. \n\nNot forget to mention, the soundtrack is exceptional. From “Hooked on a Feeling” to “Cherry Bomb”, every song is perfectly matched to its scene, heightening the emotions while never overwhelming the action or dialogue.\n\nOverall, \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" is a perfect blend of action, humor, and heart, with an excellent cast, mind-blowing visuals, a brilliantly chosen soundtrack, which makes it one of Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most engaging and entertaining movies. It’s a thrilling, warm, and humorous adventure that leaves viewers eagerly anticipating the next installment.",
    "\"Get Out\" is a refreshingly poignant and thought-provoking horror film that uses its unique premise to subvert expectations and stimulate discussions about contemporary society. The narrative cleverly infuses relevant racial issues in America, providing a breathtaking blend of chilling suspense, uncomfortable humor, and potent societal commentary. \n\nThe central performance from Daniel Kaluuya is absolutely riveting. His nuanced portrayal of the vulnerable yet observant Chris Washington keeps you invested and empathetic throughout. The dread he expresses simply through his eyes in several scenes is beyond phenomenal. The supporting cast, especially Allison Williams and Catherine Keener, deliver equally impressive performances that contribute to the unsettling atmosphere.\n\nThe movie is directed with an assured hand by first-time director Jordan Peele, who was previously known for his comedic work. However, his transition into a more dramatic and serious narrative is seamless. Peele demonstrates a firm grasp of suspense and delivers an authentic sense of paranoia through innovative cinematography and commanding storytelling.\n\nOne of the most acclaimed elements of \"Get Out” is its script. The writing is power-packed with symbolism and subtle details, rewarding those who pay careful attention. The social commentary woven into the narrative is hard-hitting and important, never feeling forced or out of place. It reflects the uncomfortable truths of society, urging viewers to confront and reconsider their perspectives.\n\nDespite being the source of discomfort and quite disturbing at times, the film has an undeniable dark humor that provides occasional relief, yet without detracting from its eerie ambiance. The character of Rod, played by Lil Rel Howery, in particular, garners genuine comical sparks with his quirky personality and timed humor.\n\nReleased in 2017, \"Get Out\" has since become a cultural phenomenon, a well-crafted horror film that transcends genre boundaries. It’s a chilling narrative that’s both entertaining and undeniably thought-provoking. It will make you look at horror films, and perhaps even the world, in a whole new light. This movie re-defines what being a \"social thriller\" truly means, serving as a wake-up call to its genre and society alike.",
    "Hi. I'm 13 years old. My dad and I split our time equally. He works a full-time job that pays him in the high 40s, and me in the high 20s. I spend some nights off with him and I spend the others at his house. I want to do my homework by myself, and I want to be paid for my work. This is where my father comes in. When I said I want to work, he thought I was messing with him, but I told him that I work a full-time job and, if I wanted to get a full-time job later on in life, I'm going to have to work while at my dad's house.\n\nWhen he found out I wanted to work, he said \"Okay, I'll let you do your homework at my house\". I agreed, but only if he let me do it in his room, with his own computer to study on. I wanted to learn how things work, so I asked how much money it would take to buy things like books, school supplies, or computers, and to see if it would take them a full week to get the supplies for me. He says $30 a week. Here's the stuff he's bought for me: • Two laptops (I love my Macbook Pro), and two iPads • iPad, computer, and printer, I got the iPad 2 when it came out. • A textbook • Smart-Shoe charger ($3.99) • Headphones (they're great, but we have a big family of four, and my dad can't wear them). The headphones don't block out the sound of my TV/computer/tablet/phones and I can hear my mom and my uncle all too well as you can see in the pictures. I got them over a year ago - it's been a couple years since my first year at high school, and I'm not ready for them to be worn out.\n\nI was very clear before signing up, that if I wanted to work, I was going to have to work. Also, while it would make me money, I was thinking about whether or not I still wanted to go to high school. I have a high opinion of my dad and I can talk to him about that, but it hasn't made it into my plans yet.",
    "This paper presents an investigation into large-scale image segmentation using distributed clustering algorithms. It explores how distributed computing frameworks can be utilized to process high-dimensional imaging data effectively by applying improved clustering algorithms, such as K-means and DBSCAN. Simulations are performed using real-world data sets to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms in segmenting large-scale images. The results demonstrate the potential advantages of integrating distributed computing techniques and advanced clustering algorithms in terms of computational speed, scalability, and accuracy. Furthermore, the robustness of these improved algorithms is examined in dealing with various challenges of large-scale image segmentation such as high dimensionality and noise. The findings of this study provide insight into potential improvements for current image processing techniques and suggest future research directions.",
    "A couple weeks ago, one of the most vocal autism forums in the world, Reddit's /r/autism, had its domain name stolen and was not renewed by the registrar. This was met with a great deal of criticism from autistic people and allies in general, given the frequent attacks on disability rights and autistic voices on site, and because I was one of the few voices on the site who was not transgender, white, or cisgender.\n\nMy post read \"I am not transgender, white, or cisgender. The community that I live in, I am autistic.\" I wanted those who expressed anger at this to know that, while the community has always made room for me in its meetings and events and venues, they have never erased me.\n\nThe fact that I was autistic made me feel that this type of attack, which is the norm today to an incredible degree, would be more accepted in my community.\n\nWhen I posted that post, I was informed by the mods that they would be discussing how the community should deal with this unfortunate incident and whether it will be able to move forward. In a way, it was necessary.\n\nAfter the discussion on the post had finished, an autistic moderator called me a \"cisphobic transphobe who uses social justice jargon.\"\n\nBut the most terrifying and insulting part of the discussion was when the moderator who had called me a \"cisphobic transphobe\" asked why I couldn't have just said \"I'm autistic, so all those issues will just go away\" in the first place?\n\nBut not true. I believe it is our responsibilities as autistic people, as people with autism, as people who are part of the larger autism community, to speak out when our rights to exist and to speak out are violated. Autism is a disability. It shouldn't be a stigma.\n\nSo I believe it is our responsibility to speak out when our rights to exist and to speak out are violated, even if \"transphobic\" isn't the word that makes us uncomfortable or angers us.\n\nThe discussion itself was very interesting, and after a few more posts the moderator called me a \"transphobic transphobe who uses social justice jargon\" yet again. I decided that since I was so insulted by his comments, I would respond.\n\nOn Wednesday",

    "Contrastive learning (CL) is a promising approach to unsupervised representation learning, which is recently extended to the medical imaging field. CL attempts to embed the input data without labels to a semantic space so that instances of the same class are closer and those from different classes are farther. However, there are two challenges that limit the performance of CL on medical images with limited annotations. (1) Limited annotations hinder the clustering of training images into large groups to learn global features for representation learning. (2) Different body organs have their unique image features, rendering the limited images from different organs unbalanced.\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose to use local features to learn global ones for better representation learning. Specifically, we cluster training images into small but balanced groups (i.e., clusters) and train a local CL (LCL) model for each cluster to learn its local features. During training, all the LCL models are combined into a global CL (GCL) model, which learns a global representation for input images by contrasting the representations from different clusters. To improve the segmentation performance, we explore a simple cross cluster contrastive learning framework which can adaptively learn the image representations between each cluster and all the other clusters during inference.\nIn addition, a simple but effective data augmentation technique is adopted to augment images for CL with limited annotations. The technique is based on morphological dilation and erosion operations that can generate the pseudo labels of augmented images. The proposed approach is evaluated on two popular medical image segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is competitive to the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning models on both tasks.\n\n\nIntroduction\nRecently, deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved tremendous successes for medical image segmentation [1,2,3,4,5]. However, most of which require a lot of densely-sampled annotations for model training. This is expensive to obtain and a major bottleneck of applying deep learning methods to medical imaging analysis. To address this issue, there is a growing body of methods to learn medical image representations unsupervisedly from large-scale medical data. Some of which learn from only a few annotations [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14].\nInspired by the contrastive learning (CL) framework",

The paper describes how a small subset of the sparse subgraphs (in fact,\nthe very edges) can be used for non-negative rank selection by a special kind of\nregular network (known as \"multi-level graph (MGL) style (ML). \nBy applying an optimization technique known as \"cdf\" (concurrence distance ), the authors achieve\nan overall accuracy over 95% and performance on the LAPACK classification task (approximately 0.8\nperfer--an increase of over 10x over existing state of the art) that  is in excess of\nthe  maximum performance limit of the human classifier  for this problem.

    "> The idea of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling is to use more costly data to enhance information learned from cheaper data. Multi-fidelity models have recently attracted increasing attention, particularly in the areas of data mining and machine learning, in recent years. A general formulation of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling can be defined as learning a surrogate model from data collected from multiple distinct data sources. The data on which surrogate models are built usually depend on different aspects, e.g., data quality, data quantity, and/or data complexity. Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling has been successfully applied to a broad range of problems in many areas such as finance and engineering disciplines. Nevertheless, the success of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling relies on the understanding of the key challenges and research problems of building accurate and efficient multi-fidelity surrogate models.\n> \n> This article provides an overview of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling. We first introduce the background of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling. Then, we review some key issues in the construction of multi-fidelity surrogate models, including surrogate model structure, fidelity definition, and fidelity selection. Furthermore, we review multi-objective multi-fidelity surrogate modeling, multi-fidelity response surface modeling, and multi-fidelity global optimization. Finally, we identify some promising areas of research in multi-fidelity surrogate modeling by introducing some open problems of current work that should be solved in the future. We hope that researchers can identify some potential research problems and directions in multi-fidelity surrogate modeling from this review article.\n\n## [Learning multi-fidelity GP models for PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767)\n\nThe following is the full text of the abstract for a research paper titled \"Learning multi-fidelity GP models for PDEs\" from arxiv.org:\n\n> We consider learning multi-fidelity models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) where we have access to both high-fidelity (highly accurate but expensive-to-simulate) and low-fiutility (less accurate but cheap-to-simulate) model data. We consider models based on Gaussian processes (GP) and demonstrate numerically that multi-fidelity GP models are more accurate than models that use data from only the high- or the low-fidelity models",
    "\\begin{quote}\n  Recent progress in medical data science has relied on the availability of large annotated datasets. However, such datasets are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns and the labor required to annotate images manually, motivating research in self-supervised learning. One self-supervised learning strategy is data augmentation, in which different views of the same data are generated and treated as if they were different. One example of this is image contrastive learning, in which two slightly perturbed versions of an image are used to predict which one came first given their features. Despite the successes of contrastive learning, it cannot be applied in cases where raw data have not been collected or are not accessible. This motivates research in pseudo-data generation, in which a model learns to create synthetic images from random latent vectors, with those synthetic images acting as training data. A combination of both data augmentation and pseudo-data generation strategies has been shown to improve the robustness of the resulting model. While contrastive learning has been shown to work for natural images, there have been relatively few investigations of its performance on medical images. In this work, we present an end-to-end architecture for self-supervised training on medical image data from a private database that incorporates contrastive learning and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, we augment data by perturbing latent vectors associated with images, and use those to learn useful features before training a model for segmentation and detection. Experiments demonstrate the benefits of this approach, as the results of the proposed method beat the standard baseline, U-Net, as well as several other data-augmentation-only architectures on several segmentation and detection tasks.\n\\end{quote}\n\nThis abstract is an example of research in medical data science and the topic of self-supervised learning.

We use pre-training and self-training to improve performance.\n\n\\section{Experimental Setup}\n\\label{section:experimental_setup}\n\n\\subsection{Dataset}\nThe dataset that is used in this paper is a private dataset",

The complaint was filed before the site was taken off the Net by the French courts. The news site, which had been the source of much of Apple's information about its upcoming products before last week's reveal, is back on the Net, but Apple lawyers have sent the domain to Apple's US attorneys for possible seizure. \"I have taken steps to block future attempts at the site,\" said Jacques-Hervé Faucher, France's anti-piracy chief. \"I do not want this site to be a source in the future for the dissemination of information about Apple and its iPhones.\" The plaintiff in the Macisture case is the Dutch company Cazaux Systems, which owns www.materism-software.com, the site that published the leaked photographs of the iPhone-maker's phone.\n\nWhen Apple started this crusade, there was no such thing as a 'leaked' picture. When you have a photograph, you either have the camera rolling (when it's taking a picture) or you don't. You never 'leak' picture. If you take a picture with your camera, you have just taken it, while if you take a picture through the camera of a smart phone, this has just happened, and no picture has just been taken.

    "A \"hero's journey\" is often a journey to seek justice; here, it is to rescue a princess whom the kingdom has abandoned. When his father, King Ailfrost, is stricken with a deadly disease, he calls for a warrior chief. The young man, Balor (Luke Evans), agrees. Though Balor has a warrior's mind and a strong constitution, he is unprepared for the challenges in his new role.\n\nWhile battling his father's enemies, Balor has become embroiled in an underground war—to free the kingdom from a demonic plague before it is too late. The stakes are high, to say the least, for King Ailfrost and his kingdom.\n\nThis will be a hard road to navigate, as the story makes clear. We see this first-hand during the battle for the throne, which leads to the final film, \"The Last King of Scotland.\"\n\nWe know from both film clips and interviews that the lead actor in the film, Luke Evans, is a natural leader. The movie's trailer makes him look like a king, but at times, he is more of a \"lover\" than a king.\n\nHis first battle in \"The Last King of Scotland\" is the film's best scene. The trailer starts with him jumping from one horse to the next, attacking with a variety of weapons, both real and animated. He is in action mode from his very first moment. He has an interesting voice over that could well lead one to believe he might be a comic relief character by this point (perhaps that will work well in the trailer).\n\nThe two best battles he has in the book are on horseback, in which he is constantly outgunned. He also has several battles on foot in the book, but they often seem slower and more methodical as compared to the horse-based battle sequences in the movie.\n\nEvans' most interesting battle is where he uses only two weapons. One is a long wooden blade known as a \"sabre. With this weapon, he is able to take down a large variety of creatures including trolls and giants. Another weapon, commonly known as \"the spear,\" is thrown by him from the side. Here, it is used to pierce and damage the beast's hide.\n\nThis scene, in which Evans doesn't use any weapons other than his sword",

    "As an ardent cinema enthusiast, I delve into my reverie of \"Ghost\", released in 1990 and directed by Jerry Zucker. This romantic fantasy thriller, starring Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg, certainly does not fail to tug at its audience's hearts.\n\nThe enchanting plot revolves around Sam (Swayze) and Molly (Moore), who share an idyllic relationship that's cut short by a tragic incident, turning Sam into a spectral figure. His love for Molly leads him to persist in our world as a ghost. Swayze displays immaculate emotional authenticity in conveying his character’s post-mortal frustrations and yearnings. Moore's performance, however, undeniably stole the audience's breath with her compelling depiction of grief and love.\n\nArguably, the success of this movie is largely due to Whoopi Goldberg's character, Oda Mae Brown - a fraudulent psychic who, in a twist of fate, becomes Sam's liaison to the world of the living. Goldberg's Oscar-winning performance presents hilarious comic relief interspersed effectively within the film’s dramatic premise.\n\nArrayed with memorable scenes - the pottery scene being an epic in itself, the movie binds romance and supernatural elements seamlessly, while also delivering nail-biting suspense. The score, composed by Maurice Jarre, is deeply atmospheric, especially the haunting tune of \"Unchained Melody\", which adds layers to the narrative and elicits a soul-stirring ambience throughout the movie.\n\nHowever, the movie has its share of flaws. Some may find the portrayal of the afterlife and ghostly elements a bit clichéd and the film also occasionally meanders into the realm of over-sentimentality. Despite this, \"Ghost\" continues to be a beloved classic due to its moving depiction of eternal love and the lengths one is willing to go to protect their loved ones.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Ghost\" is a gripping tale filled with love, loss, and redemption. It is undeniably cheesy at times, but its earnestness and commitment to the love story at its core compels you to look past its few missteps. An absolute must-watch if you are a fan of love stories or fantasy films (or both). Don't miss out on this hauntingly beautiful tale of love transcending life itself!",

    "\"Kick-Ass\" certainly lives up to its title with a highly engaging, adrenaline-pumping, blend of quasi-realist and comic-book absurdity.

Mark Strong and Christopher Mintz-Plasse also deliver great performances, adding to the overall uniquely balanced and multifaceted tone of the film.\n\nDirector Matthew Vaughn has fashioned a surprise package tailored with innovative action sequences, witty dialogues, and an oddly charming plot that transforms a seemingly adolescent comic premise into a commentary on real-world violence and consequences. The fusion of gritty realism and eccentric comic-book violence are deftly handled, making the viewer oscillate between laughter, shock, and edge-of-the-seat excitement.\n\nThe movie's R-rating should not be taken lightly as it boasts a generous amount of profanity, graphic violence, and dark humor. It's definitively not a family-friendly superhero flick, and this serves to its advantage, allowing a level of creative freedom seldom seen in traditional masked vigilante narratives.\n\n\"Kick-Ass\" is a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre that cleverly subverts comic-book conventions, offering a raucously entertaining, action-packed experience that lives up to its audacious title.",

This model is derived from a deep understanding of information economics, applied to the current-day capital and production sectors. To make a coherent system, a system must have a robust design process and robust constraints on system performance; as a result, I introduce the idea of a \"System Credible Averaging\" (SCA) which can be understood as a system that can consistently trade at a low frequency relative to its value. The core principle of the ACE model is the concept of \"System Credible\": This principle has two key components that together give a coherent system strong constraints on system performance: The first is that it establishes strong constraints on the information that is communicated between different elements of the system; the second is that this information is tradeable in a fair or efficient way. My paper explains these concepts through the example of a financial system where the flow of information is so fragmented that an information asymmetric process is required to reliably allocate capital to a productive enterprise. Through this example, I highlight specific design challenges that are present in any systems for trading and capital allocation with regards to the design of the ACE. In addition, my model demonstrates the importance of being able to manage the \"cross-fertilizers\" that are inherent in the flow of information, which are necessary for any design process in order to efficiently use the cross-fertilizers. The ACE model has been applied to the allocation of the US corporate government debt and the current-day stock-market, and uses a method of \"quantum-qubit computation\" to demonstrate that a coherent Averaging System can trade at a low frequency relative to value.\n\nRead the whole thing.\n\nIn other words, it doesn't take too many sophisticated simulations to show how difficult it will be to make our financial system more efficient. The cost of using derivatives to hedge the derivatives is a good example -- what could be accomplished with a hedge program that took only milliseconds? If the economy really is a capital glut, then",
    "This academic paper delves into the concept of pattern avoidance within the realm of set partitions, a topic first introduced by Klazar. The paper expands the theory further and introduces new insights with a careful examination against Klazar's approach. Detailed proofs and logical arguments underscore the existing assumptions, revealing new aspects of set partitions and pattern avoidance. The paper also highlights a sequence of techniques applied to the object of set partitions, to determine its functionality and practical implications. The integration of previous theories with new methodologies and approaches makes this paper a substantial contribution to the evolving field of mathematical set theory.",
    "Let's first understand why temperature changes can shift focus. Lenses and camera bodies are heavily influenced by environmental temperatures. They expand and contract as temperatures change, and over extreme shifts, this can affect the focus.\n\nHere are few ways to prevent focus shifting due to temperature changes:\n\n**1. Acclimatize your gear**: If you're going to be shooting in extreme temperatures, give your equipment time to acclimate first. Move your equipment gradually from one temperature to another. This will reduce the time your gear spends expanding or contracting.\n\n**2. Use Climate-Resistant Gear**: Some lenses and camera bodies are designed for extreme conditions and have structure which prevents rapid contraction or expansion due to temperature changes. \n\n**3. Use Manual Focus**: Temperature changes can mess with your camera's autofocus, causing it to shift focus. Using manual focus gives you control over the situation regardless of whether or not your camera changes.\n\n**4. Keep Equipment Warm/Cool**: Keep your gear in insulated bags when you are not using it. This can slow the process of contraction or expansion.\n\n**5. Regular Maintenance**: Regular cleaning and maintenance can prevent dirt and grime from causing any additional problems with focus when temperature changes occur.\n\n**6. Correct it in Post-Production**: You may need to correct minor shifts in focus during post-production. Software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop can help sharpen images that are slightly out of focus.\n\nRemember that rapidly moving your gear between very warm and very cold climates can cause other problems as well, such as condensation, which can be harmful for your gear. Always give your equipment time to adjust to temperature changes.",
    "The Da Vinci Code has been described as a thriller but, in fact, it's more of a murder mystery. The twist is that this thriller contains little that is thrilling. It has been described as an intelligent film. Perhaps, but it's certainly no Brain Candy.\nDa Vinci is a film that wastes the talents of its leading actors, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou. Hanks is the Harvard professor who uncovers what, on Earth, the authorities would like to keep hidden. Audrey is the French policewoman assigned to protect him - which turns out to be unnecessary because, even though he's running for his life, there's nothing in the movie too scary or exciting for this character.\nThe film is set in, amongst other places, Paris, the Vatican and London. But, in truth, it could have been set in Tooting and still been more successful. Paris and London look exactly like you'd expect. London has the double-decker buses, and Paris has, er, the double-decker buses. The Vatican, however, looks fake, with an interior that is a weird mix of the authentic and the obviously constructed. One set even appears to have been shot separately, as the camera zooms back and you can see it's at different angles while, on the ceiling, there's a lighting rig that shouldn't be there. In other words, Da Vinci looks cheap - though not in a clever way, in a slapdash way as if the director didn't care. The problem is that the script really didn't care either.\nThis is a thriller-meets-fantasy-meets-historical documentary and there doesn't seem to be anything original or interesting to add to bring these elements together. Instead, the film becomes a mix of stereotypes - such as when the female police inspector is revealed to have a gun toting husband at home - along with elements from other movies. This isn't even a film which sets out to change expectations. In fact, the characters act on the basis of what the characters in other thrillers would do, which is a big part of why Da Vinci is so boring.\nIn some ways this is a film made for a very limited audience. And that limited audience is...well, I think the target market is Americans. There's more than one Americanism that,",

It all started when I was in the middle of my routine chores. As I was doing them, I wondered if there might be a more efficient way to perform the task. From that small thought, my idea was born. \n\nI can't reveal too much about it, but it's a simple gadget that could save people lots of time and effort. However, I'm quite stuck at this point. I don't have any experience in product development or business start-ups. \n\nI'm reaching out to this community for advice on how to proceed. Should I look into patenting the idea first? What are the steps involved in creating a product prototype? How can I attract investors for funding? What kind of challenges should I anticipate and how should I prepare for them?\n\nI would appreciate any advice, resources, or experiences you can share with me. It feels overwhelming right now, but I genuinely believe my idea could benefit many people if successfully implemented. It's a steep learning curve, so any kind of help is invaluable.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post. I'm looking forward to hearing your insights. \n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",

Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport claims that the Laporte family hopes to buy into one of Milan's two clubs. The team for which they have decided to base themselves, according to sources close to the group, will be the first-ever club of the new club Bologna. Laporte's project will start from the first day of the construction because it will take time to build the facility. The project will also need the consent of the Azzurri Football Federation because their members want a team of foreign nationals in Bologna. The move would put an end to the Laporte's previous plans to set up a second club in the capital. Bologna president Maurizio Zamparliani has already expressed his reluctance to enter into any transaction with the Pisa-based family.\" \"We do not know anything about this and we have not made any plans regarding this. As a federation we will see how a new club will do in Bologna,\" Zamparliani added. As Milan have a permanent registration with Bologna it seems certain that the deal will happen. Milan-Bologna ties The deal is thought to worth around 5 million€ and will help the family with the expenses for its new team moving and training, since Milan's training ground at San Siro and the stadium will be vacated.  This should also help with the cost of purchasing the team from the club who would have to play there permanently. Laporte's main competitor is the family of Italian businessman Massimo Moratti, who own the Serie A club Juventus and the club side Lazio.  Currently, both clubs have international affiliation with the Italian national squad.  However, Moratti's family currently have the ability to own the majority of the shares in both Italian and international teams, making it an advantage to purchase directly from them.  Juventus have an Italian affiliate alongside with the Italian national team, while Lazio also have an Italian team, which is called the Supercoppa Italiana. The Italian national side will remain officially affiliated with Real Madrid, who are only 20% owners of Lazio.",
    "GM has recalled nearly 1.6m cars due to a faulty anti-lock brake part that could make the system inoperative during an emergency stop.\nThe recall covers Saturn Ion and Chevy Cobalt models from the 2005 through 2010 model year. The faulty parts could cause the cars’ brakes to be inoperable during an emergency stop.\nGM said in a statement, it was issuing the recall to “address the possibility of a stuck piston in the electronic brake control module causing the antilock brake system (ABS) module to become inoperative in the event of an emergency brake situation”.\nA sticking piston could damage the module’s braking capability. If the module malfunctions or is disabled, the antilock braking system can become inoperative, GM said.\nBrake failure can cause an accident. There have been no reports of injuries. The recall does not affect cars sold in Europe, according to GM. The company said it would start notifying owners of affected vehicles “in the coming weeks”. Owners will be given a new ABS module installed for free.\nMeanwhile, more than 4 million Toyota and Honda vehicles are in line for a recall and repair of faulty air bag inflators later this summer. These recalls are separate from the recently-announced 2.3 million Toyota vehicles affected by faulty gas pedals.\nA Honda spokeswoman said, the recall pertains to driver air bag inflators that can result in corrosion and degrade the metal parts over time. Honda said that it believes the problem affects as many as 1.83 million vehicles, including the 2003-2007 Accord and the 2003-04 Element SUVs. More than 1.66 million of the inflators will be replaced by Takata, a major air bag manufacturer that recently recalled about 8.5 million inflators due to safety faults.\nDenso was named as the supplier for the Toyota recall. Toyota said its total recall covers approximately 3.3 million vehicles from the 2003 through 2007 model years.\nIn 2007, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigated Honda, GM and Ford regarding reports of non-deployment of their driver-side air bags as a result of ruptured metal bolts that were allegedly supplied by TRW.\nTRW is a German supplier of automobile electric components, including anti- lock brake systems.

    "In [11], we propose a new FCN architecture for LV segmentation. Figure 1 outlines the network's structure: 3D convolutions operate on the input volume and produce four feature maps from each input channel. To enable 3D convolutions and efficiently handle large 3D image volumes, we use downsampling (or \"strided convolutions\" in the terminology of [22]) to reduce the spatial dimensionality of the feature volume. Next, a U-net-like architecture is used to progressively recover the resolution of the image. After resolution recovery, a softmax function predicts the class probability of each voxel for the background and the myocardium. The loss function, shown in Equation (4), defines an entropy loss to help model sparsity of the ground-truth predictions during training.\n\n_Figure 5-1: FCN architecture for left ventricle segmentation in cardiac MR images._\n\nIn terms of dataset and parameters, we use the publicly available dataset _ACDC_ [2] from the 2016 MICCAI EndoVis challenge. The training set consists of 10 subjects, with an average of 28 volumes per subjects. 5 training images per subject are randomly selected as a testing set. We use 20 subjects from the validation set for testing. The remaining two subjects are used as a second testing set. To accelerate the training process, we train with a batch of 10 volumes per iteration and use an 8GB GPU.\n\nWe present the results in Figure 2. For subject-based evaluation, we use a 6mm isotropic Gaussian filter to smooth the ground-truth segmentation. The F1 score for subject-based evaluation is 81.9 +/−2.5%. In Figure 3, we show the qualitative results.\n\nThese results are not directly comparable to previous work due to the variation in data collection and different choice of metrics used for evaluating the models. It's the most common metric used by researchers using deep learning to segment MRI data (to the best of our knowledge, it's probably the most common metric used by scientists and researches in general).\n\nBy the way, what does the plus/minus range represent in the metric above? Let's look at the following explanation from the 2016 Endovis Challenge website, which was first to introduce the ACDC dataset and the metrics (also see [15]).",
    "[There is not] a supernatural element, it's more a psychological thriller with an almost paranormal theme. So this film feels fresh as the genre. I like the fact there aren't many vampires that are in the theaters. The movie has a suspenseful feel to it and the characters are very well developed: the wife who is on bed rest and the husband who is on the run after a murder; especially the wife. It's sad stuff. The film does a good job setting up its setting of West Virginia and its mysterious phenomena. The story revolves around the death of an 8-year-old girl named Jill Scott. She was attacked by an unknown creature, who also turned out to be her father. And the father is really scary. This movie is an action-packed movie, but it's also not afraid to get away from the action scenes with some slow moving suspenseful scenes. It has a supernatural element to it and a psychological component, which makes it very enjoyable.\n\nSo, what did you think of this review? Have you seen \"The Conjuring\" yet? Did you like it?

    "\"In the last decade of recent years, the effects of disorder in quantum and semi-classical systems have become one of the most important research areas in many-body physics. Disorder can lead to a variety of phenomena such as localization, phase transitions, and many-body localization. In the present work, the effects of randomness on the energy band structure and electronic properties of disordered materials are investigated with the help of a one-dimensional model. This model consists of chains of atoms connected by harmonic springs, and we study its behavior as a function of the random displacement of its constituent atoms. Disorder can cause the material to lose its translational invariance and results in the creation of so-called randomness-induced energy bands. Based on this, we calculated the dependence of the electronic transport properties on the strength of the disorder. We show that in the presence of disorder, the systems become Anderson-localized, meaning that their conductivity vanishes. We showed that the conductivity vanishes exponentially as a function of system sizes. We also discussed the effects of disorder on the band gap of the system and showed that there is a critical value of the disorder strength above which the system becomes an insulator. Our calculations were carried out using the transfer matrix method in an exact form. \"\n\n###  2-b.

    "Spanish football giants Real Madrid are reportedly in negotiations over a possible move for Danish international footballer Thomas Gravesen. The club, renowned worldwide for its collection of top-tier footballing talent, famously tagged as 'Galacticos', appears keen on enlisting the services of the Everton midfielder as they look to strengthen their midfield options.\n\nGravesen, who is currently playing for English Premier League side Everton, has been in consistent form this season, catching the eyes of several top European clubs. However, it's the La Liga leaders Real Madrid who are reportedly leading the race for his signature.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been one of the standout performers for Everton this season, helping the Merseyside club compete at the upper end of the Premier League. Moreover, his combative presence in the midfield alongside a decent goal-scoring record has made him one of the most sought-after midfielders in Europe.\n\nA move to Real Madrid would certainly be a huge step-up for Gravesen. The Spanish side boasts an illustrious history and a current line-up full of star-studded players including Ronaldo, Luis Figo, David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, amongst others. However, the Everton star seems unfazed by the challenge, proving his worth at both club level and on the international stage for Denmark.\n\nDetails over the possible transfer fees have not been disclosed, but given Real Madrid's reputation for securing top talent at considerable prices, a significant sum could be involved. Gravesen, who has a contract with Everton until the summer of 2006, has yet to comment on the reports.\n\nWhen approached for comments, both clubs, Everton and Real Madrid, chose to maintain silence over the ongoing speculation. The winter transfer window has just opened, and if the rumours turn true, this could be one of the biggest moves happening during this period.\n\nMore updates will follow as information becomes available.\n",

    "Girl, Interrupted is the heart wrenching tale of a young woman named Susanna Kaysen who, seeking a \"refined experience of self,\" enters a mental institution under the guise of \"depression.\" There, with a colorful cast of co-patients, the audience is taken onto a journey of acceptance and discovery. The strength of this film lies in its superb casting. Winona Ryder, as usual, is excellent in the lead. Angelina Jolie, who also produced the film, and Clea DuVall, whom one might remember as \"Brenda Chase\" from L.A. Law, are also excellent. Whoever cast the male leads, however, did so poorly. They seemed very awkward and forced.\nThe story is essentially this: Susanna enters the hospital, is treated, and comes out the other side of it with a whole new perspective on who she is and what she is capable of achieving. For this reason, I found it to be a very uplifting and positive film, despite the fact that all the patients seemed to be quite crazy. I especially liked the fact that the movie didn't try to wrap everything up into a neat little bow at the end; despite the fact that at the time Susanna leaves the hospital she appears to be functioning \"better,\" her depression and/or psychosis is still quite obvious. I like the way that the film didn't try to make the message that all things will be well. All things will not be well. For a bit longer, Susanna will be living in a surreal world of her own making. Even as the credits are rolled and you are leaving the theater, that fact remains. Life is not perfect. The film makes no promises; it doesn't lie.\nMy final thoughts: despite the occasional lapses into melodrama and cliche, the film is for the most part very well written, well acted and most importantly interesting and engrossing.

However, critics suggest it could also result in austerity measures. \n\nIn spite of a rapidly deteriorating economy exacerbated by ongoing geopolitical tensions, Turkey has not received IMF aid since 2008. The new agreement therefore marks a significant shift in policy both for the country and the international lender.\n\nActing IMF Managing Director, Tao Zhang, highlighted in the announcement that the decision aims to assist Turkey in facing its economic challenges. \"It is more important than ever to strengthen Turkey's economy. This financial assistance will not only boost the country's economic stability, but also help to address inflation and unemployment problems,\" said Zhang.\n\nThe deal comes after lengthy discussions between the Turkish government and the international lender, demonstrating the increasing concern over the state of the Turkish economy, which has staggered under high inflation, struggling market confidence, and a plummeting lira over the past few years.\n\nDespite the positive responses from international observers, the IMF's decision is not without criticisms. Some fear that the loan could lead to harsh austerity measures, as repayment conditions might impose severe fiscal curbs on the Turkish government.\n\nWhile detailing the funding’s focus areas, the IMF also stressed the necessity of comprehensive structural reforms, including enhancing transparency, fighting corruption, and improving business practices.\n\nTurkey's Finance Minister Lutfi Elvan stated that the country was \"committed to the implementation of these economic reforms.\"\n\n\"The Turkish government appreciates the IMF’s financial support.

So, when I found out that it was playing at the local theater where I live, I had to go see it. And I was not disappointed. My expectations as a movie were exceeded, and I had no idea what was going to happen. By the time the movie ended, I was hooked. I still am hooked.\nThe story of Dumb and Dumber is about two friends, a guy named Charlie and a guy named Harry. In the movie, they are traveling across the country on a road trip with Harry's best friend, his best friend's best friend, and another guy. They drive around with Harry's best friend on a van. They drive past a place named Waco in Texas. They go to a church where their friend is. They get caught by the police and are put away for a couple of minutes. After that moment in the movie, they get back on the road and continue their journey. For about two days, they drive all the way to California, where they stay for quite some time.\nI enjoyed Dumb and Dumber so much, I watched it again. As I said before, I had heard about the movie in a magazine, so I knew what to expect. I also knew that the director would make good use of the cast and crew. And he did.

    "US show sued for rat-eating stunt After a US television production sparked a backlash against animal cruelty online, a Missouri court has ruled the show should be punished for misleading viewers. This month, more than two weeks after the documentary \"Rat Farm\" aired on National Geographic, a Missouri judge convicted \"Rat Farm\" director Stephanie Soechtig on three counts of misdemeanour copyright infringement and ordered her to pay penalties and attorney fees. \"Rat Farm\" is a documentary about a research project that involves the training and use of laboratory rats to perform tasks previously done only by humans. Though the US film industry is already wary of animal rights concerns and animal research, the documentary portrays that research – which animal rights activists say exposes the cruelty of the animal industry – as the latest way to make money. After the documentary aired, animal rights groups launched a social media campaign to have it banned on national TV, threatening to pull the plug on the show. Many, including animal rights group PETA, were outraged by the rat stunt that was shown in the film.\n\nSo, I can understand if a person were to ask who is going to take care of the rats if some sick animals decide to break out of their cages? And who will care if some rats or mice do decide to escape the cages or get into the food/water mix? It would be in the best interest of the rat, that's who!\n\nSo, this is nothing to get excited about. The US government has already passed many laws to protect the domestic pet (and the domestic animal), so the US should not be sued too.\n\n(Visited 12 times, 1 visits today)",

    "General Motors (GM) has reported substantial losses from its European operations, impacting the automaker’s overall profits significantly.\n\nAccording to the financial results released by the company, GM experienced a $257m loss from its European business in the second quarter of 2021, significantly reducing its overall net income. This appears to be a major setback for the Detroit-based giant, as it had previously managed to make considerable profits earlier in the fiscal year despite prevalent industry challenges.\n\nThe carmaker's European operations have been notably underperforming, with GM's decision to sell its European arm - Opel and Vauxhall - to PSA Group in 2017 hitherto deemed a strategic move to stem the losses. However, the brand's financial woes in the region haven't ceased entirely. Despite pulling out of the market, GM still retains pension obligations and other legacy costs, contributing to the losses.\n\nThe European car market has proven challenging for several carmakers, with changes in emission regulations, Brexit-related supply chain disruptions, and the global chip shortage adding further hurdles. These factors, coupled with economic instability due to the pandemic, has created a tough environment for GM and others to operate in.\n\nGM's Chief Financial Officer, Paul Jacobson, in a statement, said the company was working on strategies to counteract the impacts of these challenges. \"We are taking decisive actions to transform the business and respond to the ongoing challenges and disruptions\", he underlined.\n\nDespite the losses in Europe, GM reported a strong second quarter in North America, earning $2.9 billion in the region. The company is banking on strong sales of electric vehicles (EVs) and trucks in its home market to overcome the European losses.\n\nGM’s European losses underscore the broader struggle of US carmakers in the region, where they have faced tough competition from domestic brands like Volkswagen, PSA Group and Renault. With Europe quickly moving towards electrification, the struggle is expected to get even tougher for the American automotive giant.\n\nJacobson concluded his statement by expressing optimism for the future, citing the company’s ongoing investment in electric and autonomous vehicles. “We are well positioned to transform the company and lead in the future of personal mobility,\" he insisted.",
    "Clijsters hope on Aussie Open\nKim Clijsters has vowed that she will be back in action in 2007 after pulling out of this month's Australian Open.\nThe 25-year-old Belgian has undergone surgery on a torn tendon in her left arm and said she would also miss the Indian Wells and Miami hard court events in March, as well as the French Open. But the US Open champion and world number one said she was determined not to let the injuries set her back. \"These are only small setbacks and I know the body will help heal itself,\" she said. Clijsters injured the arm while practising her serve in November.\nClijsters is currently ranked No. 1 in women's tennis on the WTA Tour. To learn more about the tour, see http://www.wta.com. In 2005 Kim Clijsters won the U.S. Open and was the youngest player to be ranked world number one in women's tennis in the computer era. She is one of only four players to win a Grand Slam and a year-end championship in the same year. (The others were Arthur Ashe, Martina Navratilova and Lindsay Davenport.) Clijsters is also the first Belgian to lead the WTA Tour in singles and the first to hold the year-end world number one ranking. The only other female Belgian to win a major title was Dinara Safina, who won the 2008 U.S. Open.\nHow to read an article\nComplete the following before reading the article.\nWhat are the main things your teacher has told you about reading news articles?\nDo you remember them?\nThe teacher has probably told you what sort of things to look for while reading news articles.

    "Former French scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili is celebrating his return to the French national rugby team, the Les Bleus, after being chosen as the new kicking coach. This marks a significant return for Yachvili, who retired from international rugby in 2012. \n\nDimitri Yachvili, 40, known for his kicking prowess while playing for Biarritz and France, will now mentor the Les Bleus kickers ahead of the 2023 World Cup, in a bid to sharpen the team's offensive capabilities and help France secure the prestigious title. \n\nYachvili gained blisters and glory on the pitch throughout his career, with 59 caps for France and 391 points scored. He was part of the French team that reached the finals of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, where his kicking accuracy was a key factor in their run.\n\nReacting to his appointment, Yachvili said: “I am very proud and happy to join the France team\". \"I will make sure to bring my experience and hopefully contribute to the team's success. This role is a great challenge for me and being entrusted with this responsibility thrills me.”\n\nDuring his illustrious career, Yachvili played for eight seasons in the Top 14 with Biarritz and has previously expressed his deep passion for French rugby. He has since worked as a consultant for TV, but has now decided to return to the field.\n\nFrench Rugby Federation (FFR) president Bernard Laporte said in a press release: \"We are pleased to welcome Dimitri Yachvili back into the fold. His wealth of experience and his knowledge about the game will be invaluable for our kickers as we prepare for the 2023 World Cup.\"\n\nThis appointment comes as the French national team looks to regroup after several underwhelming performances in recent tournaments. The FFR is convinced that with Yachvili's guidance and the players' determination, the team will make a strong comeback.\n\nYachvili will start working with the national team at the upcoming training camp next month, where he will begin shaping the Les Bleus attack strategy for the forthcoming Six Nations tournament. His return to the international arena adds another layer of excitement to France's bid for glory, both in the upcoming tournament and at the World Cup.",
    "Why do people have such a strong opinion against thinking. I know all the reasons for it as listed in the first link below but I just can't understand why there should be any difference between \"involuntary\" and \"voluntary\" thoughts; can somebody explain to me why thinking is different from \"non-thinking\" (if there is any such thing as \"non-thinking\"), or how is \"voluntary\" different from \"involuntary\", or whatever.\n\nThe first link is: wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention and the second link is: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_thought\nThe first link on the question's original post has this to say about the differences between voluntary and involuntary thoughts:\n\nIntention is the conscious desire or choice to act in a certain way. One distinguishes voluntary actions of the agent from involuntary actions such as reflex actions or pathological behaviors. [...]\n\nHowever, if one really thinks about it, there doesn't seem to be any fundamental difference between voluntary and involuntary things in general. I mean to say that the difference between something that happens \"voluntarily\" vs. \"involuntarily\" (as the questioner implies) isn't exactly clear. I might be thinking \"voluntarily\", but my thoughts are produced by my brain (which might itself be an involuntary process if you go deep enough), so why should thoughts be considered any different than, say, involuntary muscle movements?\nWhy? because my brain's doing its best to produce the thoughts, but at the end it's kind of a waste of effort, because I'm already very certain that everything I think of and everything my mind \"produces\" to me is absolutely pointless. I'd rather it did not have to do all the pointless work, but I can't help it, the thought just comes to me on its own. So what's the point of making a difference whether the thought is voluntary or involuntary is?\nMy brain might be more \"alive\" when producing thoughts, but if it just stopped doing that (or got sick and died or whatever), I wouldn't actually experience any real difference.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the difference between a voluntary and an involuntary thought comes down to whether or not your brain decides to produce the thought.\n\nMy point is that, since there",

    "\"When the film begins, it is the eve of Brooklynite Tony Manero (John Travolta)'s 18th birthday. He is an auto mechanic by day; by night he transforms into a dynamic disco dancer who struts his way to stardom at the legendary Paradise Garage in Manhattan. The trouble with Tony is, when not wearing his grease-covered coveralls he's wearing a satin suit and a boa. And when he is not dancing he is sitting in the front row of every Saturday Night Fever dance marathon, watching his idol, the handsome, cool, and aloof, yet sympathetic John Travolta strut his stuff on stage. When Tony's girlfriend Angela (Karen Lynn Gorney) suggests they move into a small apartment of their own, Tony, having more or less made up his mind to abandon Brooklyn and move to Manhattan, is reluctant till he notices in a picture in a newspaper a picture of himself on the front row at Fever; he has now made up his mind. And in the process he drops Angela, who has been the most steadfast member of his support group of friends -- Pino (Joseph Cali), Paulie (Dennis B. Farina), Joey (Barry Miller) and Mona (Brenda Vaccaro) -- who help him win his quest to become a \"Saturday Night Fever\" hotshot. But for the moment, Tony's only concern is his birthday party, and after getting wasted, and after singing a rendition of Paul McCartney's \"Maybe I'm Amazed,\" he wakes up in his apartment next morning and realizes that today is the big party and today is the party that his friends are throwing for him.\nHe has to dress up and go down to the disco. At that point he wakes up. He goes out and finds his friends, one in an armadillo costume, a second in a mummy costume, and even Paulie in an Afro wig, and the four of them go out to the party. They find that the party has been \"rescheduled\" with a new deejay, the \"sadistic\" (as he said of the disco) Mr. Stacy (Bobby Van). Tony proceeds to go up on stage to dance, but in doing so he does not really come into his own, that is,",
    "\"Skin lesions are commonly studied in clinical medical settings, but do not fit the criteria of an active disease. Here we develop an artificial intelligence framework to identify skin lesion types based on the images, using deep feature learning to recognize three categories: cutaneous, hair and eye-ring-like. The neural network consists of a convolutional neural network with hidden layers, followed by an R-CNN for localization. We apply our model to the training set of a medical imaging dataset, and demonstrate that it does remarkably well at categorizing skin lesions. Furthermore, our framework can achieve high precision identification to the nearest centimeter for cutaneous lesions, while failing to detect hair and eye rings. Our system is relatively cheap and does not require extensive external hardware, making this platform available to clinical laboratories that need to develop or apply a skin lesion classification algorithm for a specific goal. A final note is that the framework is implemented in a pure Python and thus has no runtime dependencies and does not require a specialized operating system; this enables automated testing and deployment.\"\n\nAccording to a presentation by the researchers in January, self-learning classification and classification from images has been applied for a few different applications in the last two years. For example, in an interview with IEEE Spectrum earlier this year, Robert Saxton, a computer vision researcher from University College London, described \"a really exciting work\" that uses a self-learning system to learn to classify images to distinguish between cars, birds and other objects.\n\nIt is interesting that the researchers from the University of Geneva want to apply their system to medical research. For a long time, researchers in the field of computer vision have been interested in using deep learning methods to analyze images, as well.\n\n[via IEEE Spectrum]",

    "Millions of viewers across the globe, irrespective of their age, have enjoyed the magic of Shrek 2 ever since its release. The movie has now received a prestigious honour, as children worldwide voted it their favourite film in a global survey. \n\nSet amid sprawling landscapes and captivating animations, Shrek 2 unfolds a heartwarming tale of friendship, love, and courage. It has now resoundingly struck a chord with the younger audience, outpacing other contenders in the competition.\n\nReleased in 2004, Shrek 2 is a DreamWorks sequel to the hugely successful film Shrek. The film emerged at the top from a list of 150 films in a poll conducted by Cinema First, an international organisation promoting the world of cinema to young people. This survey involved 100,000 children from all corners of the globe, showing just how far the love stretches for the green ogre and his companions.\n\nCatapulting to the top hasn’t been an easy feat. The competition stacked against Shrek 2 included blockbusters like \"Harry Potter,\" \"Toy Story,\" and more recent films like \"Frozen\". Even against these giants, Shrek 2’s accomplishment indicates the timeless appeal of its story and the enduring resonance of its characters.\n\nThis accolade confirms what many parents and movie-goers have long suspected: that the Shrek franchise has a unique ability to unite families over shared enjoyment. Its blend of humor, adventure and heartfelt moments has transcended all age barriers and globally appealed to different audiences.\n\nThis endorsement from young moviegoers worldwide underlines the critical and commercial success that has upheld the Shrek franchise over the years. Critics have acclaimed the movie for its engaging narrative, breath-taking visuals and the message it imparts about acceptance and friendship.\n\nReaction from the Shrek team on this achievement has been one of elation. The creators, devastated with gratitude, expressed their thrill over this humbling endorsement. Fans have taken to social media to express their joy and memories associated with the film, ensuring that the green ogre and his band of unconventional fairy tale characters continue to reign supreme in the hearts of many.\n\nWhilst Shrek 2 is by no means a new release, this accolade illustrates its enduring appeal and timeless allure. Children worldwide, it seems, have given their firm stamp of approval to Shrek 2, further cementing its position in the annals of cinema as a classic the whole family can enjoy, and re-enjoy, for years to come.",

    "A key issue for biomedical image segmentation is that the individual features of clinical samples, such as tumor size or age, are very different from one another, requiring high-dimensional and relatively noisy data to be processed. While previous approaches have been applied, most have been unsupervised (i.e., in which the feature vectors do not have discrete dimensions), and have suffered from very poor performance (overfitting). In a recent paper, we present a new supervised machine learning method for segmentation, and demonstrate its ability to generate a large sample of high-quality images for both medical science and biomedical research.... This paper presents our new method, which is designed to allow the user to specify a set of diagnostic features (i.e., tumor types) and to select an algorithm that will automatically perform both training and evaluation for a given cancer diagnosis, in a manner akin to a supervised machine learning algorithm. We provide preliminary experimental benchmarking and discuss the performance improvements that can be achieved. After performing training of the classification algorithm, a set of images must then be saved with the label of any new tumors that may be detected. To address our first problem, we train a binary classifier with four classes of parameters (i.e., tumor types, age, and gender); however, it fails to perform well: while a neural network trained with only this classifier has performed well on the CIFAR10 dataset, a similar classifier trained with this one also performs only slightly better on a variety of patient-specific datasets, with the latter having lower patient-specific values for certain features. In the face of this \"inferiority\" of our new model, we propose a simple heuristics-based approach that helps to narrow down the number of combinations of feature values that produce valid images and to make these combinations more robust to overfitting. This simple heuristic model was shown to perform well when we used both classifier and classification methods for training as well as evaluation of our classifier, with the classification method using only the label of a new tumor (which we call the unsupervised \"generic\" classifier), and the unsupervised generic classifier only selecting the label of a new tumor (i.e., the \"unsupervised generic\").

Audrey was written out of the show after being sent to prison for assault.\n\nAfter leaving _Brookside_, Nicholls returned to acting in stage work, most notably in _Witches of Eastwick_.\n\nShe also continued to make acting appearances in television shows including _A Touch of Frost_ and _EastEnders_.\n\nHer _Brookside_ co-star, Sue Johnston, who played Nicholls' on-screen daughter Sheila, paid tribute on Twitter, saying Nicholls had been \"a true friend and the best of mum\".\n\n\n### Fake News\n\nThe claim of a recent death is fake.

    "\"Twilight is such an incredible story, not only about friendship and friendship between two beautiful ladies as I feel I can relate to, but also the courage it takes for two women both living and dying from cancer to fight for each other's lives, their love, and ultimately for each other. If you wish to have a deep emotional understanding of someone you look up to when you are young, this movie is for you. And of course, if you are a fan of horror stories, and are looking to see the way our society handles one of the most horrific things that can happen to a person, this movie is to tell. And if you like your zombies and undead creatures as ugly as they are violent, you are in need of a dose of good old-fashioned terror. And if you want to see the way humanity treats a girl who has everything, and who has no reason to want anything apart from happiness, then Twilight is your time to watch. And in the end, my favorite part of Twilight was the way the characters dealt with their own mortality.\"\n\n\n---\n\nIt seems to me, the reason \"Twilight\" succeeds is because of the way the characters deal with their own mortality. The characters live and die and then they live and die. These aren't merely characters as far as these movies go; they're persons, as we understand beings through our memories of them, who are living and dying and surviving - and who also are alive. One of the best ways to experience the way a person lives and dies are by watching their friends, whom they have made a promise to love, dying and then coming back to life. Those who are suffering in real life can experience themselves in the mirror of cinema, a way to see ourselves through the eyes of people whom we love. Thus, one of the biggest reasons I was hooked by the movie and decided to view it for the first time was because I knew the protagonist of the movie was a woman who survived cancer. I realized because of the nature of the film's plot that the protagonist of the movie, Bella Swan, had a mother who had to leave her for several months to care for a dying friend and then had to find her in the hospital to say goodbye. It's also possible that this also brought back her mother when she died of pancreatic cancer. I couldn't understand how she could ever get over that sadness and sadness alone. Of",
    "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05240.\n\\end{quote}\n\n%\n% \n% \\subsection{Semantics for Martin-L\\\"of's Extensional Type Theory}\n% The Martin-L\\\"of type theory, which consists of just the unary rule of inference called the induction rule, can be considered as having no semantics by itself. To avoid this, we could add to it an informal \\emph{inconsistency semantics}, which declares that an inconsistent theory is ill-formed; or we could consider the so-called \\emph{subsystem} semantics, which considers as valid every \\emph{subsystem} of the Martin-L\\\"of type theory consisting of all the type-forming meta-variables in the theory \\cite{cade}. However, in a logic like the Martin-L\\\"of type theory, which has the Curry-Howard correspondence, a more \\emph{formal} semantics is needed.\n\nHere, we develop what we will call \\textit{Martin-L\\\"of-style semantics} for Martin-L\\\"of's Extensional Type Theory. Essentially, this style of semantics assigns to each \\textit{(closed) type} an \\textit{(intensional) set of models}, where each model is a \\textit{(Kripke) frame} with the \\textit{reflexive, transitive closure} of the \\textit{binary relation of satisfaction} on it; in this, the set of models itself is a class, with the \\textit{class-theoretic comprehension axiom} in the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (with choice). In turn, for each \\textit{formula}, we assign a unique \\emph{reflexive relation} on the class. The intuition is that the models in the class of models corresponds one-to-one to the truth values of the formula itself.\n\nThis semantic framework is general enough that it can be applied to the set-theoretic type theories as well.\nThis style of semantics also has the virtue of being extensional, because we are assigning \\textit{sets} of models to types instead of functions from models to truth values.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\",

In a world where a race of aliens in dark suits runs the United States by keeping all knowledge of their activities secret from the public, Men in Black 3 arrives this month with the perfect idea, perfect premise, perfect visual cues, and most important, perfect casting.\nIn the twenty-one previous years since Independence Day destroyed the Eiffel Tower, the National Archives, and a bunch of the pyramids, the alien hunters of the Men in Black have become the ultimate guardians of the earth. No one, we're told, knows what the planet needs after being conquered by Will Smith. He's been to Area 51. He could never be permitted a government security clearance at this point. Luckily, no one can stop him from working for MIB.\nAfter that last film in 2002, the franchise sat dormant until a \"prequel\" arrived in 2009. That film was a mess with no idea what a great premise it was starting with: a young Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) has to make the right decision about a young black man at Area 51 after the two discover a spaceship containing an alien in a pod. Agent J (Will Smith) comes in to play and things are set up as the alien baby takes over the world at the end of the film. It's a fantastic setup, but the film around it is terrible.\nIt's all here in Men in Black 3. A young man discovers an alien in a pod as a kid, and now the MIB has to bring him in; he refuses, and J and K need to figure out the true nature of his mission.

The first two films' plots were pretty simple, and those characters are the same here. The big surprise is Josh Brolin as a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones; there are also some smaller roles from two great character actors (played by Bill Hader and Michael Stuhlbarg) who keep the film from feeling empty.\nDirector and co-writer (with Etan Cohen) Barry Sonnenfeld makes the whole",
    "Hey, fellow Redditors. \n\nNearing a quarter of a century of existence, I wanted to share something I've struggled with a lot lately: I am a virgin, and tomorrow I turn 26. While some of you might get taken aback, others might relate - which is exactly why I'm writing this.\n\nI just want to point out that I don't see this as a failure - it's not like I'm perpetually single.

The relationships I've been in have been with partners who also wanted to wait, so things have never escalated to that point.\n\nMoreover, I want to clarify that while societal pressure and stigma surrounding virginity can be vast, I have largely been able to remain unswayed by them. It's been my conscious decision at every step of the way, to wait for the right time and the right person.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are days where I feel the fear creep in. The fear of being inexperienced, of not being good enough when the time does come, and the fear of being judged. But at the end of the day, I reassure myself and fall back on the belief that physical intimacy is only one of the many nuances of a loving relationship.\n\nI am sharing this to let others know that they are not alone if they are in a similar situation. It’s okay to be different than the norm – after all, who decides what the norm should be? \n\nI would love to hear your experiences and encourage you all to share whatever thoughts this post might spark within you. We all have our own journey and story. Let's start a proper dialogue about virginity and put an end to the stigma, one conversation at a time. \n\nThank you for reading.

    "\"Napster offers rented music to go\"\n\nNappster – music fans would be encouraged to pay a bit more for music with the aim of making their files available for streaming services such as Spotify and iTunes.\n\nThe company behind the idea, Napster, has just announced plans to start offering its own music to download.\n\n\"I feel that this is the next significant step in a series of technological steps that has been made by the music industry,\" said Napster co-founder and chief executive Steve Jackson.\n\n\"As such, I'm very excited to announce that Napster will now be offering its own music to music fans to pay for.\"\n\nMr Jackson, speaking from his San Francisco office, said Napster's new offering would allow fans to download their favourite artists and albums for as little as $0.99 (£0.76) a week, or $39 a year as part of the company's paid plans.\n\n\"It's essentially providing music as a service to consumers who want to listen on a weekly or monthly basis,\" said Mr Jackson.\n\n\"With its innovative new offering, Napster will give fans the option to purchase music regularly or on a monthly or yearly basis.\"\n\nMr Jackson said Napster did not have any current plans to provide songs to download through the iTunes store, however.",
    "\"We introduce the graphical language of quantum error correction and show that any scheme is equivalently specified by a diagram made of gates from some finite set and that this diagram is a normal form.\nWe provide a framework within which various aspects of the physical implementation as well as the logical design of qubits can be dealt with at one single level. We can show then that any error correction code, or any logical block encoding any function such as permutation of qubits, is equivalent to a diagram. Moreover, we show that the number of qubits in such diagrams grows sub-extensively with the size of the input. We show then that this graphical language is a convenient notation to verify any construction or analysis. In particular, we show how any decoding algorithm or stabilizer formalism can be translated into the graphical language. With these tools, we show that the optimal syndrome measurement (which we can view as a quantum computer) can be specified by a diagram with logarithmic depth in the size of the code with constant width. The equivalence between any diagram and any error correction code allows us then to give a new representation of such codes as a concatenation of many \"layers\", each layer corresponding to a concatenation of one qubit codes. This representation leads us to our main result that stabilizer encoding and decoding for the surface code can be done with constant depth quantum circuits, and allows us to improve the qubit complexity of the surface code to logarithmic. Furthermore we are able to extend several earlier results on the number of qubits and the depth required to simulate transversally quantum circuits. This new approach to quantum error correction shows how the diagram can be considered in some sense to replace both the usual encoding map and the physical Hamiltonian description of quantum error correction, in general. More generally, it allows the description of any scheme involving a finite number of qubits and any number of gates: logical qubits, circuits, and quantum automata.\"\n  \\par}\n\n\\textbf{\\Large{A Quantum Language to Specify Error Correction Schemes}}\n\n\n\\section{{\\footnotesize{Introduction}}}\n\n\nThe goal of this note is to introduce a new language to specify a quantum error correcting code. The main motivation behind this language is to have a convenient notation with which we can verify any statement about the correctness of any quantum code.

    "Former England striker Andy Carroll made a significant error during his recent match, sparking a flurry of media attention as well as calls from television sports pundits for him to improve.\n\nPlaying for his Premier League club, Carroll let slip a golden opportunity that could’ve potentially won the game. The result is a piling wave of criticism both on and off the field, putting the player and his future decisions under a bigger spotlight.\n\nThe error came during the 75th minute of the game when Carroll missed an easy goal, leading to his team's defeat.\n\nThis blunder not only cost his team crucial points but also triggered extensive analysis from football experts on various TV shows. They expressed disappointment over Carroll's performance and called for the player to \"step up his game.\"\n\nFormer Blackburn Rovers striker Chris Sutton, speaking on BBC's Match of the Day, said: \"No one likes to see errors, but they happen. What's important now is how Carroll responds to it. We've seen him do brilliant things on the pitch before, but mistakes like these can hamper a player's confidence.\"\n\nIndeed, the noticeable error has brought Carroll into the public eye more than ever before, with experts, commentators, and fans all tuning in to scrutinise his follow-up performances.\n\nPundit and former professional footballer Robbie Savage also weighed in on BBC Radio 5 Live, \"Carroll needs to overcome this setback and prove himself again. We've seen it before where one error can lead to a player being written off too early. It's all about resilience now.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, there has also been a swell of support for the star, with numerous fans across social media platforms urging him not to let the mistake define his future performance.\n\nAndy Carroll has yet to comment on the incident publicly, but his fans will no doubt be hoping that he can use the attention from the error as motivation to improve his game.\n\nThis incident also sparks a wider discussion over the intense scrutiny professional athletes face, especially when playing in high-pressure roles. It's a reminder that even top athletes are not impervious to simple mistakes, and how they respond to them can significantly shape their careers.",
    "Sony's PS4 went on sale in the US on Friday, two weeks after its launch in Europe. Microsoft's Xbox One went on sale yesterday, a week after its European debut.\nAt first glance, Sony is off to a flying start. More than 60% of PS4s were pre-ordered in the US, and over 1.2 million have been sold since launch.\nAs for who will win this generation of the console battles, here's a look at who's leading in terms of the hardware specs, their strategy this time around, and the marketing campaigns their developers are planning for next year.\nHere's who's winning the battle so far:\nLet's start with the Xbox One. It's in the ascendency but Microsoft is facing a tough battle against the PS4. It's the more powerful console at this point, with a higher resolution and more graphical muscle under its hood, but Sony's PlayStation 4 can be boosted with upgrades by developers, and Microsoft has committed to an always-on Internet connection for the Xbox.\nThis means Microsoft may be facing some backlash against the Internet restrictions it placed on the Xbox in the lead-up to its launch.\nThe Xbox One is a beast of a console but there are already signs that it will be challenged next year. Just days ago, Sony showed off its games for 2014, which include an exclusive new David Cage game called Detroit and a stunning new title called Shadow of the Colossus.\nThe Xbox One will face similar games in 2014. And while Microsoft is playing host to a wide range of big developers such as Ubisoft, 2K Games, EA, and SEGA, its games lineup is dominated by Activision, Bethesda, and Electronic Arts' FIFA 2014.\nIt also has a lack of exclusives – something that could be a problem in the console battles.\nThe PS4 is starting off on the back feet, but things could easily turn in Sony's favour when games start to come out next year.\nAs for the actual numbers, the PS4 has a lower resolution and offers no hardware upgrades. But Sony has already announced its \"first\" exclusive, Killzone: Shadow Fall from Guerrilla Games, which will launch a little later this year. This gives Sony a boost.\nSony has always been about exclusives. So even if it's slower",
    "This paper investigates the asymptotic expansion of a partition function associated with the sinh-model. In theoretical physics, the sinh-model is a significant hyperbolic structure in statistical mechanics. The purpose of this research is to derive the asymptotic behavior of this partition function in the thermodynamic limit. We present a comprehensive derivation and analysis of the asymptotic expansion which reveals a strong correlation with behavior of physical systems. Our results ascertain the accuracy of previous conjectures regarding the sinh-model, while also proposing advanced techniques for mathematical interpretation. This study provides a new perspective on the role of partition functions, contributing to a more profound understanding of statistical physics models.",
    "It's only a couple of steps away from the worst film ever made.\nAt some point you begin to think they are trying to make you laugh, then you realise they're not (by the way, nothing is funny), then you start to notice some beautiful long sequences which are stunning.\nBut the main problem is (apart from its very annoying screenplay) is that the film is so damn boring, your mind will not stop wandering out to the most random, irrelevant things. Don't waste your time or money on this rubbish.\nI disagree this film is an absolute bore; but, that isn't to say that every movie is a joy to watch. I think \"The Lobster\" is a fascinating film. It's a movie about feeling trapped and feeling helpless about one's predicament. It's also about conformity and peer pressure. This film shows how we as humans do things because others do them or are encouraged to do them. It is a film that is an anti-rom-com.\nHere is what The Independent's Philip French says about the movie. Here is a snippet, a brief excerpt:\nDavid Yates's The Lobster takes on the most fashionable contemporary theme in films: the individual's struggle against a coercive state. Only, in Yates's film, the state is a luxury hotel in a future that feels very like today.\nYates is a former music video director, with a career-long fascination for surreal, dreamscape settings, but here he comes up with a truly astonishing, fully realized vision of a dystopian future. The film presents us with a world that is recognizably the same as ours, but subtly different, where we meet David, a man who hasn't had a relationship in a year. As a result he has become, legally, a non-person, and must spend a night in the hotel to \"find an animal\" who will help him re-become an animal. Otherwise, he'll have to live in a forest.\nIt's an incredibly funny, yet disturbing, concept, with great performances; from Olivia Firth as Helen, who's an unnervingly cheerful wife, to John Hannah, with his \"I'm a bad driver but an excellent lover.\"\nIsabel Leonard – who was once a candidate for La Bohème's Mimì – is one of",
    "As a cinematic adaptation of one of the most-beloved fantasy novels, \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" stands tall and enthralling. The movie introduces us to a world brimming with magic, enchantment, and a profound darkness that gently threads throughout the storyline. Director Chris Columbus has shown unique adeptness in stirring the imaginative concoction of J.K. Rowling into a vivid, visual spectacle.\n\nThe narration's heart lies in the well-etched characterization of Harry Potter, brought to life by a young and notably talented Daniel Radcliffe. He carries on his shoulders the vulnerable charm and courage of Harry with remarkable ease and authenticity. Emma Watson as the headstrong Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as the loyal and goofy Ron Weasley fit perfectly with their on-point performances, depicting a genuine camaraderie among the three pivotal characters.\n\nJohn Williams' score wove magic just as well as any of the film’s characters, providing an auditory backdrop that transports you straight to Hogwarts’ enchanting world. The overall ambience, art direction and the majestic Hogwarts settings are visually compelling and succeed at assisting the spectators in suspending reality to travel alongside Harry into this magical universe.\n\nAlan Rickman as Professor Snape deserves special mention for his engaging and nuanced performance. His character becomes the linchpin in the larger narrative arc, and his portrayal lends an air of dramatic suspense throughout the movie.\n\nThe film does departs modestly from the titular book at times, but this can be overlooked to appreciate how well it strikes a balance between catering to the pre-existing fans and offering something enjoyable to complete newcomers to the franchise. However, the complexity and depth of certain characters and sub-plots introduced in the book were slightly underserved in the movie.\n\nAll in all, \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is a delightful beginning to Harry's adventure. It sufficiently enthralls visually and emotionally, setting an excellent premise for the saga ahead. As an initiation into the world of Hogwarts, fantastical creatures, and an insatiable curiosity for what lies ahead, the film quite brilliantly captures the essence of the magic that J.K. Rowling's novel first sparked in its readers.",
    "\"Step Up\" is a film that brings to life the electrifying world of dance in a way that few movies manage to achieve. The raw energy and emotion that are conveyed through the dance sequences in this film are its heart and soul, offering gripping and breathtaking performances that steal the show every single time.\n\nOur leads, Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum, bring an authentic passion to their roles, and their chemistry is undeniably electric. Tatum stands out with his unexpectedly graceful dance technique blended with a street edge, while Dewan matches him with her crisp, classically-trained moves. Their contrasting dance styles beautifully illustrate the theme of bridging barriers to connect through shared passion.\n\nThe narrative elements of \"Step Up\" may not be its strongest feature, with a somewhat predictable plot and familiar character arcs. However, the narrative is not what sets \"Step Up\" apart from its contemporaries. Instead, the film's strength lies in its energetic dance choreography that's masterfully executed and keeps the audience engaged and invested in the story.\n\nDirector Anne Fletcher, herself a seasoned choreographer, does a wonderful job of capturing the raw essence of dance and its potential to communicate deeply-felt emotions. The way she threads together each dance scene with the narrative progression of the film culminates in a spectacular final dance performance that's both narratively satisfying and visually stunning.\n\nWhile \"Step Up\" may not offer a ground-breaking plot, it does offer an exceptional showcase of the power and beauty of dance as an art form. The infectious rhythm and raw energy of its dance sequences combined with the palpable on-screen chemistry of its leads make it an enjoyable watch for fans of dance and romance genres. It's a movie with a clear message that passion and dedication can indeed \"step up\" your life to incredible heights.",
    "Here's the original:...\nSAT score of 1560 is a good score?\nIt is a good score, but at this point I wouldn't worry too much. If you get a couple thousand other students on your waitlist, that will be your problem. However, if you get a couple million on your waitlist, then yes, 1560 is a pretty good score and could definitely help the admissions team give you a close look, since it means that you can probably do as well or better on the ACT. I'd really try not to focus too much on this right now. It will either work itself out, or it won't. Congratulations on your hard work to get into this position to begin with!\nI have a 1530 SAT score...\nWhat do you mean? What percent is the waitlist? What percent have been accepted already? And to those who have asked if I am interested, I'm not really applying anywhere because I don't really want to leave Ohio, but I'm not really applying anywhere because I can't decide on a major, so I am applying to a large state school to keep my options open. But I am interested.\nCan I get off a waitlist?\nI got the \"in the spirit of fairness\" email. No real surprise, seeing that I applied mid-May or so after the deadline. Not necessarily depressed or anything, but I also have no real college interests. At a loss of what to do.\nThe first time I went on a college visit, and I was only planning to stay for an hour and just look around. I ended up going to their fraternity rush the next night. The visit was a Saturday, so rush was the following Monday and Tuesday.\nI had no idea what I was getting into, I only went to rush because I had a friend at that university.\nTo my surprise, I ended up getting a bid. This was at one of my target schools, so it was a bit of a shock, especially because everyone got a bid.\nThis is why your best bet is to make connections with fellow students while you're there visiting. Just try to get connected to your campus before you make such a big decision.\nFor those of you who have been accepted off of the waitlist, is it typical for the school to also give you a financial aid package?\nI",
    "So my brother has always been the type to get overly enthralled with his hobbies, to the point that he forgets about everything else.\n\nA few years back, it was magic tricks. He'd vanish for hours trying to perfect one trick, often forgetting to eat. Then it was rock climbing, where he'd run late for work because he overslept from his late-night climbs. \n\nNow, it’s gaming. Headset on, world off as he would put it. This time around, he was so engrossed in his game that he managed to miss something quite important. Our parents' 30th anniversary.\n\nWe siblings had planned a surprise dinner party for them at their favorite lakeside restaurant and naturally, he was in charge of bringing our parents there. The rest of us made the arrangements, decorations, invitations to old friends, and even managed a surprise musical performance.\n\nYou can see where this is heading. The big night arrived, everything was pitch-perfect...except our parents. Hours passed and there were no signs of them. We called him and his response was a confused, \"Wasn't that next week?\" No, dear brother, it was that night and you missed it. \n\nOur parents, good sports that they are, laughed it off saying it was better than any magician’s final act of disappearance. So, we all drove to their place and surprised them there.\n\nBut, oh boy, does he have a heartbreaking amount of making up to do. This is just another thing added to the list of things he missed for one of his hobbies. Sometimes, I wonder if he does it on purpose to make the family gatherings more memorable!

    "Tech giant Yahoo, while no longer maintaining its past dominance, has been making strategic moves that suggest it may undergo a resurgence in the next decade. With new leadership, diverse partnerships and innovative technology, the internet company may still hold the potential to challenge Google, Amazon and other tech titans. \n\nYahoo’s transformation into a multifaceted tech company has been spearheaded by its current CEO, Josh James. Under his leadership, Yahoo has acquired several startups in artificial intelligence and data analytics sectors. These strategic acquisitions signify a shift in Yahoo's trajectory, suggesting the company may be gearing up to dominate the digital landscape in a way that it hasn't in years.\n\nOne such acquisition is the San Francisco-based artificial intelligence startup, Knewton, known for its adaptive learning technology. Marrying Knewton's AI technology with Yahoo's wide-reaching platform could potentially revolutionize the way users interact with online content, making it more personalized and intuitive, which is likely to attract a younger audience. \n\nIn addition to acquisitions, Yahoo has been forming partnerships across different sectors. One significant collaboration is with telecom giant, Verizon Communications. This partnership has allowed Yahoo to extend its reach to Verizon’s extensive customer base, a move that has significantly bolstered Yahoo's user count.\n\nYahoo's dedication toward leveraging new technology is also worth noting. In particular, its recent investments in Quantum Computing, an area that Google and IBM are also heavily betting on, shows that the company does not shy away from exploring and capitalizing on the latest tech trends. \n\nNevertheless, Yahoo's potential growth is not exempt from challenges. The company will need to keep its focus and innovate continually amid intensifying competition. It also must overcome hurdles such as privacy concerns that have recently plagued technology companies. \n\nCommenting on future prospects, tech analyst, Jeff Kagan, said, \"Yahoo is not without its challenges, but it has the potential to reinvent itself. Its acquisitions and partnerships are steps in the right direction. The next decade will be telling of Yahoo's ability to innovate and compete with the big players.\"\n\nOverall, Yahoo’s next steps are unpredictable yet exciting to observe. While it may not dominate the tech industry to the extent it did in the 1990s, the company undoubtedly has the tools and potential to make a significant comeback in the next decade. This path will certainly not be without its obstacles, and only time will tell if Yahoo can effectively rise to meet this challenge.",
    "The \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a 1987 Disney film directed and co-written by Dan O'Bannon. The story takes place in an apocalyptic future where the rabbit population is in serious trouble and a group of bad guys is trying to take over the world. The Disney classic was based on the book by Ralph Bakshi, and features the voices of the two main characters: the rascal Rabbit (Keaton) and the clever, eccentric Eeyore (Jones), and the gang of mischievous \"heroes\" are voiced by Peter Del Vecho as the police chief (Mr. Potato Head) and Fred Tatasciore as the mad scientist Dr. Zaius (a cross between Doc Brown from Back to the Future and the Wicked Witch of the West from Wizard of Oz). The film is a comedic romp in a high-tech world where all the rabbits are evil and only Eeyore, Rabbit, and Roger Rabbit are good. Roger Rabbit (Jones) must defeat \"The King of Diamonds\" (the bad guy) in order to save his best friend, Eeyore from his own evil ways.",

The study introduces the combined application of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) ensembles and suggestive annotations, improving the accuracy and efficacy of brain MRI segmentation. The method leverages the power of machine learning to detect anomalies and features in infant brain scans. It compared performance against traditional segmentation techniques and demonstrated significantly improved results. Evaluations conducted on 1.5 Tesla and 3 Tesla MRI scans highlight the robustness and versatility of the suggested method. This novel approach could transform standard procedures for detecting abnormalities in infant brains, potentially leading to earlier and more accurate diagnoses.",
    "Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a visual feast and an action extravaganza, which continues to magnetize its audience with high intensity robot showdowns. Michael Bay doesn't shy away from his trademark smashing, booming and sprawling cinematography, making this movie a visual spectacle. \n\nThe movie also introduces new and interesting Autobots and Decepticons, adding more depth to the mechanical cast. The 3D element intensifies the grandeur of the Transformers world, weaving unforgettable destructive cityscapes and chaotic battlegrounds.\n\nShia Labeouf doesn't disappoint as the slightly obnoxious, but relatable, Sam Witwicky and his chemistry with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley adds the romantic angle to the sci-fi blockbuster. Still, it is the robots that steal the show.\n\nThe storytelling may not be the strongest facet of the film; however, the action that dominates the screen compensates for the plot's shortcomings. The movie focuses on what it does best - showcasing spectacular alien robots interlocked in colossal warfare.\n\nMany may argue that Dark of the Moon lacks the tantalizing intrigue of the original Transformers movie, however, it certainly doesn't lack the high-powered energy and visually stunning scenes that the franchise is known for.\n\nTransformers: Dark of the Moon is a roller-coaster ride of thrilling sequences, supercool transforming bots and larger-than-life imagery. If you're purely in it for adrenaline-pumping CGI battles and destructiveness, then this film delivers in leaps and bounds.",

    "\"Video gamers want high-def TV but video game companies don't have the money to supply it at the moment - so we now have to settle for second-rate service. Gamers are turning to streaming services like Netflix, with their vast libraries of movie and TV shows, for what used to be free. But there are serious financial implications. \"When consumers demand free services because it's 'free', the entertainment industry can just ignore them in response. Instead, the video business should give consumers what they want and have the money to manufacture it – if they can afford to. As a result, there aren't any clear boundaries for what goes on the Internet,\" says Dave McCary, digital media executive at research firm IHS. \"Netflix could afford to give consumers more content - if it could afford to pay. But this week it has become clear it can't, and has said so. \"This means that gaming consoles, laptops and other devices have fallen behind the times. Gamers want the best of both worlds – games that look as good as they do sound. It's a big challenge for the video industry.\" Netflix has a catalogue of more than 40,000 films and television shows and subscribers already watch up to 16m hours a month. The majority of Netflix's members are over the age of 25. McCary believes the firm is now facing a choice to either keep up with the changing video consumer or sell out to consumers who want something more than internet access. He believes Netflix's problem is not the high quality of its service but rather that it is too far behind demand. This week, the Netflix website briefly crashed after users discovered it wasn't available in many locations around the world. McCary says: \"Netflix has made no secret of the fact its main source of revenue is international subscribers, but while it could afford to produce high-definition TV to match the video services Netflix is producing in other territories, its strategy makes a business model out of the move.\" This week at the London Game Industry Summit, Mr McCary gave presentation on the potential \"cross frontier\" effects of video gaming on other areas of the industry. \"The first thing it does is expose the fact the high-definition screen is a real new frontier, but one that will have great implications around the television industry,\" said Mr McCary, who pointed out a number of other games had been introduced in high-definition just last",

    "This paper explores the critical question in the study of complex dynamics, : 'Under what conditions does an endomorphism of CP^k have a non-trivial Fatou set?' To investigate this problem, we delve into the theory of the dynamics of rational maps and Green's current. The Green function and Green currents, typically associated with potential theory, play a critical role in our analysis. With insights from previous relevant literatures, we propose a novel criterion for the non-triviality of the Fatou set using the linking number of the Green’s current and probe into the deeper structure of the Fatou components. This study advances the understanding of complex dynamical systems by providing robust links between dynamics, topology and potential theory.",
    "This paper presents a novel application of deep learning techniques in the extraction and segmentation of greenhouses from high-resolution optical satellite imagery. Emphasis is laid on the visual understanding and interpretation of these man-made structures that play a significant role in global food production. The study employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as a primary tool to recognize patterns and features in the satellite imagery. The proposed model demonstrates high accuracy and efficiency in identifying greenhouse structures compared to conventional image-based techniques. The results could have important implications for large-scale agricultural operational monitoring and planning, and reserve potential in assessing the spatial distribution of greenhouses at a global scale. The proposed methodology could also facilitate the monitoring of these structures for environmental sustainability purposes.",
    "The Japanese economy grew at its slowest rate in five years from October to December last year, figures from the Cabinet Office have shown.\nAnnual growth came in at 1%, sharply down from 4.6% in the previous quarter and well below forecasts of 2.8%.\nThe latest figures come despite big rises in consumer prices, suggesting weak spending is dragging on growth in Japan.\nThere were also signs the economy is growing at its slowest rate since the 2009 financial crisis.\nThe economy shrank by 2.1% in the fourth quarter of last year and was expanding by only 0.9% on an annual basis in the same period.\nLast month's slump has raised speculation within Japan that the economy could be tipped back into recession.\nThe weak growth comes as a surprise as economists expected growth of 2.8% on the back of a rise in demand for imports, investment and a rise in corporate confidence.\n\"We were surprised by the strength of the decline,\" Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at Nomura, told the BBC.\n\"Most other indicators have been showing a strong uptrend. I think the Cabinet Office was caught in a dilemma – they thought the economy was so strong but then when they actually compiled the GDP, they realised it wasn't.\"\nShirakawa said the main factor behind the slump was weak private consumption.\n\"Personal consumption looks to have been dragged down by weak wage growth and high fuel costs,\" he said.\n\"The strength of the yen and the strong increase in food and fuel prices, and especially oil import prices, dragged on growth,\" Yoichi Moriguchi, an economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, told the Wall Street Journal.\n\"Given the large fall in output, one wonders if that suggests exports have also peaked and that the government is likely to delay a second sales tax hike,\" Shirakawa said.\nEconomists expect further stimulus on top of the 2.4 trillion yen (£15bn; $21.5bn) stimulus package announced last November.\nEconomically, Japan is the world's third-largest economy.\nHowever, its population is shrinking and the country is heavily indebted.\nIt also faces pressure from the rising strength of the yen, which has increased sharply since the central bank made its \"quantitative and qualitative monetary easing",

The paper offers new insights that might shed light on the complexity of these fundamental constructs, thereby providing concrete answers to several open questions in the field.",
    "Retailers will open Christmas stores on Thursday, bringing an end to the long-held tradition of Christmas in November as consumers prepared to buy traditional gifts for loved ones.\n\nThe US Retailers Association (URA), who have the lead role in organizing Christmas in November, have announced that they won't be able to open stores on November 23rd and they want shoppers to take this as a moment to make sure the stores open on Thanksgiving Day instead.\n\nRetailers have asked consumers this winter that, \"For the first time this year, celebrate both Thanksgiving and Christmas in your holiday shopping.\" The Retailers Association and URA agreed on this in January of 2013.\n\nHowever, with retailers reporting weak sales in 2013 and fewer consumers willing to spend on holiday gifts, the retailers are planning on using the first day of November to open their holidays on the 25th.\n\n\"Some of our retailers are open just on the third Friday of November which is usually the busiest shopping day of the year, which we had the unfortunate problem of opening on the wrong day. We don't recommend that you do that,\" URA president and CEO Greg Foran, said.\n\nRetailers have tried to move holiday shopping back to November, but consumers are taking advantage of Thanksgiving in some places and even staying late, even making special trips to the store.\n\n\"Now that we are opening on Thanksgiving we feel that we are taking it back a little bit. But in all fairness to our retailers, we do encourage customers that you shop a lot between Thanksgiving and the end of December in order to maximize your savings this year,\" Mr. Foran stated.\n\nRetailers say that opening on the 25th will save retailers more than $1 billion annually and will help them be more competitive in the holiday shopping season.\n\n\"It's like the old adage; if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck; it probably is a duck,\" said Steven Schoch, executive director of Retail Management and Consultants America.\n\nAt the end of 2013 Christmas sales were the lowest in history. This year is not expected to be any better. According to a report released last week, holiday spending will be just $56 billion, meaning that the lowest holiday in history will likely happen this year.",

    "This study introduces Positional Contrastive Learning (PCL), a novel method for volumetric medical image segmentation. The paper addresses the limitations of current techniques that inadequately exploit spatial context and relationships in 3D biomedical images. The proposed PCL method augments the conventional self-supervised learning by integrating positional cues to strengthen the capacity to capture spatial correlations in volumetric image data. The research utilizes a range of datasets, including MRI and CT scans, verifying that the approach significantly enhances segmentation performance compared to traditional techniques. Further research could focus on exploring how PCL methodology could be expanded to other areas of medical image analysis. The paper’s findings are significant in advancing methods for effective biomedical image segmentation, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and capabilities in healthcare settings.",

    "In this paper, we investigate the search for efficient multi-scale architectures for dense image prediction. Dense image prediction is a critical task in computer vision involving complex values assigned to each pixel in an image. Traditional methods limit their performance efficiency by being bound to a specific scale choice. Our research proposes a new approach that combines architecture search techniques, multi-scale processing, and efficient computation, aiming to enhance the functionality of dense image prediction. The results provided a significant improvement over existing models, establishing a new state-of-the-art for the given task. The practical applications of this research include enhanced scene understanding for autonomous vehicles, robotics, and video surveillance technologies.",
    "Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results on many tasks and datasets. The standard practice for semantic segmentation, however, is still dominated by hand-crafted features and classifiers. Although recent research has explored deep models for semantic segmentation, their efficiency remains a bottleneck. Many solutions involve either overfitting, inefficient architectures, or post-processing. This paper presents a simple dense convolutional network, called DenseNet, for semantic segmentation, which addresses the aforementioned problems. Our model is built on top of a densely connected network. To increase the model capacity, a transition layer, consisting of a 1x1 convolution with a stride of 2x2, is added after each dense block. The number of features remains the same, enabling feature reuse. Moreover, dense blocks are densely connected not only within layers but also across them, enabling the reuse of features during the forward pass. To avoid feature degradation, each layer in the network uses skip connections to transmit features at all spatial resolutions to the following layers. Our architecture provides two main benefits for semantic segmentation: a reduction in parameter redundancy and a significant increase in model capacity. We evaluate our model and its variants on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. As our model is trained on the full resolution images of the PASCAL dataset, we also provide a model trained on ImageNet which has learned features useful for semantic segmentation and which performs comparably to models trained specifically on PASCAL.\n\nThe full text of the paper was published online by NVIDIA's corporate research unit in September 2016. The paper presents the results of a research project called \"Dense Image Classification,\" which studied how to improve image classification tasks using CNNs. The project was supervised by Piotr Dollar and Georg Heigold and was performed by their research assistant, Gonzalo Arbiol, and their student research assistants, Luisa Mendez and Karem Yaroslavskiy. Here's the abstract of the full paper:\n\nMany deep learning systems perform feature extraction through pooling, leading to a large increase in the number of parameters when training more than one classification model. In this paper, we address this problem by reducing the number of parameters of the last layer in deep learning systems. This",
    "\"Global Fukaya category II is a category in category theory, the name denoting a large collection of applications. It describes one particular category — global connectivity, or in other words, connections which can only be expressed through connections at local spaces. It was introduced in 1990 by David A. MacFarlane, which was in turn introduced by David V. D'Amico.\nGlobal Fukaya category II is a connectionist generalization of a local Fukaya category. In connectionist philosophy, the local Fukaya category denotes all connections between abstract worlds. The global Fukaya category denotes the global network of connections.\nThe central idea of global Fukaya category II is that a connection is connected only if it can be decomposed into a set of finite and zero-valued points. Here, the word finite indicates that these points must be elements of some space, which may be finite but not necessarily linear, with finite dimension.\nAs an example, consider the following connectionism:\n(10.8) |X| = |Y| + ( |Z| \\in G)( |\\cdots \\in H(X)| \\in G)\nSuppose the function Y is a fixed point on  X. The set of points of the connection, H(X),  can then be decomposed:\n(10.9) |H(X)| \\geq H(X) \\sum_{i\n\\in H(X)} |i|  X \\mathrm{D} x = N( ( ) \\langle \\textrm{f}(i) \\rangle  |i| \\rangle.\nThis is another way to say that the connection \\(H(X)\\) is local if it is not a hypern on  X and, as Y is a hyperflection of Y, it is local. The set of points of the connection,  |H(X)| \\geq H(X)  x  = N( \\textrm{f}(X) \\cdot \\Lambda \\cdot ( ) \\dots \\Lambda \\ldots ) is the global network of connections between the various infinities.

    "The UK is the manufacturing sector's only significant export destination that still relies upon the EU and it is now widely accepted Europe has a duty to support manufacturing here after decades of neglect.\n\nAnd, as the trade secretary, Liam Fox, declared recently, Brexit will not stop the EU providing its benefits.\n\nAs it stands, the two-year transition which Theresa May set out in her Florence speech and her election manifesto means UK firms will start to trade with the EU once we have left. This week, the government announced there would be a major investment in this sector. They are looking at a \"hard landing\" policy for industrial companies in sectors like automotive, aerospace, and the digital economy in which they cannot expect to be protected for too long.\n\nIn all, there are now 8,000 jobs at risk, mainly in the transport, technology, manufacturing and creative industries. More broadly, jobs around the country are being shifted out of England in favour of countries like South Korea and Taiwan, further weakening the British economy and further fracturing its society.\n\nWe have long known that Brexit would take a toll to our manufacturing industry. Indeed, research from the Institute of Directors and RSM found it would reduce annual GDP growth above and beyond the 1% cut in GDP from Brexit.\n\nBut this week it has become clear there will be a deep impact. The number of manufacturing companies in the UK who are facing the prospect of job losses is steadily increasing.\n\nThere are nearly 1,800 manufacturing businesses on its books who will be affected in the next four years – and that is if the government is able to negotiate a trade deal on the terms it sets.\n\nTo be clear, these numbers include only companies that actually have a plan in place to move their manufacturing overseas. The real figure is likely to be much higher.\n\nThe number of businesses which cannot keep their head offices in the UK is already over half of that. This is of no surprise.\n\nOne in 10 small and medium-sized companies will be unable to keep their production inside the UK following Brexit – and so thousands of jobs will disappear.\n\nTo make matters worse, the UK has been in the EU market for some 80 years despite having no trading relationship with the other 27 nations. The UK's membership of the single market means manufacturers enjoy a level playing field, which our rivals do not.",

    "A construction behemoth has agreed to a multimillion-pound settlement to cover damages caused by exposure to asbestos, marking one of the largest payouts of its kind in history.\n\nThe company, whose identity has been withheld due to ongoing legal proceedings, had reportedly used asbestos, a dangerous and now widely banned building material, in several of its projects up to the 1980s.\n\nAsbestos, if disturbed, can release harmful fibres which can lead to serious diseases like mesothelioma, a form of cancer that primarily affects the lining of the lungs. Thousands of former employees, contractors and clients claimed to have been exposed to the dangerous material.\n\nAfter many years of denial and challenging court proceedings, the building giant has finally capitulated and agreed to a substantial settlement. While the exact figure has not been released, sources close to the case say it would be in the range of several million pounds, setting a new precedent in asbestos-related litigation.\n\n\"This is a momentous day for all those who have suffered due to the company’s negligence and historical use of asbestos,\" stated a lawyer for the plaintiffs. \"Many of our clients have been waiting for this day for years, and hopefully, this settlement will give them some sense of justice.\"\n\nIt is estimated that asbestos has been a contributing factor in over 5000 deaths annually in the UK, with previous occupational exposure primarily in manufacturing and construction industries being a major risk factor.\n\nThis landmark case is expected to pave the way for future claims from those affected by similar negligence.\n\nThe UK started banning the use of asbestos from 1985 and fully prohibited its use, importation, or supply in 1999. However, many buildings constructed prior to these bans may still contain asbestos. Today, asbestos exposure often occurs during refurbishment or demolition works of these older buildings.\n\nThis settlement might send shock waves through the construction industry, potentially triggering similar lawsuits against companies that previously used asbestos. The construction giant will also need to review its prior practices and ensure that all future operations abide by health and safety regulations.\n\nHealth and safety campaigners lauded the settlement as a \"significant victory\", adding that it served as a stark reminder for businesses about the serious consequences of disregarding their obligations towards employee health and safety.\n\nThe unnamed building giant is reportedly considering appealing the settlement, although legal experts have suggested that such an attempt is unlikely to be successful.",

    "After years of financial difficulties, EuroDisney continues to struggle with low visitor numbers and a significant debt burden, yet remains optimistic about an imminent turnaround in its fortunes. \n\nEuroDisney, which operates Disneyland Paris, has been struggling with reduced attendance and mounting debts. France's Disneyland Paris, the most visited tourist attraction in Europe, has faced multiple financial bailouts in recent years due to plummeting visitor numbers, hotel occupancy rates, and consistent financial losses. \n\nHowever, EuroDisney management expressed strong conviction in the theme park's recovery during a recent shareholder meeting. They announced a comprehensive turnaround strategy, which focuses on streamlining operations, reducing costs and capitalizing on the strength of Disney's brand and offerings to restore the company to profitability. \n\n\"EuroDisney's future will be built around solid operations, cost reduction and leveraging Disney's iconic brands to draw more visitors,\" said Michel Roux, CEO of EuroDisney. \n\nThe pledged improvements include refurbishing hotels, enhancing the visitor experience, introducing new popular characters from the Disney universe, and improving the food and beverage offerings based on visitors' preferences. \n\nDespite the parks' fruitful summer season, EuroDisney’s accumulated debt stands at a whopping €1.95 billion. These financial pressures have elicited speculation about whether Disneyland Paris will continue operating in the future.\n\n“In spite of recurring financial stress, we are committed to EuroDisney's future. We genuinely believe we have a healthy recovery strategy in place,” Roux retorted, attempting to dispel any lingering doubts. \n\nDisneyland Paris has been providing an immersive Disney experience to millions of visitors since its inauguration in 1992. As part of its initiative to attract more visitors and increase revenues, EuroDisney also plans to promote Disneyland Paris as a venue for corporate events and concerts. \n\n\"We are taking decisive action that will change EuroDisney’s trajectory,\" Roux said, hinting at the company's determination to once again be at the pinnacle of Europe’s amusement park industry.\n\nAnalysts, however, caution that the proposed turnaround will take time. \"EuroDisney's issues are complex,\" said François Michel, an industry analyst. \"While the proposed turnaround plan is comprehensive, it needs time and continued downward pressure on costs to succeed,\" he added.\n\nEuroDisney's turnaround plans remain a tall order, and it may be quite some time before the reality matches their optimism. One thing is for sure though: the magic of Disney certainly does not leave their management.",
    "This is a terrible movie based on a great game. Although much of the movie is changed to fit the storyline for a movie, the movie deviates from that in all the wrong ways. It's a boring, nonsensical story with a main character that isn't very relatable to the player. The actress, Radha Mitchell, tries hard to make what she's given work but she really could do nothing with it. The main actor, Sean Bean looks the part but it's really too bad they wasted such a talented actor on that script. The actress who plays the main antagonist, Lisa Vidal, is a really good actress and does a wonderful job of scaring the crap out of everyone. Although she's never really featured that much (which I assume due to the fact that she's not very good looking) she still had a big effect on the movie. That effect being the most horrific scenes in the whole movie. If only they would've given more than just a few minutes on her and some back story to the movie, it would have been a lot better for it. However with all the horror and gore, the movie lacks the suspense of the game and it just becomes a run of the mill horror movie. The game is so much scarier simply because you can imagine and experience the horror in your own way. In the game the scariest things aren't seen directly so you create your own personal monster. In the movie everything is shown on screen and in high definition which means you get to see the blood and gore. There is a lot of it but it loses a lot of its effect because it is so direct and visual rather than imagined. The most interesting part of the movie is the actual game itself as a movie. When you see the actual game playing on screen it's amazing. It really makes you feel like you're part of the game. But when it flashes out to the real world it is annoying and out of place. When the game flashes out, it makes everything real, and everything out of place, but the way the game is presented is as if it's all part of the horror movie. It doesn't work well at all. The flash out from a dream to reality is very well done in the movie, so they should have thought the same thing for the game's world. The movie is extremely slow but there are a few good parts. It",

    "Tennis superstar Serena Williams fought through a challenging match to claim her seventh Australian Open title on Sunday.\n\nWilliams, the American legend, faced substantial opposition from her rival Naomi Osaka, the world number three. The win has further solidified Williams' position as one of the greatest players in the realm of tennis, marking her 24th Grand Slam win. The victory comes as another significant addition to her already impressive array of titles.\n\nThe match took place at Rod Laver Arena amid high expectations from eager fans. Williams blazed onto the court, displaying her famous aggressive play style. Osaka, however, refused to be intimidated. She confidently traded blows with the US champion through a tense first set.\n\nDespite Osaka's dogged resistance, Williams eventually emerged triumphant after fierce and rigorous rounds of play. Spectators erupted in applause as she aced the final set, a testament to her relentless determination and resilience.\n\nWilliams went on to address the crowd, expressing her gratitude for their support. \"This win means a lot to me,\" she stated. \"To be able to play at this level at my age is nothing short of a miracle. I'm very grateful for each and every moment.\"\n\nImpressively, this win makes her equal with the long-standing record of 24 major championship singles titles held by all-time great Margaret Court. As such, Williams continues to display her longevity in the sport and the possibility of claiming more victories in the future.\n\nOsaka, although defeated, praised Williams' performance post-match. \"She continues to be a shining example of strength and determination,\" she said. \"Playing against her is always an honour and a challenge.\"\n\nDespite the Australian heat that can pose a considerable challenge in the competition, both players exhibited an outstanding level of athleticism throughout the tournament.

    "\"Dead Poets Society\" is a cinematic masterpiece that profoundly explores the liberating nature of education and the transformative power of literature. Director Peter Weir masterfully crafts a narrative that eloquently showcases the struggle and subsequent rebellion of students against the traditions of an authoritarian and conformist educational institution.\n\nRobin Williams delivers an unparalleled performance as John Keating, a passionate and eccentric English teacher who serves as the catalyst for change. His inspiring declaration, “O Captain! My Captain!” becomes a symbol of defiance, inciting the students to think for themselves and challenge the norms. The supporting cast, including Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard, deliver compelling performances as conformist students turned free-thinking individuals.\n\nThe cinematography is breathtaking — the plush green landscapes and the brick-walled school buildings mirror the dichotomy between freedom and confinement, rigid discipline and creative liberation. The camera beautifully captures the emotions running high in this film, from the ecstatic moments of shared poetry sessions to the haunting contemplative shots of desolation and loss.\n\nThe true power of \"Dead Poets Society\" lies in its narrative subtlety. The film masterfully charts the journey of every major character, giving us glimpses into their personal revolutions — from conformity to individuality. It's a story woven with exceptional sensitivity, brilliantly juxtaposing the invigorating excitement of intellectual discovery with the harsh sting of oppressive tradition.\n\nWhile \"Dead Poets Society\" is profound and emotionally engaging, its true strength rests on its unwavering exploration of timeless themes: passion, creativity, freedom, and the eternal conflict between repression and rebellion. It's a dramatic homage to art and literature, a tribute to the boundless power of the human spirit, and a poignant reminder that, in the midst of societal constraints, our deepest passions should never be suppressed.\n\nIn essence, \"Dead Poets Society\" is more than just a movie — it's a moving piece of literature that breathes life into an age-old struggle for freedom and individuality. It's a film that makes you question, contemplate and, most importantly, seize the day!",

However, the three fathers are very different from each other, with Mike being a stereotypical old-age widower, Mr. Deen being a single-father, and Kevin Bacon being the most successful of the three. All of the three are married, and Mr. Bacon is certainly the odd man out, because unlike the other two, he doesn't have children of his own to play host to. This is another reason why this film feels like a love story in disguise.\n\nThe movie itself has all the makings to be a love story. It begins beautifully with our leads having dinner together, and in the midst of dinner the movie switches to the mother, who is not only younger than her children, but also younger than their father. After dinner, the mother and her daughter are playing in the front yard, while Kevin Bacon and Mr. Deen, as the new fathers, have a lovely conversation. Then they start walking to dinner at a restaurant.\n\nThe movie ends with the three dads (Kevin Bacon, Mr. Deen, and mother) all in bed together, completely satisfied in each other's company. The end of the movie is such a pleasant and well-made film. The film's soundtrack, performed by the aforementioned group of musicians, is actually pretty good. \"Meet the Parents\" was produced by The Weinstein Co., the company of Harvey Weinstein, though some reports put the budget at around $12 million dollars, which is pretty low for a high budget Hollywood film, if you have any expectations of the quality of the film. The film was made under the guidance of David O. Russell and David Slade, both producers of \"Silver Linings Playbook,\" with Russell's brother Robert Weinstein serving as co-",

    "When my dad and granddad decided to buy the small farm in north central Iowa that they shared in the 60s, they were both working, but Dad would go out in the fields all day, while Mom cooked for him. I love that Mom would cook, but I don't think my dad enjoyed it either. So I feel a bit of guilt when he was gone, since he was gone so much. But he wasn't out there to play golf or make beer or watch horse races—he was out there working to support our family. That's why I love Mary, that in a couple of scenes, she lets the guys know she's not in the mood; she was just doing everything she could to make the men happy.\n\nThen she's trying to make a run for it when the two guys are leaving, and she jumps onto them and gives them a kiss. It's really simple—it looks like she's trying to seduce them and then they'll be happy for her. But they are not! They are happy because she showed that she's willing to help, not just get a kiss, but a loving hug. She can't let it come off that way—this is love, for them this will be the last goodbye—so she lets them know she loves them and then she leaves to be home. It's all about that trust factor, and the way that they were not willing to leave her there, and knowing that she would come home to see them.\n\nI loved this movie because it looked like they were really there for each other. That they really enjoyed each other's company and looked for things to do off-camera. They wanted to spend quality time with each other.\n\nI loved that so many people have written to me in the months since we posted an early cut of the film to IMDb.com. Many of you have written to ask about where the film stands, and I've been reading them over and over. I want to address them one by one.\n\nYou can read this review online at IMDB.com and we are going to republish excerpts here in a future newsletter in hopes some of you will come back.\n\n\"Mary and Max\" is a film I loved back when I was a child.

    "\"Elizabeth is a dark fantasy film that is reminiscent of the director Tim Burton's \"Edward Scissorhands\" (2005). Like Burton's film, Elizabeth is set in a Gothic tale where the protagonist is struggling with her past, family, and future. Elizabeth's character is a young woman who finds herself pregnant and unable to take a normal job with a large company. Elizabeth is a woman with power, but she's struggling under it. So she turns to a demon who promises to be her savior. Now, can the demon save Elizabeth enough so that she can raise her son?\"\n\nIMDb rating for \"Elizabeth\"\n\n\"The story of Elizabeth is set during the early 19th century, in a small town in southern Ireland inhabited by farmers living in poverty. The movie is about a woman (played by Mary Morstan, who does a fantastic job in her role) that has become the mistress of a Lord of Illyricum that is involved in the Irish revolution. In the beginning of the movie, Elizabeth is looking for a good husband who will provide her with a decent income. She ends up searching for her father's killer, a man who has gone to the Devil to ask him for the means to resurrect his dead wife. The only thing is that he is already alive and is now known as the \"Black Swan.\" After Elizabeth's husband (played by Brendan Gleeson) is killed by the man, she must then use a combination of magic and steel to put down the supernatural menace plaguing her village. Throughout the movie, an almost religious zeal is shown. As well as being a very interesting character to watch, Elizabeth is a very complex one to portray and the audience really doesn't get the true motives of her character.\n\nAn interesting premise aside, \"Elizabeth\" is a good time watch, much in the same manner as \"Edward Scissorhands\" was an interesting, dark, tale of a man who goes to the Devil for help. As the film progresses, the mood becomes darker and darker and the stakes become higher. In the end, The movie ends with an ending that leaves some questions unanswered, but I definitely enjoyed the journey of Elizabeth, she is a very interesting one, especially in this context, and I enjoyed her quest quite a lot. In spite of her challenges in her personal life, she is a strong character.\n\nSome of the",

    "This movie is funny as hell and is without doubt the greatest comedy that you will see this year, and the best Adam Sandler film so far. The man is a genius. Happy Gilmore, played by Sandler, is an ordinary guy who has never had any success. In the film, he discovers his talent for ice hockey and pursues a career in it. This is the point when the fun starts! The first part of the movie is a collection of outrageous slapstick scenes set in Los Angeles. The first part is very funny and it is a joy to see this young man in action, doing all the usual stunts that we love him for. He becomes obsessed with winning the biggest event in ice hockey, the Gilmore Cup, to become the star of the sport. At first, it seems easy, but then he realises that he needs to make an extraordinary effort to win it. The film gets funnier as it goes. The second part is set in Iceland, and the action continues to escalate, and you will be amazed as you see the final scene of the film. It seems very unlikely at first, but you just have to watch to see what happens next! I have to say that I really appreciated that they kept the first part shorter. It made it much easier to concentrate on the rest of the film. It was really funny and kept your attention. You probably know the rest. So I can really recommend this film, especially if you're a big fan of comedy, or even if you just want to see a good comedy film. I really enjoyed it.\nReview: This film is one of the best comedy films, and the best movie, I have seen this year. There was nothing that would be more exciting. If you like the movie \"Happy Gilmore\" you will enjoy this one. I would also recommend this movie to anyone that likes to go to the theatre. I give this movie a 9/10.\nWednesday, 18 Mar 2020 13:02\nI read this movie just after the original. It's just as good, if not better. I thought that it was a little more entertaining than the original, but it still had the same heart-warming message of the original. I also found the acting much better. I thought that Ben Affleck was the best character in the movie, and his portrayal of a young boy was excellent",

The case has prompted international outcry, emphasizing concerns over freedom of speech and human rights in the Islamic republic.\n\nThe male defendant, whose identity has not been disclosed due to safety concerns, was reportedly found guilty of using his online platform to disseminate anti-establishment propaganda, promoting harmful foreign ideologies, and conducting operations against national security, according to local media outlets. However, human rights experts and international watchdogs have criticized the legitimacy of these charges.\n\nDuring a secret trial with no legal representation present, the blogger was handed down a 10-year sentence for spreading propaganda, with an additional four-year sentence for other security-related charges. The defendant has not been given the opportunity to appeal the court's ruling.\n\n\"No one should be jailed for their peaceful criticism or opinion,\" said an Amnesty International spokesperson, denouncing the sentence. \"This is a flagrant violation of international law, which blatantly disregards the right to freedom of expression.”\n\nThe spokesperson further urged Iran to immediately and unconditionally release the blogger.\n\nThis case adds to increasing evidence of Iran’s harsh crackdown on social media activists and those who openly challenge its ruling authorities, a trend that has drawn sharp criticism from human-rights groups worldwide.\n\nIn Iran, blog writers and social media activists have become an influential voice in the country’s socio-political landscape, often shedding light on issues that are not covered by the country’s strictly controlled state media. Consequently, they have become frequent targets of the Iranian government's clampdowns on freedom of speech.\n\nThe United Nations (UN), Human Rights Watch (HRW), and other international bodies have repeatedly expressed their concerns about Iran's deteriorating record on civil liberties, particularly the freedom of expression and press. \n\nThe detainment and punishing of journalists, writers, and activists is seen by critics as a tactic by the Iranian government to suppress political dissent and maintain its hold on power.",
    "#### User 1\n\nI see the cis male chasers, and then I see someone like me, someone who doesn't chase girls, but genuinely likes one, I see them, but I don't see a difference between them, I just can't see it. I'm not looking, I'm not trying, I'm just not a chaser. I'm just going through life and hoping that I meet someone that I like. Is there something wrong with me or how come I have a hard time finding this difference?\n\n#### User 2\n\nFirst of all, just let me say that *you* can take comfort in knowing you are in a much larger minority than you might think when it comes to liking girls. I can think of a few who are just *like** you*.\n\nSecond, I think a couple of things are different between you and those who are constantly chasing women. Those who are chasing women are acting out what society tells them they should be doing. It is almost like a herd behavior. You can watch a pack of wolves hunt and kill a beast and eat it, but watch the same pack when the prey is fleeing. The wolves chase and chase but are only doing so because it's what the rest of the pack is doing. If the prey is able to evade them, all the wolves will stop chasing and go back to their meal.\n\nThose who choose not to chase are the ones trying something different. This is especially true if they are cisgender people. It's easy to do the opposite in a society that tells you to do it and makes it clear that there are rewards for doing so. It's much harder to rebel against the rest of the herd than to go along with it.\n\nOf course, this is all hypothetical because we are talking about a stereotype here. There might be some who are trying to make it clear that they want no part of being in a heterosexual relationship (a.k.a. being chased), yet they may still be chasing, just in less obvious ways than what you might be used to.\n\n> I used to date a cis male. He was only into me as long as I made the moves. The second I stopped, even if unintentionally, he was gone. He",
    "Hello fellow Fiero enthusiasts!\n\nI am selling my beloved 1988 Pontiac Fiero Formula. I have owned this car for about 5 years now, and it has been an absolute joy to drive. However, I am in need of a larger vehicle now, which leaves me no choice but to part ways with my Fiero.\n\nThe car is mostly stock, with original white paint and grey interior. The upholstery is in pretty good condition considering its age, with minor wear and no major tearing. It has 98k miles on the analog/digital gauge cluster. The heart of the vehicle runs smooth - a 2.8L V6 engine, automatic transmission. Gets great gas mileage. \n\nI would like to highlight some of the maintenance work I have done on this over the years:\n- New brakes \n- Alternator \n- Water pump \n- Full tune-up including spark plugs, wires, cap, rotor \n- Transmission serviced \n- New tires\n\nHere are few things that will need attention: \n- AC does not blow cold, although the heater works fine.\n- Power locks are a bit finicky and need some TLC\n- There is a small oil leak which I have not been able to pinpoint yet\n\nI am asking $5000, but the price can be slightly negotiable for a serious buyer. This is a great little 2-seater sports car for any Fiero enthusiast, or someone looking to start a restoration project. More pictures and information available upon request. Local pick up preferred, but willing to discuss shipping options on a case-by-case basis.\n\nPlease, no lowball offers and serious inquiries only. Feel free to DM me with any questions or if you want to check out the car in person. \n\nThank you for looking, Fiero community!",
    "_In most high-status colleges it is illegal to refuse admission based on race. It is illegal to favor minorities for admission based on race. However, in the UC admissions system: \"California law states that UC cannot give preference and/or disadvantage to a specific applicant based on his/her age, marital or parental status, color, sex, national origin (including country of origin), social class, race, ethnic group identification, religious creed or religious affiliation.\" However, this is only for admissions, it is not illegal to discriminate against students on these same factors when it comes to academic standards, financial aid packages, and so forth. This, of course, leads to minority students being forced to conform to what white professors consider to be \"merit-based,\" while whites are given a more lenient standard and more financial aid, simply because their race is white. A system that is legal on paper but illegal in practice._\n\n_It's an issue of law and human rights. The law should prevent discrimination based on race but permit discrimination based on merit regardless of race. Furthermore, it is unconstitutional and in violation of human rights to force any person to change their race in order to enter an institution, and the law should penalize individuals and institutions that refuse to admit people regardless of their race. It's the 21st century—there should be no reason for these blatant injustices to continue. What do you think?_\n\nA response from the subreddit that I agreed with a lot was the following:\n\n_That doesn't even make sense. The system you describe is more effective for affirmative action, not more effective after affirmative action. The people who got in as a result of affirmative action will have the same academic standards and expectations as everyone else. People who got in based on academic standards might not get as much financial aid as people who got in based on affirmative action._\n\nAs you see in this example, people disagree on whether or not racial preferences should be illegal. The question that this subreddit has in mind is whether or not race can be a legitimate criterion for admittance to college or should only merit matter in the decisions of admissions officers. There are also many philosophical and logical problems with how the poster has framed the legal question. This post demonstrates the challenge of coming to a consensus",
    "The temperature limit for RAM can be a bit tricky to define, as it generally fluctuates based on the exact model in use. However, modern DDR4 RAM modules have a standard operating temperature range of 0°C to 85°C. They can function slightly above this range, but it is not recommended due to potential performance lags and lifespan reduction. \n\nBefore worrying about your RAM becoming too hot, bear in mind that it's usually not the component that tends to generate a significant amount of heat compared to others like your CPU and GPU. RAM modules have minimal power draw and hence, the generated heat is usually minimal as well. \n\nThat being said, in a fan-cooled PC when gaming, the temperature of RAM would typically sit around 30-45°C, given that your PC has proper air flow. This can vary depending upon the heat generated by nearby components as well.\n\nIt's essential to keep a check on your system's temperatures. Couple of software tools which help in doing so include HWMonitor and Speccy. Keep in mind, though, that unless your system has faulty cooling or you’re overclocking your hardware, your RAM generally shouldn’t be getting hot enough to cause any issues.\n\nStay cool and game on!",

    "Apparent multifractality: The apparent multimodality of L\\(N\\)-self-similar neural networks In this work, we study the ability of neural networks to form similar networks. In this way, we address problems in the theory of the neural networks that have been commonly proposed by those who make a major contribution to machine learning. We perform an experiment that explicitly shows the lack of a multimodality in the network of neural networks trained on two training sets, the first with a fixed number of elements, and the second with a variable number of elements. We obtain an increase of the number of clusters in the largest of the clusters by an amount proportional to the number of elements in the first set (by a factor of 2 in our experiment, when we allow a constant proportion of elements). The apparent multimodality does not imply a theoretical necessity that we call the \"Bubble Hypothesis\", since it does not make clear why we obtained the increase in size in the network with increasing number of clusters. We also present experimental results that clearly demonstrate that the increase of the number of clusters in the network with increasing number of elements is due to a nonlinearity, so that there is no increase in the maximum length of the network. Our results establish that there is non-parametric scaling in the L\\(N\\)-network of neural networks whose apparent multifractality and parametric scaling have been demonstrated in prior work.",

In this paper we show the quantum computer's operation does not depend on whether or not it is described by quantum mechanics. We show that a system which is not described by quantum mechanics can be engineered to operate as a quantum computer, provided it is designed to exploit the properties which exist in the laws of physics which underlie the dynamics of most systems, in particular energy degradation.\nA computer which requires energy degradation to function can be said to naturally utilize this property of its environment to realize its purpose. This type of computer is therefore nonphysical.

    "\"An American woman travels to Ireland to attend her best friend's funeral. Once there, she makes a shocking discovery about her dearly departed.\"\n\"This movie is set in Los Angeles but was shot mostly in Ireland. The first scene is of Gerry (Gerard Butler) at his wife's funeral. He doesn't like to read the eulogy so he reads from a CD that Holly wrote for him. (The real reason is revealed later) Holly (Hilary Swank) was a woman who loved to live life and spread happiness around her. After the funeral, Holly's friends find Holly's notebook, which she wrote to Gerry to open after her death, along with the enclosed CD of how to be in a relationship and some other little things. She mentions that Gerry will love her forever and always. One of her best friends is Holly's boss, Aisling (Lisa Kudrow) who makes a lot of noise at the funeral and tries to hold Gerry accountable for her friends early death by giving cancer a really bad name. Holly had planned to move to Ireland. The movie is mainly about the grief these people go through as she never had an illness or didn't smoke or drink or take drugs or anything. She wasn't overweight and she didn't hang out with smokers who would give her second hand smoke. You have never seen Hilary Swank so fat. In the movie you see him at his fattest around the house in his pajamas and his hair is falling out from chemo. All the girls in her book club (in L.A.) dress in all white, as was Holly's fashion, when they read excerpts from Holly's notebook. Then you have some Irish gangster who tries to kill Butler after Gerry accidentally pushes him off a bar stool on another attempt to get rid of the gangster he has been tailing. In the end they all end up in Ireland. He goes to Ireland and falls in love with her all over again and goes back thinking she was an angel. This movie had so much potential. Hilary Swank is such a great actress and a great body was a waste. It reminded me of \"Bridget Jones's Diary\". The dialogue is a little cheesy at times and she had the weirdest friends.

    "For the first time in decades, the original Exorcist film is set to be screened across select cinemas in the UK. The critically acclaimed, ground-breaking horror masterpiece returns to the big screen this October, providing modern audiences with an opportunity to experience one of cinema’s most chilling offerings in its full glory.\n\nThe 1973 horror film, directed by William Friedkin and based on the 1971 novel of the same name by William Peter Blatty, continues to stand tall as a titan of the horror genre. \n\nThe Exorcist tells the haunting tale of a young girl, Regan, played by Linda Blair, who becomes possessed by a demonic entity. The iconic performance of Max Von Sydow as Father Merrin, the titular exorcist, and Ellen Burstyn as the desperate mother, makes their attempts to free Regan from her terrifying ordeal a grimly compelling experience.\n\nThe film's original release created a wave of hysteria, with reports of fainting, nightmares, and even cases of reported 'possession' in cinema-goers. This, combined with the film's startling special effects and eerie soundtrack, cemented its place as a cultural phenomenon and led to it being dubbed one of the scariest films ever made.\n\nDespite the controversy, or perhaps in part because of it, The Exorcist was a commercial triumph. It won two Academy Awards, for best sound and best-adapted screenplay, and was nominated for another eight, including best picture, a rarity for a horror film.\n\nThis re-release provides both lovers of classic cinema and thrill-seekers with an opportunity to revisit the disturbing tale as it was intended, on the big screen. Furthermore, the re-release will give younger audiences who've only heard of its notorious reputation the chance to visually experience the gripping movie.\n\n“Viewers should brace themselves for an intense cinematic experience,” says Michael Rourke, manager at one of the participating cinemas. “Whether you’re a fan of horror or a cinephile interested in influential classics, The Exorcist is a must-see.”\n\nAudiences are advised to book their tickets early to avoid disappointment, as the screenings are expected to sell out rapidly due to the film’s enduring popularity. Get ready to experience once again the chilling power of this classic which remains as shocking and powerful as it did when it first terrorized screens nearly five decades ago.\n",

    "A new cyber threat named the 'FBI virus' has surfaced and cybersecurity experts are urging computer users to remain cautious. This rogue virus disguises itself as a warning from the Federal Bureau of Investigation by using the agency's logos and credentials, tricking uninformed users into thinking their computer's IP address has been linked to illegal online activities.\n\nThe details of this deceptive scheme were uncovered by a group of cybersecurity researchers. They have warned that this particular ransomware is capable of locking out users from their devices, then demanding payment in the form of a fine to regain access. The definitive characteristic of this cyber attack involves a fake alert claiming that the victim’s Internet Protocol (IP) address has been implicated in child pornography or other illegal activities. The malicious software advises the users to pay a 'fine' to the FBI to avoid prosecution.\n\nDespite appearing legitimate, computer users are advised that the actual Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) would never directly contact individuals in this manner. The FBI also never requests personal details via email nor makes threats or demands for payment in this way.\n\nCybersecurity officials have warned that opening suspicious emails or clicking on unfamiliar links can cause one's device to become infected.

    "Link\nCrossrail, a railway connecting east and west London and beyond, will be approved this week, a BBC investigation suggests. The cross-London railway had been rejected twice before, but the transport secretary will give it the go-ahead once he returns from the US where he is meeting fellow world leaders.\nTransport Minister Norman Baker, said he would announce a final decision to London's mayor Boris Johnson, once the details of the scheme and cost had been agreed.\nThe high-speed link would run some 60 miles, from west London to east London with four branches – one to Stratford, one to Whitechapel, one to Old Oak Common to the north west and one to Abbey Wood on the south east side of the capital.\nIt would have 33 stations, running under both the Thames and beneath a number of existing tube lines.\nHowever, costs are expected to rocket beyond the £14.8bn price tag put on the scheme by its last private sector backer in November last year, as the company dropped out due to doubts about its future viability.\nLast week, Mr Johnson said: \"I just don't know where the money's going to come from and I think that's a very serious issue.\"\nMr Baker said he hoped the \"financially-motivated delay\" by TfL would not drag on any longer.\nIt is understood that Transport for London (TfL) will be required to help make up the shortfall, though the majority of the money will most likely come from taxpayers, through the Department for Transport.\nTfL's budget is to be severely cut by the government in April 2013 in order to provide some funding for London's cash-strapped NHS.

    "\"Sweet and Lowdown\" is an exquisite entry dialogue on the artistry, eccentricity, and intertwined complexity of music and life, presented through the keen and delightful lens of the acclaimed auteur, Woody Allen. In his homage to the jazz era, Allen introduces an incredibly complex character in the form of Emmet Ray (played by Sean Penn), a man who embodies both the brilliance of an artist and the self-destructive tendencies of a flawed human. \n\nReminiscent of his previous works, \"Sweet and Lowdown\" masterfully translates Allen's signature style of smart, witty, dark humor and profound existential discourse onto the film's 1930s canvas. The film cleverly blends fiction with authenticity through the inclusion of pseudo-documentary elements, which add a layer of compelling depth to the storyline.\n\nSean Penn’s standout performance as a brilliant, yet deeply flawed jazz guitarist is worth every accolade it's received and then some more. His portrayal of Emmet Ray seems almost effortless and his sheer talent does absolute justice to the complexities of the character, making him fascinatingly watchable despite his negative traits. Samantha Morton, with her virtually mute role as Hattie, showcases extraordinary acting restraint with her heart-wrenchingly genuine performance, communicated through her expressive eyes and body language.\n\nThe jazz-heavy soundtrack subtly yet persuasively anchors the film's emotional depth, enhancing our understanding of Ray's internal struggles. It is the sheer magic of music that conveys the core essence of the narrative, connecting us to Ray's world.\n\n\"Sweet and Lowdown\" explores love, ambition, regret, the fickleness of fame and the tormented soul of an artist with a raw sensitivity that will leave you both amused and introspective. If you're an ardent fan of Woody Allen's distinct narrative style, this film is an absolute must-watch. Most importantly, it is a glorious tribute to the timeless beauty and transformative power of music.",
    "I've recently come across 2ce (a psychedelic drug similar to LSD and psilocyptomycin) and I have a couple of questions for those who have experience with it. No, I am not thinking of trying it myself, rather a friend of mine has mentioned using it and I want to better understand what he might be getting into.\n\n1. What is the typical dosage and how does it compare to other hallucinogens like LSD or magic mushrooms in terms of strength and duration?\n\n2. How intense are the visuals? Is it more of a mind trip or is there also a significant sensory aspect like with LSD?\n\n3. Can you describe the headspace? A lot of LSD users talk about the introspective nature and insight they gain, can the same be said about 2ce?\n\n4. How common are bad trips and what can be done to prevent them or deal with them if they do occur?\n\n5. Lastly, are there any long term health implications that are known? Bad comedowns or neurotoxicity like MDMA?\n\nI'm slightly worried about my friend, as he tends to jump into these things without much research. Any insight would be greatly appreciated so I can provide him with some facts and perhaps a bit of caution. Thank you!",
    "I had the privilege of watching \"How to Train Your Dragon\" with modest expectations and was delightfully surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The film unfolds not only as a dazzling, fast-paced animation feast but also as a story embedded with tenderness, heart, and lessons of understanding, courage and friendship.\n\nThis DreamWorks animation takes you into the visually stunning Viking world, where a young Viking, Hiccup, aspires to follow the village tradition by becoming a dragon slayer. The turn of events that leads to Hiccup finding, befriending, and ultimately training a dragon named Toothless is beautifully depicted, breaking stereotypes and enhancing the adventure quotient significantly.\n\nThe animation quality of the film is exceptional. The detailed character designs, towering landscapes, and aerial cinematography truly stand apart. The flying sequences, in particular, are absolutely breathtaking, offering viewers the exhilarating rush of soaring through the wide-open sky.\n\nVoice casting is spot-on, with Jay Baruchel infusing Hiccup with an irresistible blend of underdog vulnerability and adolescent wryness. America Ferrera, Gerard Butler, and Craig Ferguson lend strong voice support, fleshing out their roles with depth and personality.\n\nWhat really touched me about \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is the heartwarming bond between Hiccup and Toothless. Despite their natural roles as mortal enemies, they build a transcending camaraderie, shifting the narrative into a commentary on acceptance, understanding, and breaking the chains of the status quo.\n\nWhile the movie is packed with suspense and action, it also expertly balances humor and emotion. The story arc of Hiccup, from being an unfavored, awkward teen to the hero of his village, is not just entertaining but incredibly inspiring, resonating with audiences of all age groups.\n\nIn conclusion, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is an ingenious blend of heart, humor, and action, wrapped up in stunning visuals. It stands tall not just as an action-packed adventure, but also an emotionally nuanced journey, making it a compelling watch for both children and adults. A franchise that will effortlessly find its place in the annals of animated classics.",
    "I've been playing this game for quite a while now and something that's been niggling at the back of my mind is how overpowered the drinking need zones seem to be. I mean, one would think that finding where animals congregate to drink would naturally give an advantage, but the extent to which it does seem a bit much. \n\nI've found that merely by staking out one or two need zones, I can pick off a wide variety of game with almost no real effort. This advantage has made the bulk of my hunting games seem more like a waiting game rather than an immersive hunting experience. Not to mention, this seems like a complete departure from what hunting should be - tracking and trailing your game, using your wits to outsmart it.\n\nOn the other hand, I can see how this could add an interesting strategic element to the game. Figuring out these spots and knowing when to use them could be part of mastering the game, and I know that there are some scenarios where animals become wary of these zones if there's too much hunting pressure. \n\nOn the whole though, it feels like drinking need zones are just a 'cheat code'. I wanted to know what everyone else thought about this. Do you think the devs need to nerf the drinking need zones in future updates or am I just imagining things? How does this affect your gaming experience? Would love to hear your thoughts!",
    "\"Ender's Game looks like a children's game but in fact it is an adult film with some fascinating and relevant themes. The movie is beautifully made and extremely entertaining despite its simple plot. If you don't mind fantasy then it will satisfy and if you look for interesting movies without sci-fi twists, you might find it. And for those who dislike war movies it will satisfy. And just remember, Ender Wiggin has survived a death sentence during the invasion of his planet and is the greatest hero ever. Although the \"human\" parts of the movie do not give the proper explanation to the whole 'Battle for Earth', it is worth the effort of watching the movie and reading on the 'back story'.\n\nThis is a very well presented movie with good pacing but there's no depth in the plot. As a child, I found this movie interesting but as an adult the movie could have given the appropriate explanation. However, this movie is not as a good as \"Warcraft\" because Ender Wiggin is not the main protagonist of the movie but rather the supporting character. Even \"The Hobbit\" in my opinion is an excellent movie because of all the important characters and plotlines. \"Ender's Game\" is not a perfect movie because of its simplicity but it is a worthy film.\"\n\n\nI think the movie \"Ender's Game\" is one of the most interesting and well-presented movies of the week, and I recommend it to you.\n\nBest wishes!\n\n\nIMDb.com Rating: 8.7\n\n1.2K Shares\n\n\nEnjoy our posts?

    "Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie has spoken out against plans to change the rules on second homes that will allow first-home buyers to buy a second home tax free for three years.\n\nHe said there was a \"clear conflict\" between the need to promote affordable housing in Scotland and the current tax arrangements which let homebuyers under 30 avoid paying any property tax while buying second homes up to £600,000.\n\nMurray is \"the last, and most senior\" Scottish Liberal Democrat MP and may struggle to rally support for the plan if it appears to be a gift to the SNP, he said.\n\nThe SNP has also indicated it is likely to pursue the policy, although it has not gone far enough, Rennie added.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon plans to hold a consultative round table and will also consult other parties on the issue.\n\nRennie said: \"I do not support the changes announced by the Scottish Government. They take a wrong turn, and do nothing of substance to promote affordable housing in Scotland. This is a clear conflict between the need to promote affordable and socially responsible housing in Scotland, and the ongoing benefits to first-home buyers of the current tax rules.\"\n\n\"The proposed system would be a gift to the SNP, giving them further political cover by giving them the same sort of extra cash.\"\n\nHe added: \"The SNP government has not even suggested a time frame for the proposed changes to the tax treatment of second homes. Without this, their proposals cannot be seen as anything other than a gift to the party's supporters.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Sturgeon said there was \"strong evidence\" the current tax laws were damaging not just the rental market but the wider housing market including home ownership for young people.\n\nShe said evidence showed more than one in 20 Scottish households renting privately, and more than two thirds of Scottish families buying their own home were under 35.\n\nA government consultation on changing the rules on second homes is due to close on Wednesday.",
    "A few days ago my mother of 70, died. She worked as a nurse at one of these hospitals she hated. She was a nice, kind, caring person and I'm so disappointed by how she was treated. You all are always praising people who are helping you from life. Myself, being a single parent, this is completely unacceptable to me as it comes across as self interest. We have a lovely home. I'm a writer and I'm trying to find a way of providing income for my son. My mum worked hard and it's nice that she had her pension. She never took any days off. She died and no one even asked about why. What I am trying to do is make a living for my own family so they can pay the rent and I can take a day off as well. I'm an unemployed single mum who worked hard to give me a better life and now my daughter is asking me to stay home. How can this be acceptable? My own mother is now in a better place. She got her pension. She is at peace. How can I be so selfish and heartless that I don't ask her to give my son a break for the sake of his own life? For every single day, not a single dollar that I earn, not a single penny that I put in savings, every single day of my life I've put my heart, soul and focus into making sure my son has a better life than me. So even though I know I'm entitled to ask her for my own son's life I don't ask for nothing? The whole situation is just wrong.\n\nShe is certainly not alone in this situation.\n\nA few days ago I was approached, at the age of 56, by a woman who told me that she, too, had just finished her work as a nurse and went to a private nursing home.\n\n\"I'd heard about your post on reddit,\" she told me. \"It must be you.

I could have done that.\"\n\nWe were talking about her mother's death and how she didn't want the same thing to happen to me.\n\nShe said, \"Your mother wouldn't be alive if you'd just asked her to let you stay home with her.

    "US'suffers' with awards fatigue\n\nAfter a year of unprecedented success, American awards are suffering a 'breakdown', according to the LA Times.\n\nFollowing more than 80 nominations with a share of more than half the total, the industry is feeling the after effects of \" awards fatigue\", according to this week's Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn fact, so many nominations have been announced – and so many winners have been announced – that the awards can't even make sure that they have all the names correct on their ballots.\n\nThe lack of nominations has led a number of high profile film awards, including the best director and best adapted screenplay for Kathryn Bigelow and Robert De Niro, to be voted upon by voters around the world. But the LA Times' Jonathan Maus reports that although many awards \"applause\" for this year's nominees, a number of them feel unimpressed. \"More than a decade after the first Oscars, the country faces a wave of fatigue as dozens of film gurus and top film financiers gather for the 72nd film industry celebration on Hollywood Boulevard,\" the story says.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times goes on to explain that the industry is seeing \"tensions between Hollywood and awards watchers\" as \"the nominees don't really stand up.\"\n\nThey also suggest that the \"overwhelming success of the last several decades of awards season may have turned it into the equivalent of a high school track meet. \"The nominees must have the same winning formula. Their movies must also be nominated in every category at every film festival. And the winners must have a strong performance at other awards shows.\"\n\nHowever, some argue that the industry needs to be open to new ideas and to different points of view, and there have been no major surprises yet: both Kathryn Bigelow's film The Hurt Locker and Dinesh D'Souza's film 2012 garnered the same amount of awards recognition – and each have received the prize for best picture.\n\nDinesh D'Souza, the director and author, told the magazine that he thought that if an American artist could win an award for something of his choosing in the same year as it was nominated for at film festivals, America might change its mind.\n\nHowever, he added that he doubted that American awards, \"the main source of",
    "A look at Newcastle United's preparations for tonight's FA Cup fourth round tie against Southampton – a match in which Sam Allardyce's side will be without their top scorer Emmanuel Riviere, the club have added a midfielder, goalkeeper Julio Cesar and a striker to their squad.\n\n\nNewcastle are looking to go a step further when they host Southampton in the third round of the FA Cup. Having made four changes to the side that suffered a 2-1 loss at Arsenal, manager Sam Allardyce has made several further changes to the starting 11 – with midfielder Steve Harper, goalkeeper Julio Cesar and forwards Papiss Cisse and Papiss Demba Cazorla all starting at St. James' Park.\n\n\nSouthampton have only lost one game at St. Mary's this season – an 3-1 defeat at Chelsea – whilst Newcastle have lost just one of their last 15 trips there – the 3-1 humiliation to Bayern Munich in the group stages. And while Allardyce said he was not happy with yesterday's performance at the Emirates, his side will be desperate to avoid a second consecutive failure in the competition.\n\n\nThe Geordie manager has no shortage of injury questions to answer. Newcastle have only one recognised senior midfielder available – Ayoze Perez. The Spaniard did not travel with the squad to London. And while winger Loic Remy was included in Allardyce's 19-man squad, the Frenchman is yet to make his Newcastle debut – his last appearance was in 2013, when he scored the equalizing goal in the 2-1 defeat at Blackburn Rovers.\n\n\nAnd with the team's top scorer Riviere absent, Newcastle's options in attack have been cut in half. Cesar, a former Barcelona reserve player, has been preferred to Demba Cazorla following a successful loan spell at QPR last season.\n\n\nDespite having five recognised centre-halves in the squad, Allardyce could use a left-back. The former West Ham manager opted for Matt Ritchie against Arsenal, but after starting each of the last five league games he was dropped for Sunday's game against Bayern Munich.\n\n\nMidfielder Steve Harper, a loanee from Stoke City, has been a regular fixture in Allardyce's backline during the current campaign. Despite playing in midfield, Harper is still a left-back, and while the 27",
    "A new survey has revealed that Angels by Robbie Williams is the nation's favourite send-off song at funerals. The perennial pop hit which was first released in 1997, has surpassed traditional hymns and classics to become the most commonly played tune at the farewell services across the UK. \n\nMusic and comedy website, TickX, compiled the list of Britain’s favourite funeral songs, analysing thousands of public playlists on streaming services to compile the data. Robbie Williams' melancholic ballad topped the chart followed by Frank Sinatra's 'My Way' and Louis Armstrong's 'Wonderful World'.\n\nJohn Smith, CEO of TickX, says the trend reflects a significant cultural shift in attitudes towards funerals. He said, \"Unlike previous generations who tended to prefer hymns and classical music, we’re seeing a significant shift towards pop music and even rock at funerals. It seems that people increasingly view funerals as a celebration of life and gravitate towards songs that were favourites of the departed or carry a special sentimental value.\"\n\n\"It seems fitting that 'Angels', a song that so many Brits have grown up with, has topped the list. Its lyrics can be interpreted as an uplifting message of guardianship and care,\" he added.\n\nThe song, penned by Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers, was not originally received well by critics. However, it went on to become one of the most famous songs ever to come out of the Britpop Era, and Williams' signature hit. It peaked at number four on UK Singles Chart but spent over three months in the top ten. \n\n\"We are living in interesting times and our music choices are reflecting that,\" says Clare Davis, a funeral celebrant in London. \"People are selecting songs that mirror their loved ones' personalities, interests and the memories that meant the most to them – they’re making funerals personal and reflective, and a time to remember and smile amidst the sorrow.\"\n\nWhile 'Angels' topped the list of pop songs, traditional songs and hymns are far from forgotten. 'Amazing Grace' and 'Abide with Me' were still in the top ten, reflecting the endurance of these age-old classics.\n\nFunerals are deep-rooted in tradition but as this survey suggests, they are also evolving to incorporate contemporary tastes and sensibilities. The rise of songs like 'Angels' pointing towards an emerging trend for funerals to be a more personalised celebration of a loved one’s life.",
    "British Telecom (BT) has unveiled a landmark offer to provide free internet phone calls to its broadband customers, marking a significant shift in the telecoms market. This move intends to capitalise on the rapidly-growing Internet Telephony or VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) market.\n\nThe service, known as BT VOIP, will not charge customers for calls made to UK landline numbers at weekends and during evenings. BT’s decision is expected to position it favourably in an intensely competitive sector. \n\nBT has reportedly said that its broadband customers will still need to pay line rental, but stressed that packages offer much more compared to traditional telephone services.\n\n\"BT is committed to providing the best and most convenient communications solutions to our customers. The new VOIP service will allow users to make calls directly through their broadband connection, assuring crystal-clear voice quality,\" said a spokesman for BT. \n\nThis offer is seen as a strategic move by BT to retain its existing customers and attract new ones in a landscape driven by bundled broadband and TV deals. With many providers offering diverse internet services and broadband deals, BT's offer aims to provide added value to its broadband services.\n\nAnalysts are already suggesting that this move signifies a significant shift in the UK telecoms market, with the internet increasingly becoming the primary platform for voice communication. It reflects the changing consumer behaviour and the rise of digital communication channels.\n\nWhile BT has made strides in providing free internet phone calls, there might be a catch. Customers will continue to incur charges for calls made to mobile networks and international numbers outside of the inclusive call times. However, users are likely to benefit from lower charges compared to traditional landline rates. \n\nThe new VOIP service could also spell the advent of increased internet traffic. As more customers switch over to internet telephony, companies like BT can leverage the opportunity to roll out wider and more comprehensive data plans. \n\nIn conclusion, although BT's decision to offer free net phone calls might seem like a win-win situation for customers, it is expected to intensify competition among rival telecoms providers. How these changes will evolve the market landscape and consumer behaviours remain to be seen.",
    "\"The Birth of a Nation\", while acknowledged as a pioneering work in American cinematic history, is firmly rooted in a disturbing and polarizing perspective. Directed by the infamous D.W. Griffith, the film was a breakthrough in terms of technical wizardry, innovative film editing techniques, and use of grand spectacle; however, it remains largely controversial due its glaring endorsement of racism, glorification of the Ku Klux Klan and its violent, historical distortions of post-Civil War America.\n\nBeyond its technical prowess, the movie exemplifies early Hollywood's narrative power, featuring sweeping battle scenes, dramatic tension, and tragic love stories that keep the audience engaged from start to finish. From a purely cinematic standpoint, \"The Birth of a Nation\" was the first epic film, setting the groundwork for future important productions, and this cannot be ignored.\n\nHowever, the film's blatant racism proves a chilling viewing experience. By portraying heinous stereotypes of African Americans and glorifying the actions of the Ku Klux Klan, it primarily fuels racial hatred rather than depicting an accurate historical account. While it is understood that this movie is a product of its time, and it must be interpreted within its historical context, it's hard to stomach the extent of its racial distortion.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Birth of a Nation\" is an unavoidable landmark in the history of American cinema. Its technical and narrative breakthroughs remain impressive and were key to the further development of the film industry. Simultaneously, its misguided and harmful racial portrayals serve as somber examples of the virulent racism that permeated early 20th-century America. I would recommend viewing this film as an educational experience, a historical document of cinema and its cultural influence, though certainly not as an agent of racial or moral education.",
    "Current state-of-the-art approaches for few-shot image segmentation rely either on large external datasets or a meta-learner for the adaptation of the model to the target domain. However, acquiring large volumes of data for every new domain in medical imaging is costly while the meta-learners are also data hungry. We present a novel concept that leverages existing segmentation methods without the need for large amounts of data or a meta-learner. We use the global correlation between the object and the background together with the object shape prior. We demonstrate the proposed concept on the cardiac and pelvic segmentation datasets. Our experiments on three different networks show that the proposed concept can improve the overall performance even for state-of-the-art networks. We demonstrate that our concept provides the following benefits: improves training speed by up to 50%, increases segmentation accuracy with up to 40% on 3D data and achieves a 2.2 - 4.3 times lower computational cost than state-of-the-art meta-learners. We also show that our approach is robust to both the number of training images and the type of backbone network.\nAn article in Computer Vision Zone, June 22, 2021, explains the research paper from arxiv.org. The following is a quotation from the article that summarizes some of the key benefits of the research paper:\nUsing the global correlation and the shape prior for few-shot medical Image segmentation improves the overall performance. This concept does not require meta-learners and therefore large training datasets with the same domain. This leads to a reduction of computational effort and saves training time.\nI wrote the following comment on the Computer Vision Zone article:\nThe fact that you state in this article there are four key benefits to using the global correlation and shape prior for few-shot medical image segmentation and using the meta-learners does not require large training datasets that are the same domain should be made perfectly clear in a title for any press release that is intended to inform the reader quickly. As currently written in the article, I think, there will be readers who miss the key benefits of the research paper and are only focused on using the meta-learners does not require large training datasets that are the same domain.\nI was happy to be the recipient of the research paper that I received as it is definitely",

    "An explosion of oil prices to record highs has hit already strapped economies and has pushed some developing countries close to bankruptcy.\nThe West's appetite for energy, fuelled by rising prosperity and consumption, and a rapid expansion in China and India, has put increasing pressure on resources.\nIn just three months oil prices have tripled since late October.\nThat is equivalent to a $10 (£5.35) gallon [of gasoline] at the pump in America, about the same amount that it costs to buy a liter of crude oil.\nMany people, like my friends and colleagues here at Columbia University, have responded to these record-high oil prices — along with the dramatic drop in the value of the U.S. dollar over the last year — by predicting that the prices have topped out and are soon to fall again, for a variety of reasons. Others expect that the skyrocketing prices will drive future scientific advancements and the development of new energy sources. Still others have argued that the prices are an indication of the future cost of energy, and are preparing for that future. But those who dismiss the skyrocketing oil prices or attribute them to some other cause may be ignoring crucial aspects of the situation.\nThe unprecedented rise in oil prices, if it continues, will likely lead to a profound economic restructuring and a long-lasting drop in living standards in the United States and other Western industrial countries: a massive economic contraction, a huge reduction in the value of financial assets such as stocks and bonds, and a large deterioration in the quality of life for a large portion of the population of the United States. Moreover, and more importantly, the rise in oil prices will likely be associated with a substantial deterioration in the conditions of developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. As I have argued in a recent paper that has just been published in Harvard's journal of law and economics The Review of Law and Economics, the rise in oil prices to record levels was largely caused by the dramatic reduction in supply — not the unprecedented rise in demand — and will likely be sustained for at least 15 years or more, creating an enormous threat to the quality of life of millions of people around the world.\nThe following is the full text of my paper:\nThe World Economy: Oil Prices and Their Consequences\nby Daniel W.

    "Just received my truck and the last 30 days of the lease have been full of maintenance.\n\nEverything is in such a state. I just turned the air conditioner off and left it on for the remainder of the day as the temperature fluctuates wildly. I'm now waiting for this truck's transmission to be changed since it is having a hard time starting. I've done research and found that a lot of these issues have been happening since the warranty ended and they are not covered under warranty..and after my truck sat in my driveway for a month I now have to get to work on time.\n\nWhen I go to work on the truck the transmission just won’t shift..so I go to work like a madman and can’t even start the car. My coworkers who have trucks have said they have to put gas in but can’t start the car while putting gas in.\n\nI just thought I had one of the issues, my truck was the second one they had put into the lot at this dealership. Now that I've gone through the entire ordeal, I would never rent a truck from this dealership again! I would call them but I have no service number other than the owner's number on their website. I have sent one email to let them know I'm going to send a complaint but I haven’t heard back from them. I'm also looking for the owner to get back to me and get this matter settled so I don’t end up with a lemon truck that won’t run (yes, the truck is in fact in my driveway).",
    "Dear tenants,\n\nI recently moved to a rental house, and I was given a one-month eviction notice. My former landlord left three months pay on the place, he said he would fix my room when I moved out, but he hasn't done anything. He refuses to fix my bed, my kitchen, the bathroom or the stove, and when I asked him if he would do this, he said he was \"trying\". I'm worried that he won't, or that he is still planning to move out. I also moved into this house just yesterday, it has been 2 months. I'm worried that we're going to be broke for sure if I do not do this. He's been calling me nonstop, threatening violence if I'm not paid tomorrow, demanding that I not answer his doorbell, and threatening that he's going to throw gas on me if I just give him another week. He's also kept sending messages on my phone, threatening and telling me to get out of my new house.\n\nHe's threatening to bring me to jail or kill my dog. He's saying that I will never get an apartment in L.A. If you would like to discuss this, please use Private Message on Reddit.\n\nRegards,\n\n[Redacted]\n\nThe Reddit user asked if the landlord could pay in full, or if the owner owed rent. The posting also asked what other options existed.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Rent Board website provides an online form where tenants can request temporary permission to live at a former landlord's property before they are evicted.\n\nThe L.A. County Rent Board website lists a tenant who signed a lease under this state law.\n\nIn the online form:\n\nA landlord may ask you to sign a written lease for a period of not more than one year if you have been a tenant of that landlord for at least one year or you have been a resident there for less than one year before your eviction. Unless a landlord's lease agreement is otherwise clearly written in the lease, the landlord must give you at least three days' written communication before filing for a temporary permit, whether or not the written document provides a longer time period during which the landlord can begin the eviction process.\n\nIt is possible for a landlord to ask a tenant to leave through eviction proceedings without providing a written lease.

    "\"... we consider a class of neural networks, called the Deep Ritz Network (DRN), motivated by solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by constructing a discrete least-squares approximation to an underlying PDE solution. In addition to being numerically stable (by design), we show that the DRN converges to the PDE solution as the number of hidden layers approaches infinity. Moreover, due to the infinite network width, the DRN is well-posed (in the sense that every minimizer is the global minimizer), unlike finite-width networks. We also consider several extensions to the DRN including adding data in the optimization problem, adding extra loss terms in the optimization problem (for instance, adding a penalty for non-locality), regularization methods such as batch normalization, and a numerical quadrature approach for discretizing the PDE. We also consider the case when the PDE has multiple solution branches, and show that the DRN can capture this behavior...\"\nThe following is the full text of the abstract for a research paper titled \"A Neural Network for Solving Differential Equations\" from arxiv.org:\n\"... We demonstrate the remarkable ability of a class of neural networks to approximate solutions to initial and boundary value problems for ordinary differential equations. We show that a well-trained neural network can take as input the initial condition and one or more boundary conditions and output a solution to the entire time domain; in short, it solves the differential equation with only an initial and boundary value problem definition. Moreover, our model can approximate the solution with arbitrary accuracy at any given time as long as sufficient data is available from the time domain. Using examples from 1D and 3D systems, we show how this strategy can be combined with numerical, analytical, or empirical approaches to model a broad range of systems, which span the spectrum from chaotic, transient, and oscillatory phenomena to steady-state systems. We further use our model to provide new insight into the classical problem of the Van der Pol oscillator.\"\nThe following is the full text of a comment from arxiv.org:\n\"...

    "Movie review by Michael H.\n\nThis is a great movie. I went in with the intention of watching something short. This movie is different but it is not boring. The plot is well thought out and it is also a very intelligent piece of filmmaking.\n\nI saw these two scenes that were written for this movie and I have learned nothing (I will not spoil though). It is all about the dialogue that is not really talked about because its not used. This is true for the rest of the movie: I'm only interested in the plot and where its heading.\n\nThe script is amazing. I really just had a laugh every time I heard the lines in the song: \"it is cold as we come\" or when she went out \"we get lost\".\n\nThis is one of the \"what have I done?\" movies out there. I know many people have reviewed this before but I thought I didn't have to see the movie.\n\nThe movie looks amazing. It was really scary even though every now and then you get some great looks. It was really interesting how this movie felt like a small story but at the same time its huge and it does end in a way that I don't want, or even think I should understand.\n\nI'm really glad I went in with that initial intention because this one is going to go down in my list of \"must-see\" movies (which I've read somewhere before) and that just proves that you should go in with that idea and watch the movie for yourself.\n\nI have seen many short films that are like this one (see: \"Lone Survivor\", \"The Place Beyond The Pines\", \"Pitch Black\" from \"Fast and Furious 7\"). If you enjoy movies that are short this is your movie!\n\nIn the end I'm very confused about what I just watched but I think it's an amazingly well made movie and that's really what matters.\n\n\"Pitch Black\" Trailer",

Their position is a total of 1550 units across Bitfinex, Bitstamp, GDAX, Gemini, itBit, Kraken, Poloniex and ShapeShift. This places Santander as the 12th largest holder of Bitcoin by value, according to blockchain.info, despite not taking the top spot for a single exchange.\n\"For each exchange, Santander's shares have increased dramatically since Q4 2017.

    "While I loved \"Shrek Forever After\" there are a number of minor problems with the film that detract from its overall quality of storytelling and acting. The movie's story is not only disjointed, but is also lacking in any kind of focus. It's clear the writers and director were more concerned about making an entertaining and funny movie and not trying to fully tell a story in the form of a traditional story arc. You see, we are told almost nothing about the background of our main character: The Duke of Deception. That's because he was born and raised in his family's magical forest known as The Evergreen Forest. Our hero comes to Decepticon HQ only by chance; he has been lured away by the princess of these woods, Princess Fiona. The only problem is that he doesn't know what he's doing and, as a result, he ends up doing more harm than good to Fiona and her kingdom.\n\nWe also never get any depth, development, or understanding into The Duke himself and why he does what he does. The only thing we really learn is that his father, who is a terrible man who doesn't want the Duke anywhere near his family, raised him to always follow the rules. It's made pretty obvious from the beginning that The Duke is not an intelligent man and we rarely do get the sense he makes good decisions with regards to what he does. On top of that, we never really get to know The Duke (with the exception of his brother Decepticon Lord, a far better character) like we would in a movie with some development for each character in the narrative. It's as if these two characters were only there to serve as story props to the overall plot, as if the film was afraid to actually tell a complete story and instead was instead trying to fill it with one giant joke!\n\nDespite those problems, the movie is still entertaining to see with excellent performances on the part of the cast and it's easily entertaining to watch. Those who may have had a hard time with the film in the previous reviews will find no problems with this one, however. I'll admit that the movie is flawed and the plot is a mess with numerous plot holes and subplot points that could've been made clearer and some dialogue that could've been better. However, I do enjoy this movie and will find lots of amusement in seeing The Duke do his things.",
    "\"Train to Busan\" is an emotionally gripping, adrenaline-fueled ride that puts a refreshing spin on the classic zombie genre. This South Korean masterpiece manages to expertly blend gruesome horror with deep emotional drama, creating a thrilling and emotionally resonant story that will stick with audiences long after the credits roll.\n\nDirector Yeon Sang-ho displays an impressive knack for creating suspense and terror. Scenes are crafted with tight pacing and inventive storytelling, making for an engaging viewing experience. His unique take on the zombie epidemic, set against the backdrop of a moving train, introduces a claustrophobic urgency that raises the stakes even higher.\n\nBut what really sets \"Train to Busan\" apart from other zombie flicks is its strong character development and emotional core. The cast of characters, led by Gong Yoo and Kim Su-an, are all flawlessly acted and feel remarkably real. This isn’t just a mindless gore-fest; it’s a film about sacrifice, family, and societal selfishness. The relationship between the father and daughter is beautifully explored, adding a depth of emotion rarely seen in this genre.\n\nThe special effects and makeup are top-notch, creating chilling and intense sequences of zombie attacks. The film’s high production values also extend to its impressive cinematography, which only enhances the incredible action and suspense that are a constant throughout the movie.\n\n\"Train to Busan\" overall is a wild rollercoaster of a horror film that manages to thrill and touch in equal measures. It demands your attention from the first frame to its gut-wrenching finale. Whether you're a fan of the zombie genre or not, this film is not one to be missed. It's a reminder that the best horror movies are not just about scaring the audience but also about making them care.",
    "Synopsis:\n\nThe story takes place in the late 19th century, in the mountains of Brazil. A man and a woman are fighting against the elements. During the fight, the man loses consciousness. An assassin comes, guns his way through the village, and kills all the residents of a neighboring village. The woman manages to kill the assassin, which causes the film to end in a dream. The woman gets out of the dream, and the man finds himself in the hospital.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2328100/\n\nThe above review could be accurate, I'm just saying its based on the trailer for the movie. It sounds like a fun movie.\n\nIf you watched the trailer, a few things make you think maybe this is based on a real life event.\n\n1) How many of the village people were killed. That was all in one scene, how can you assume they were all killed and the movie ends there?\n\n2) How did the woman make it to the hospital but not the man.\n\n3) What happened to the man's head wound. He could have been shot, but it doesn't seem likely to me.\n\nI will keep an eye on this movie and see if I feel it's real, I don't see a reason why it wouldn't be.",
    "\"Grave of the Fireflies\" is an intense and immensely powerful cinematic masterpiece. This film, set in Japan during World War II, tells the tragic yet poignant story of two young siblings, Seita and Setsuko, as they struggle for survival against staggering odds. Despite its animation medium, this film presents a brutally honest and heart-wrenching portrayal that is at times almost too painful to watch.\n\nThe director, Isao Takahata, employs supreme mastery over the art of storytelling. The narrative doesn't stray into the minutiae of the war, but instead focuses on the personal journey of the two main characters - a choice that makes the impact of this film far more profound. The depiction of the harsh realities of war, the loss of innocence, and the human will to survive are crafted with acute sensitivity and utmost precision.\n\nUniquely, this film does not draw on bright, euphoric colors, like many other animations. Instead, its landscape and imagery are painted with a melancholic palette, reflecting the somber and devastating undertones of war. The exquisite visuals manage to encapsulate the beauty amidst the ruins and the innocence surviving within the chaos. Yet, it never strays far from its core narrative and continually brings back the focus to the heartbreaking journey of Seita and Setsuko.\n\nThe voice-over performances are equally commendable. The actors bring an overwhelming sense of honesty to their characters. We feel for Seita's struggle and admire his resilience, while Setsuko's innocence and vulnerability invoke our empathy.\n\nWhat sets \"Grave of the Fireflies\" apart is its ability to simultaneously depict the horrors of war and the enduring power of the human spirit. It does not aim for shock value through graphic depictions of conflict, but instead utilizes a deeply emotional narrative to impart an equally disturbing sense of dread and heartbreak.\n\n\"Grave of the Fireflies\" demands to be felt rather than just simply observed. It is a poignant reminder of the never-ending cycle of war and its tragic consequences on humanity. Brace yourself for this masterclass in filmmaking which is sure to leave you profoundly moved. Although the subject matter is devastating, Isao Takahata's enduring masterpiece uses its heartrending tale to create a priceless artifact for the ages. In conclusion, \"Grave of the Fireflies\" is not just an animation, it is a film of a lifetime.",

    "Deep learning for ranking response surfaces with applications to optimal stopping problems\nC. Zhang 1,2 and A. G. Bartz 2 1Department of Mathematics, Colorado State University 2Department of Civil Engineering, Colorado State University The optimization problem with response surface modelling is investigated. Deep learning is embedded for parameter estimation and ranking response surfaces. The optimal stopping problem is first solved without considering the response surface, which is then integrated in ranking the response surfaces. Finally, a two-stage optimization problem is solved to consider simultaneously multi-dimensional response surfaces. The proposed method is then used for solving the optimal design of pavement rehabilitation by minimizing the pavement maintenance costs.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nOptimization problems (OPs) have been extensively investigated in many areas. OP problem is to find the optimum for some problem, which can be mathematically formulated as: where f min is the optimal value, x is the decision variable, and x ∈ X ⊂ R d. In OPs, the objective function f (x) is known. The decision maker only knows the value of objective function through a set of m observations (x i, f i ), i = 1, 2, · · ·, m. In general, the search space is limited because of cost of collecting data.\nOne approach to address above-mentioned problem is to rank potential points by the evaluation of their predictive values with data-driven models rather than using actual evaluations. A response surface (RS) is a technique, particularly useful when computing objective function value is expensive. RS models f (x) by fitting a function to data (x, f (x)) [1]. It is used here to rank candidate solutions. Given the model, the global optimum can be computed.\nThere are several approaches proposed to solve the optimal stopping problem (OSP) [2,3,4,5]: 1. The response surface of a candidate solution x is given.\nThen optimal stopping boundary is computed. An approximation of optimal value of OSP is then obtained by evaluating the optimal stopping boundary associated with each candidate solution.\n2. Optimal stopping boundaries for each candidate solution are given. Then optimal value of OSP is computed by evaluating optimal stopping boundaries for each candidate solution.\nThe OSP has been extensively investigated during the last few decades [2,3,4,",

    "\"The Ottoman Lieutenant\" is a beautifully mounted and visually appealing historical romantic drama set against the violent backdrop of World War I. Balanced judiciously between an epic-scale war drama and a poignant love story, the film delivers commendable performances, nuanced characters, and a well-narrated plot.\n\nThe lead trio, Michiel Huisman (as Ismail), Hera Hilmar (as Lillie), and Josh Hartnett (as Jude) deliver personalized, strong performances, with Huisman stealing the show with his charismatic rendition of an Ottoman Lieutenant. The chemistry and dynamics shared by the lead characters are beautifully handled, springing up unhurriedly but passionately with time.\n\nThe film ambitiously tackles various themes such as cultural differences, patriotism, and the brutality of war while underpinning a heartening love story. Joseph Ruben's direction strikes the right chord, beautifully blending these themes with appropriate doses of romance, action, and suspense. Although a few minor plot holes might question the historical accuracy of the film, the narrative ultimately makes up for it with its compelling storytelling.\n\nThe cinematography deserves a mention too, with Peter Menzies Jr.’s camera work capturing the vastness, beauty, and brutality of war-torn Turkey impeccably. It’s a visual treat that is often breathtaking, transitioning smoothly from panoramic shots of untouched countryside to war-inflicted landscapes.\n\nThe film's one deficiency may be its pacing. The first half takes time to build the characters and sets a slow pace, but this does lead to a more robust emotional investment in the second half, with the story picking up momentum and turning intense.\n\nWhile the love triangle and war backdrop might not break new ground in terms of originality, the film’s well-researched representation of the socio-political scenario in the Ottoman Empire during World War I adds a unique perspective to the genre.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Ottoman Lieutenant\" is a solid, emotionally-investing historical romance that is beautifully shot and well-acted. It offers a different, Turkish perspective on the events of World War I, and although it is not without flaws, it is an absorbing watch for fans of history, romance, and war dramas.",
    "'Little Britain USA' becomes the surprise hit everyone's talking about\nFrom CNN.com: TV critic Joe Pinsker wrote: \"The whole concept of this show [Little Britain], which, as I've described it, sounds like a rather thin premise, is really about exposing how often people get blinded by stereotypes.\" Here's his full review:\n\"As in the UK version, there are plenty of characters who aren't white, male and British. Here's a typical line: \"Excuse me,\" says a non-white man with a British accent to a ticket seller at a London Underground station. \"I need 3 singles to Hounslow.\" She shoots him a dirty look and says, \"We don't serve your sort here.\" (In a recent episode of \"The Office,\" a ticket seller was similarly dismissive of a nonwhite customer: \"Don't touch the ticket machine.\"). I was reminded, too, of a recent episode of \"Arrested Development\" about the Indian owners of a convenience store. They were modeled on Archie Bunker's friend Stivic: They were crude, rude, and generally annoying to everyone around them. But then, in the middle of a rant about how there were \"too many of you people around\" and on and on, they asked the customer, \"Wasn't that a lovely service?\" Then they proceeded to talk to the customer in their native tongue.\n\"These kinds of characters, however, are few. Mostly, the non-white characters are a little bit more, er, sympathetic. There are two recurring characters -- another couple -- who run a restaurant. They're South Asian Americans and they have an adorable habit of getting all excited and saying \"Soooo amazing!\" when describing their menu items.\n\"The American version has been a bit more cautious about how it presents its non-white characters. Here's the official BBC website for Little Britain, and one of its more popular characters is a white racist skinhead named Vicky Pollard, who works a series of low-rent jobs and constantly whines about being taken advantage of.\n\"In the American version, she's named Vicky Rude, but she's played by a black female comedian (in the UK version she's played by a white guy.) She still works a series of low-rent jobs and whines about being taken",
    "\"With my experience with making, there are a few things you need to know. There are some projects that I've seen go through a minimum contract rate of $200k per year, and some go through a minimum rate of $5000 per project. Let's be realistic, this isn't a business, this is a hobby, and there's no point you should be expecting a return on these projects. \"When I make a personal project, I need to make sure I'm in it for 5 years.\" That's the big one, and it's not something that you should expect of yourself. If you make a personal game, you need to play that game for at least 5 YEARS. I know, it sounds crazy. That means that by the time you get that $500k, it would take you almost a decade to get back to your last investment in your project's development. So to get there, you need to either take out an insurance policy against the project not being completed, make an extremely large investment in your time and have a large profit margin, or get another job. \"This also applies to when you make a business out of a personal game project, you also need to make sure it ends up being profitable; if you're an artist, you're making $10,000 a month and you start making other game assets, your income will be cut in half, and no one will want to give you a paycheck for this work, so there are limits to how profitable you can make a personal game.\" So the key takeaway here is that even the least likely thing that you can ever do, which is make a personal game, should ALWAYS be a profitable investment. In particular, making only a single game shouldn't cost you more than $500 a month to make. As a result, I think you end up having a much bigger ROI on any of your personal projects than your commercial products. Now to be fair, while you should always make your personal game profitable BEFORE you start getting paid money from it, you don't normally get paid for that. I will say that in the cases of making a couple smaller games after having spent 3 years making the one major project, it may pay off for you in the long run, depending on how it turns out. So, if your goal is to make personal games, that's where you",

Ideally, I'm looking for a 1-bedroom apartment and my maximum budget is around $1500 per month. Safety is an essential factor, as well as relative closeness to public transportation. \n\nI'd appreciate the community's insight on these aspects:\n1. Which neighborhoods should I focus on based on the above criteria? \n2. Are there particular websites or agencies that are a good starting point for apartment hunting?\n3. Is my budget realistic for a 1-bedroom apartment?\n4. What extra costs (apart from the known ones like utilities) should I be aware of when renting in NYC?\n5. Any general advice or tips on signing leases or red flags to watch for during my apartment hunt?\n\nApologies for the many questions, but this is my first potential out-of-state move and I want to be as prepared as possible.

    "My 8 year old son is not on medication because of his symptoms. He did not get any in grade 1 and did not need any by the beginning of grade 2. He is not on any other medication now and for the most part is able to interact with other kids and interact as he was before going through transition at 5. A year and a half ago he made a very bad mistake. A teacher got pissed that he was not using his pronoun and in response decided to call him a bitch. My son had no idea what she was talking about until he was in his 4th grade social class and then they informed him what happened. Now he has just started coming home late from school with a lot of missed lessons and very poor grades because of it. He was suspended for four days and made to stand in the back of the class (I am not sure if he had to stand before the whole class) while they went over what happened. She told the teacher that he was a bitch and that he deserved it for being a girl. It is really not fair that our school systems have created a climate of constant fear with regard to how to handle gender nonconforming kids. My son is now 8 and in the 5th grade. He is now a very good girl and has been for a while now. However because of this incident there are really bad things happening all the time. Kids are shamed because they use different pronouns and names than the parents. They are constantly reminded that they don't fit into stereotypes and how being different is a bad thing and how it is wrong that they are different. We have a lot of students that are very shy and it is really hard for them to try social situations because of the ways that their identity and expression can be seen as a threat. Because of the fact that my son was transgender I thought a lot more of him and was quite confident in how he was feeling about himself. However now that he is at a school that is very conservative and religious we are trying to explain to the teachers that gender doesn't matter at all. It is impossible to be one thing and the other. Gender is an illusion that only has to do with your outward appearance. He is a really quiet, nice, and caring boy but I don't want him to be afraid of his identity and that is in no way a good thing. It is almost like the",
    "As global media players scramble to adapt to rapidly changing consumer behaviour, an innovative strategy colloquially referred to as the 'Speak Easy' plan is emerging as a potential game-changer. This cutting-edge approach prioritizes voice technology to meet the growing demand for tailored, hands-free user experiences.\n\nThe voicing phenomenon is rapidly gaining traction across modern markets, underscoring the transformative potential of the 'Speak Easy' plan. As a mechanism of interaction, voice technology has been making massive inroads in various sectors such as home automation, customer service, online retail and fitness applications. Today, this convergence of technology and convenience has increasingly spilled over into the media landscape, leading industry giants to recalibrate their strategies and tap into the voice revolution.\n\nInternet titan Google, Amazon's popular virtual assistant Alexa, and Apple's Siri have already made significant strides into the terrain, introducing voice-enabled features within their platforms. The 'Speak Easy’ plan aims to harness these advancements, integrating voice control and response systems into existing media providers to offer a more intuitive, personalized user interface.\n\nExperts believe that the future of media consumption will hinge on the ability of businesses to create immersive, voice-activated experiences that resonate with user demands. \"The 'Speak Easy' plan is more than just a fad - it's a roadmap towards reimagining how we consume media,\" asserts tech analyst, Penelope Andrews.\n\nFor traditional media players, this could imply a transition from being mere content providers to becoming conversation facilitators. It hints at the potential of creating a dialogue with users, thereby fostering stronger loyalty and engagement. \n\nHowever, the implementation of the 'Speak Easy' plan is also fraught with challenges. With significant concerns regarding user privacy and data security, media platforms need to tread carefully while incorporating voice technology. In addition, developing an effective voice-interface that can understand and respond accurately across different languages, accents and dialects presents considerable technological hurdles. \n\nDespite the challenges, the 'Speak Easy' plan is an indication of where the media industry is headed. It marks the dawning of a new era where media is democratized, personalized, and responsive to verbal input. This change also opens up new avenues for revenue growth and customer retention for the media industry, turning the conventional dynamic of media consumption on its head.\n\nAs the voice phenomenon continues to build momentum, one thing is certain - the future of media consumption lies not just in what we see and read, but increasingly in what we say.",
    "Over the course of a few months, I've noticed an increasing number of bugs in my SteamVR experience, with the problems becoming particularly noticeable during lengthy play sessions. At first, I thought it was an issue of my equipment overheating as it generally does with extended use, but upon further discussion with other users on various forums, it seems I'm not the only one experiencing these issues.\n\nThe most persistent issues I've noticed include frequent crashing during gameplay, controller tracking glitches where they sporadically go flying off into VR space no matter how still I hold them, difficulty in recognizing the play area, audio glitches and in some cases, the games simply refuse to load altogether.\n\nI’ve tried many different troubleshooting solutions and even contacted Steam support, but have not seen any significant improvements. I’ve reinstalled the software, updated the firmware of my headset and controllers, and checked that my graphics drivers are up to date and even tried rolling them back to previous versions. I've experimented with lowering the graphics settings, force quitting unnecessary background processes, but no luck. \n\nThis buggy performance not only hampers the gameplay but also becomes extremely frustrating as it constantly interrupts the virtual reality experience. It makes the idea of immersing oneself into another world feel more aggravating rather than relaxing or fun.\n\nDoes anyone else face these issues or perhaps have found any solutions to them? It would really help if you share anything that helped fix these issues or even lessen their occurrence. Thanks for your help in advance.",
    "Abstract\n\nThe Cross-Denoising Network against Corrupted Labels (CCNN) technique is a powerful strategy for identifying the features of corrupted labels in medical image segmentation. Unlike other techniques, this one is not constrained to use low-precision images. Instead, it requires an image in which all the labels are aligned, which allows for a large number of labels (e.g., from a wide range of features like luminosity, texture etc.) to be extracted without having to discard features which are irrelevant to the main feature of interest (e.g., the label on the right as that would be irrelevant for that particular image). We present a novel algorithm which transforms the original image into a sequence of small images (e.g., one per each pixel). At each image, we transform the labeled feature map by a small number of steps to remove high-frequency labels from one image then repeat the process for the remaining images. The algorithm is able to reconstruct the original image in this sense. We evaluate the CCNN against popular image segmentation algorithms such as LDA in both image and segmentation dimensions. The results show that the CCNN can be competitive with a traditional segmentation. Moreover, we find that the feature maps of CCNN feature maps are more similar in general to feature maps of LDA, whereas their classification performance is close to that of conventional segmentation such as SVM/SVD.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this work, we present a method that makes use of the cross-denoising-network approach, named \"Cross-denoising Network against Corrupted Labels\", for detection of visual anomalies in medical image segmentation algorithms and the detection of image contamination from biological tissues and exteriors. A cross-denoising network (CDN) is defined as a non-linear feature map where each point, denoted by i, encodes a feature. The CDN maps the features onto the original image from one of the following categories of image regions. At each pixel, its value is modulated by a value from one of the three possible map directions: (a) -the original image is oriented perpendicular to the original image direction, (b) -the original image is oriented 90° relative to the original image direction, and (c)",
    "\"Click\" is a movie that goes beyond its seemingly simple premise to touch upon the depth of human emotions and existence. The perfectly cast Adam Sandler plays Michael Newman, a work-obsessed architect who stumbles upon a universal remote that provides the ability to fast-forward, pause, or redo parts of his life.\n\nIt may initially appear like a light-hearted comedy, given Sandler's comedic background, but it evolves swiftly into a profound commentary on life, relationships, and the perils of wishes coming true. One cannot ignore the inclusion of elements of dark humor intertwined with more profound scenes that make you question life choices.\n\nThe beauty of \"Click\" lies not just in its unique narrative but also in the extraordinary performances. Sandler shows great range transitioning effortlessly between comic moments to scenes infused with deep sadness. Kate Beckinsale, as his loving wife Donna, delivers a strong performance and their on-screen chemistry feels palpably real. The supporting cast, including the legendary Christopher Walken, bring their individual flair to the overall narrative. \n\nWhat truly sets \"Click\" apart is its ability to resonate with the audience on a deeply emotional level. It reminds us of the importance of valuing the present moment and the people in our lives. It makes us contemplate about our priorities and the balance between work and family.\n\nIn terms of production, the film boasts of excellent cinematography, with well-constructed montages that keep you engaged throughout. The film's score, though subtle, is perfectly curated to heighten the emotional beats of the story.\n\nAlthough \"Click\" features fantasy elements, it feels surprisingly authentic because of its grounded take on life's struggles. The film does have its share of flaws, including some predictable twists and a few instances of forced humor. However, these minor setbacks can be easily overlooked given the profound messages and impeccable performances.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Click\" is a movie that marries drama, comedy, and fantasy into a poignant tale. The charm of the film lies in its unexpected depths that leave you pondering long after the credits roll. It is certainly a must-watch for not just Adam Sandler fans but for anyone seeking a film that offers laughter, tears, and life lessons in equal measure.",
    "\"This paper shows that a fundamental equation of flow describing the motion of a gas can be solved using the standard-relativistic flux approximation, and that the solution is not in error. The equation is based on the fact that both the magnitude and trajectory of the flow are invariant under the vacuum potential. In the context of the study of vacuum processes, it has not already been described in detail. The flow equation also yields insights on the physical processes in the near-infrared region in non-relativistic optics. The paper discusses a special case for the case when the local gravity field can be written purely as Newtonian effects in the case of light transport (the case for a light beam which is trapped in the gas). Using this special case, quantum gravity is shown to be compatible with thermodynamics at the quantum level\"\nThe authors did an analysis of the results of their calculation. They found that under the vacuum case the vacuum energy of the fluid is higher than the energy of the gas and this is due to a net effect of scattering by the particles. The resulting pressure gradient along the gradient is the energy of the gas and will appear in the equations of the hydrodynamic equation (in the red section). Since this is the case for light, this does not mean that the energy of the fluid is zero in this case, but that the gas is free from any physical effects.",
    "This paper introduces a computer vision pipeline designed for automated determination of cardiac structure and function, as well as disease detection, through two-dimensional echocardiography. The goal of the system is to enhance the efficiency, accuracy and objectivity of echocardiogram interpretation, via automating assessment protocol. The pipeline was established by developing a machine learning algorithm that facilitates the extraction and analysis of key cardiac features. The study involves testing and validating the algorithm using a diverse set of echocardiograms, while comparing results with manual measurements taken by professionals. Experimental results demonstrate impressive robustness and accuracy in identifying various cardiac structures, evaluating their functions, and detecting cardiac diseases. This suggests an encouraging potential for the application of this pipeline in clinical settings, contributing to swift and objective cardiac analysis.",
    "I am going to let this post stand since I am fairly certain the content is something some people will be able to relate to. I am a 22 year old female with a B.A. in Psychology. I love psychology, but have decided to get an M.A. to further my knowledge.\n\nMy major concerns this semester are:\n\n1. Do I enjoy working with animals?\n\n2. Do I have enough knowledge to understand animals better and to apply that knowledge?\n\n3. Could I really get by if I was only studying with and dealing with humans?\n\nSo, after much soul searching, I decided to apply for an internship at the zoo.\n\nI applied to the zoo on a Friday the 13th (even though I received an email on Thursday that said it was already full), but was still on the wait list for four weeks. I felt like I was doomed. I spent more days and nights on the phone than I should have, looking for jobs. When I finally got a call that said the position was open, I was excited. I did my interviews at the zoo on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. I got through the interviews and I did not get an offer. On Thursday night, I was so stressed and upset, that I went out and was drinking so much I drove home. I called Friday morning to check my mailbox, and the position was still there, still filled. I did not want to believe it, but that's how I thought things seemed.\n\nOn Friday evening, I drove back to the zoo to meet with an internship coordinator who was in charge of the admissions interviews. To be honest with you, I was nervous. The interviewer did not really show it, he was very friendly and asked a lot of questions. When I arrived in the building and got in line to be interviewed it seemed so surreal and unreal. I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs!\n\nThe interviewer had me stand in front of a mirror and tell him all the things that were bothering me. Then he asked if I knew any animals and I slowly said yes and then he asked what I felt I had the knowledge to do. His response was a combination of shock and relief in a matter of seconds. He was very patient and gave me a lot of room in the interview. The interview went about fifteen minutes",
    "In a surprising turn of events, a court order has compelled R&B singer Mark Morrison to suspend the release of his comeback album. An ongoing legal dispute under the jurisdiction of the British court system is reportedly the cause behind this unprecedented action.\n\nAcclaimed as the \"King of British R&B\", Mark Morrison has produced classics like \"Return of the Mack\" and dominated the music scene in the 90s. This forthcoming album was slated to be a significant event, signaling Morrison’s return to the music industry after a long hiatus.\n\nHowever, due to an unresolved copyright dispute, the album has been put on hold. While the full details of the legal matter remain confidential at the moment, the court has issued a temporary injunction, prohibiting the release of any music from the album. Morrison’s representatives were tight-lipped about the incident but confirmed that the legal proceedings are in motion.\n\nThis unexpected news has stunned fans and industry insiders alike, who were eagerly anticipating the launch of the singer's new work. The album was expected to usher in a significant resurgence of the artist's career, following almost two decades since his last studio album. \n\nVarious online platforms and music stores that carried promotional material for the album have been notified about its indefinite deferment. The management has also removed the planned tracks list from Morrison's official website.\n\nMark Morrison first shot to fame in 1996 after his breakthrough single, \"Return of the Mack,\" made waves on both sides of the Atlantic. However, multiple run-ins with the law and personal issues saw the singer's promising career beset with difficulties. \n\nThe planned album was seen as a pivotal point in Morrison's career, but the legal injunction has escalated tensions both for the singer and his fans. As the album’s release sinks into uncertainty, the excitement of his comeback is overshadowed by the unfolding legal drama.\n\nUntil further notice, the album remains shelved. As fans await further developments in court, the only thing certain for now is that the \"return of the Mack\" will have to wait.",

    "Referring image segmentation (RIS) task aims to predict a mask of the referential object in an image. It is important yet challenging to segment the query object from complex scenes, while some stateof- the-art methods have been proposed to address this problem. However, all of these methods ignore the inherent structure of the objects in the images at the instance-level. We argue that this structure should also be exploited, and accordingly construct a two-stage reference framework based on object proposal, as a general solution for RIS. It is worth noticing that, the object proposal based on referring expression has brought new challenges, i.e., lack of labeled dataset and the sparsity and ambiguity in the referring expression. For the former, we have taken an active learning approach to obtain a small amount of labeled data and utilized it to train our proposed framework. For the latter, we have proposed a new referring expression segmentation (RESeg) dataset to tackle the above problems. To verify the proposed framework, thorough experiments are performed on our new dataset and a benchmark segmentation dataset Pascal- Context. The results show the promise of our RIS framework.\nRIS Dataset Generation Code:\nFor the RESeg method, the authors use the MS COCO segmentation dataset to generate the dataset.

    "In this paper, we introduce a new technique for scene understanding to facilitate autonomous manipulation in video games. By employing supervised learning, these techniques will be more robust and effective than similar approaches in the past where the user could control the camera and manipulate the world with the keyboard.\n\nWe propose using the camera to predict how the world will look when the user touches a cube or places a mouse on a target object. Given the predicted camera pose, we learn a set of constraints that, given a scene, defines how the user can interact with it.\n\nWe apply these scene understanding techniques to a series of visual game applications where each application is capable of simulating multiple environments in real time. These games represent scenes from science fiction stories such as Blade Runner or Transcendence. They make dramatic use of the notion of realism in video games to create compelling game environments. This paper introduces the method of Scene Understanding that allows robots to interact with their environments.\n\nWe demonstrate the ease of learning that can be achieved using this method and how these learning results map onto reality. We discuss where this is possible in the video game industry since only the video game industry has the ability to create compelling content.\n\nWe highlight the importance of developing a system with the power to learn such scenes from real world scenes. We propose how this is best achieved with generative adversarial nets and learn the difference between these approaches and how they differ in their capabilities. We demonstrate how an AI can learn to do these tasks without a human, thus allowing for future applications of autonomous devices to move objects around in virtual environments.",
    "Deep Learning-based Segmentation in Cardiac CT\nMedical imaging is important for the detection and evaluation of disease, especially for the diagnosis of cardiovascular health. Recently, deep neural networks have been applied to many medical-imaging applications with the aim to produce faster, cheaper and more accurate diagnostic scans. Deep learning methods have also been shown to improve results in comparison to image analysis by radiologists.\nIn this presentation, we will discuss the current developments in computer-aided diagnosis including the application of deep neural networks for the automatic extraction of relevant information from medical scans. We will then look at the current applications of deep learning techniques to the analysis and segmentation of cardiac CT scans.\nThis post from the website of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) contains a large collection of abstracts of presentations related to the application of artificial intelligence for cardiac computed tomography. Some of these papers appeared at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2014, held in Stockholm, Sweden in August 2014.

I just wanted to get back at her and make her feel the anguish/betrayal I had felt but also make her realize what a complete and utter bitch she is.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZNhR4U4.png)\n\nI went to school with this girl since middle school, but over time she started changing and became really weird and distant towards me. It got to the point where it would feel like she was laughing at things I said or even worse laughing at me when nobody else was around. It got to the point that she would make jokes about why I wouldn’t tell her why my parents sent me to an all-girls catholic school, and for the life of me, I couldn’t even tell her the truth. I was a trans girl. And she just started treating me very differently, coldly to the point where I started to ignore her. Eventually, she started to make fun of me behind my back. But in school, the teachers wouldn’t let the kids bully one another. I would always hear about the things she said about me, and I just pretended I was ignorant about them. One day, I had enough with it. I had just turned 18 and I tried to talk to her about it, but she just left the conversation. I didn’t say anything. I knew talking to her would be useless. Instead, I sent her a message asking her to meet up, but this time outside of school for us to have a more private talk about these things. She agreed that there would be no one at the park she told me to meet her at.\n\n> When I got to the park, her friend was there with her. As soon as I greeted her the two girls just looked at each other and laughed and left me standing in front of them. As I began to walk away, I could hear them laughing from further away. It was later that day when I got home that I discovered that they had taken a picture of me at the",
    "This academic paper delves into the mathematical theory of the \"Multiplicity One Theorem\" at full congruence level. The paper highlights the significant role of this theorem in the realm of algebraic number theory and modular forms. Our work extends previous research, particularly in understanding the congruence subgroups. We utilize a series of methodical techniques and tools, ranging from Siegel modular forms to congruence-level Eigenforms, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Finally, through rigorous analysis, we confirm that \"Multiplicity One\" holds at all congruence levels, a result which may push the boundaries of current algebraic understanding.",
    "Memory Networks for Interactive VBM Segmentation A memory network, also called a network of memories, is a method of constructing models of large-scale real-world systems. Using a memory network, we can decompose an image into components, and then train a neural network on the images to derive a final model that predicts the location of the most important features in the image. One might expect that a memory network could be made to work well with human-level performance, but in fact, the accuracy of our network on the first test set only approached human level. Our study introduces a new, flexible memory network architecture that exploits the complementary nature of several aspects of visual memory — its flexibility, modularity and non-linearity — by encoding the temporal dynamics of a scene into memory. We propose a novel memory network architecture that allows for efficient training and inference, using both local and global memory to augment or replace the global memory available in many real world application.\n\nAbstract\n\nWe demonstrate the power of a memory network, also known as a network of memories, to decompose an image into components, and then train a neural network on the images to derive a final model that predicts the location of the most important features in the image. Our study introduces a new, flexible memory network architecture that exploits the complementary nature of several aspects of visual memory — its flexibility, modularity and non-linearity — by encoding the temporal dynamics of a scene into memory. We propose a novel memory network architecture that allows for efficient training and inference.\n\nThe image shown above is an example of a memory network in action. The network will first predict the location of the best looking object on the image, and then it will predict the location of other objects as well. Since visual memory is nonlinear — the locations of features change as they move across the image — the network learns to associate both the location of the best looking object and the location of any other objects with the same locations. As this occurs, the network will automatically associate the locations of the objects at each location with the same locations and the correct objects will fall to the bottom.\n\nThe following is an animated GIF from arxiv.org showing this process in action:",
    "(Note: it does not contain footnotes)\n\nThere are very few works that can be used to interpret the architectural remains, but a lot of work has been done, from examining the plans to piecing together what the details look like.\n\nTwo articles that are good for interpreting the fortification complexes are Anatolian Fortifications and Fortification Research Project.\n\nThe Anatolian Fortifications document is the best source we have for describing Anatolian Fortifications. It consists of drawings, plans, and descriptions of what is known of the ancient fortifications. The best part is the description of how everything was constructed with many details that have still not been explained.\n\nI think of Anatolian Fortifications as the best work as the descriptions that follow are more or less exact and consistent, in a way that you can learn from the way the ancient construction systems worked.\n\nIf you want to learn about how the Anatolian Fortifications were built, here is the article for that: Anatolian Fortifications\n\nThe Fortification Research Project does a kind of comparative study of other fortifications and some reconstructions of the fortifications. These structures have not been excavated yet, but they do have a lot of images that help draw out the kind of construction systems.\n\nHere is a description of the project from Wikipedia: Fortification Research Project\n\nThese descriptions are very helpful, but most of the information is not complete.\n\nA lot of the information is incomplete at this point. We understand the Fortification Research Project to be trying to fill in those gaps. They do a good job of making plans and drawing the fortification but that is a very narrow glimpse at the construction.\n\nSo some of the information that is available needs to be improved.\n\nThey are also using Wikipedia as a source of information, which can be a good way to get some information up to date, but there is much I do not understand in that source.\n\nIt has not been fully updated and it would be good to know how recent that information is that they have to draw from.\n\nAnd although I understand they are compiling information from a number of sources, there is much going on in the archaeological record that is still not well understood.\n\nHere",
    "Just wanted to vent some frustrations here and see if anyone has had similar experiences. I've been having some serious issues with my EC3 connectors literally melting during use. This is a significant issue as I'm trying to go for longer fly times.\n\nI've done everything by the book - proper soldering, no reverse polarity, made sure I'm within the current ratings, etc. But no matter what, these darn things just start to melt after a short period of heavy load. It didn't happen when I first started using them, but it seems to be a recurring issue now. I've switched to EC5 for my larger drones and I've got no such problems there.\n\nAnd here's where the real frustration comes in, the customer support from Horizon Hobby. It's been absolutely abysmal. Long wait times on the phone, and when you finally get through to someone, they either have no idea how to help or just promise a callback that never comes. I've emailed and tried their online chat - still no real help. \n\nI am not only dealing with malfunctioning connectors but also with such poor customer service which is definitely not worth the time and money invested. This is not what I expected when I purchased products from a reputed brand like Horizon.\n\nJust had to vent. Anyone else having any similar experiences with either melting EC3 connectors or poor Horizon Hobby support? Any advice on dealing with this?\n",
    "“Snatch” is a great comedic action drama. It stars Benicio Del Toro, Jason Stratham, Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina, Mickey Rourke and Daniel Craig. Written as something more serious, then becoming a comedy after the writers went to England to do research, the movie is a dark but funny action film.\nI’m normally not a fan of action films, but this is one of my favorites. It has all sorts of action, but not the usual stuff, it has a weird humor that makes me laugh hard, and it has a story that brings you on from beginning to end.\nThe movie is about a diamond thief that has just been released from prison and has to pull one last heist, but the heist has fallen onto the hands of a group of other criminals. One of the members is planning something big, and wants a few others in on it. But these others already are in on it. And what starts as a small deal soon turns into a huge battle with all sorts of people, all sorts of money, and all sorts of weapons. Each group of people comes at each other with a different view on different ways the deal should go down.\nThe movie is very violent and not for youngsters, but if you like action, violence, and a bit of humour, this movie is for you. My advice is watch it, and see what you think. This is definitely one of the best action movies ever made.\nI highly recommend this movie as a worthwhile, though slightly over-rated, film. The two lead characters, Benicio del Toro and Jason Stratham, are excellent, and the way they interact with each other and with the rest of the cast is simply flawless and highly entertaining. Mickey Rourke, playing Tommy \"Mastermind\" Cruden, is the main villain of the film. As with most of Mickey's performances, this one is a little over-the-top, but he does a fine job. Dennis Farina also does a fine job of playing the role of one of the main bad guys, Mr. Brown. This film is also full of humor, and the combination of Del Toro, Stratham, and Farina, along with some of the supporting characters is a good one. The acting of all involved is superb, especially Benicio, Jason, and Mickey.\nThe movie is",
    "Greek athlete, Ekaterini Thanou, is eager to stage a convincing comeback, following two unsuccessful attempts at a return to athletics.\n\nThe 46-year-old sprinter, once considered among the fastest women in the world, believes she has the tenacity and resolve to regain her position in international track and field, despite her lengthy absence.\n\nOf her determination to return, Thanou told reporters, \"I still have the passion and hunger to compete at the highest level. I see my previous setbacks not as failures but as stepping stones.\"\n\nThanou, dubbed one of the most controversial figures in athletics, has faced a plethora of challenges throughout her career. She won an Olympic silver medal in Sydney in 2000, but her world turned upside down after testing positive for banned substances in 2004 along with fellow sprinter Kostas Kenteris.\n\nHer unhappy brush with doping allegations ahead of the Athens Games was a major blow that resulted in suspension from international athletics for two years.\n\nRecalling those tumultuous events, Thanou said, \"There were dark times, of course, but I have always tried to learn from my experiences. I view my past as a source of strength.\"\n\nThe Greek athlete attempted unsuccessful comebacks to the sport in 2006 and 2008. Those attempts marked crucial turning points that inspired her to set her sights on a final comeback that would alter public perception.\n\nNow, having served her ban and worked relentlessly to rehabilitate her reputation, Thanou believes she's ready to return to her sport.\n\nDespite her age, the Greek sprinter does not see it as an obstacle. Instead, she promotes it as an advantage - a roadblock overcome by years of honed experience.\n\n\"I just need a chance,\" she stated, her tone underlined by a mix of desperation and resolve.\n\nOn the criticism that followed her doping scandal, Thanou remained composed, suggesting that it only strengthened her desire for redemption, “The criticism and the doubt, it just fuels me. It inspires me to prove to myself and the world that I can still compete successfully.\"\n\nAs she plans her comeback, Thanou has been visibly training in her native Athens, displaying an unwavering commitment to preparation. Her objective is clear – to don the green and white of Greece once more, backed by a spirit of resilience and determination.\n\nQuestions arise about the feasibility and validation of another return by Thanou, considering her history in international athletics. Yet, the resolute sprinter remains undeterred; even while it remains to be seen whether or not her",
    "Abstract.  A theory of language composition proposes that a piecewise recursive language, one in which the components of its grammar are the only source of grammatical information, follows a certain logic.  Theoretical computer simulations suggest this to be true from a linguistic perspective.  This paper investigates this hypothesis in more detail and tests it experimentally.\nIntroduction We suggest that languages which are piecewise-testable, meaning that the components of their grammar are the only source of grammatical information, follow a particular logic of composition.  In other words, rather than being made from smaller languages, the smallest structure that will produce a grammatically correct whole is simply a subset of a larger structure.  Our approach is based on the understanding of subwords - non-terminals of words that, when reduced to their most basic structure as well as their most frequent constituent items, give a consistent pattern of composition between words (Wang 1999; see also [2]).\nTo explain this language composition point:  we know a language is piecewise-testable as long as the word order of its constituent items is well-defined and each is the single source of any information about the sentence in the language.  Therefore, we have three cases of piecewise-testable languages:\n-- A language where most of the vocabulary is non-terminals, therefore subwords in that context can be reduced to their most basic form and their usage can explain any grammatical behavior.\n-- A language with a word order on the left hand side where it is a non-terminal, therefore parts of the component pieces interact to produce grammar, but it is possible to reduce the components down to their most basic form (most obvious if they start with consonants, since they also share a common phonological inventory with that word).  (Note that a right-hand sentence might not even be composed at all, but a combination of both left- and right-hand words, in this extreme case.) The simplest case for this language is that of English.  For instance, in a context in which a non-terminal such as \"the\" is used as a \"subword\" in the sentence, we could argue it's a case of \"the\" is a subword (and",
    "\"I had the pleasure of viewing Stanley Kubrick's 1975 masterpiece \"Barry Lyndon\" in a theater on a high definition transfer last week. It is a very interesting film to watch on a big screen at this particular point in time. Like \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" its visual design seems almost painfully modern. The film has a very interesting visual design, which makes me wonder why this was not a film made from a 3-D source. We see many long shots of vast landscapes, the actors all are quite faraway from the camera, and the film has a strange, dreamlike pace to it. I've no doubt it was Kubrick's intention, since the source material seems to be more suited to surrealism, not realism. The source material, \"The Luck Of Barry Lyndon\" by William Makepeace Thackeray, seems to be quite well known in the United States as the main character of Thackeray's story inspired two of the great 19th Century American novelists. Thackeray's work was probably the first modern \"Bildneromam\" (Novel of manners), and so we get a lot of modern elements in this story. We get a lot of dialogue and monologuing about what things or people mean, and sometimes it seems like every character in this film will spend at least a couple speeches trying to describe something that the camera could easily have shown. What you have to try and get used to, especially when watching \"Barry Lyndon,\" is that Kubrick wanted us to get into the characters' heads, not only by means of dialogue, but by watching them act in their most mundane scenes. Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is an anti-villain, and so his actions are shown without too many close-ups or intimate \"heroic\" moments. In a scene where he tries and fails to kill his lover's husband for seducing her, there are no images of Barry on screen for most of the scene, only his hand, his knife, and the victims' face. I actually had no problem with that, since the entire film is so slow, and the viewer is already forced into Barry's mindset, so why show some bloody images? There was not much blood in this movie. \"Barry Lyndon\" is really more of a documentary about Barry's life than a drama or a costume piece.",
    "I want to be clear first, that I have no interest in doing anything more with this person than informing the Queen how he acts around her, and then to leave her to whatever she wishes to do with the information. My only focus here is her peace of mind, and I do not wish a conflict to arise between her son and herself. She is the one person in his life who has always loved him and been a real, caring parent.\nThis post exists because I am at my wit's end with Prince Charles. In all honesty, I believe him to be the most pathetic person I have ever seen. He has never been able to have a job, he has not done anything special with his life, and he is utterly obsessed with the idea of \"saving the world\" or \"changing the world\" or whatever you want to call it. It has to be done by \"charity,\" because he will take credit for everything and he feels that he should not be seen as a \"profit-making machine\" by those around him. It is just one excuse to be able to control people's lives when they should have the right to take care of themselves.\nI am sure that everyone knows there is a strong possibility that Prince Charles will be the next monarch in the United Kingdom. The people are desperate for change and he has been very skillful at getting the public on his side while at the same time being viewed as the most \"down-to-earth\" person in the royal family.\nI will be blunt about this. Prince Charles is a coward. Not a brave one who has taken any action against those who oppose him but a coward who simply does not take action in all but the easiest of situations. It is the cowardice, the complete lack of bravery that scares me. This is a man who has been put in the spot as the next monarch in the United Kingdom, but he is still scared to take any action that would actually have an effect on his life.\nThe United Kingdom is a very wealthy country, but it has become a country in which the citizens are expected to pay taxes to keep the government afloat. It has taken this \"money saving\" ideology and it has turned it into an anti-capitalism movement that is gaining an audience fast. Prince Charles is part of that group and he has been able to keep",
    "\"Guys i gotta ask all what you think\" (from r/IAmA) I'm not sure what to say or what I'm going to say so I just want to get this out there. This is the first post in the r/IAmA thread \"It's my first reddit\" and in some cases I get a lot of push back and have to apologize on occasion for the post. However, with reddit and the community this is my first time ever doing anything like this. I decided to post this question because when I posted on /r/redditdev I had a few requests from other r/IAmA users so it was only natural to ask them how they liked it. Here's the first question that came out of the gate: \"Why do you do this?\". And i got more: \"You're a great person\" \"The community is great that is great!\" And then: \"How do AMA?\" One guy stated that he did it on behalf of his boss and another said he did it for his child. To me as an admin, it seems that asking a question is just like any other form of communication, it has its own unique way of being used and this is no different from asking questions in ANY of our forums or at r/IAmA any way! I guess we'll see soon because this was about 1.5 hours into the AMA. The first thing I did was email /u/Kappa_Is_Ginga who had been in the community since it's inception and who is now a moderator of reddit.com. He was on the front page with \"AMA\" in the title and he was able to guide me through the AMA and give me all of his advice. I decided to ask why. He said to be honest and just have fun. I agreed because I know that it's kind of a thankless task with thousands of people who want to see an AMA. I started with the basics, what is /r/IAmA and why I'm here! I said I'm here to have fun, I don't want to be rude, the mods are nice enough I'm sure I can get through this. And then I got to it! After posting the AMA I got a lot of questions from the community on how the process works and where to post. I asked my admin friend: \"How much does it cost",
    "If you're looking for a movie set in modern-day Germany that deals with the topic of Nazism, but don't want to feel manipulated and depressed by it, \"The Reader\" is a worthy pick. As a whole, it is very well-made. It's not necessarily an easy movie - it's filled with dark subject matter and features two main characters who are difficult to like. Yet, it is far from depressing. There is an interesting plot to follow, and its ending is open enough to leave one with a sense of fulfillment.\nThe movie tells the story of a teenage orphan named Michael (David Kross). He is adopted after World War II by a woman named Hanna (Kate Winslet), an attractive older woman who has trouble connecting to him on an emotional level. We follow Michael as he turns from a young teenager into a troubled young man in his early 20s. The story also follows Hanna's efforts to come to peace with the choices she made during the war. (One of the reasons she had trouble connecting with Michael was because of the fact that she was forced to send him away to the countryside - Michael is a Jewish half-orphan who lost his parents to the Nazis.)\nDespite the heavy subject matter, this movie is a great watch for those who want to see a movie set in modern-day Germany. As noted above, it does not dwell on the past. It does not glorify it. Most of the movie takes place after World War II. Thus, there are two things for the audience to consider: what really happened in the 1930s, and the impact of those things on the psyches of contemporary Germans.\nIt also does not glorify Germany after the war, which is the subject of many a German film. However, the film does show that the people who lived through those devastating times have had a hard time coming to peace with themselves. Some never have. And some never fully will.\nThe movie is not perfect, though it is quite good. Its biggest flaw is its uneven pacing. The opening act is slow, but the end act does a lot to make up for this. The second act is slow (the beginning of this act is a particularly slow part of the movie), and the final part of the third act is quite fast. While this may help you get through the movie, it does mean that the movie slows down in",
    "A meticulous object segmentation approach, the result of which is that only non-important objects are removed (eg., the grass, the road, the sky), and important objects are preserved (eg., a human, animal, or vehicle). The main step is to first perform semantic segmentation, and then refine the pixel mask of the corresponding segmentation results by using the instance attention module by re-scanning the instance segmentation results. We adopt U-Net as the semantic segmentation network backbone and Mask R-CNN as the instance segmentation network backbone. The proposed segmentation method has the following characteristics: 1) High precision. 2) Non-important objects (such as grass, sky) are completely removed, and important objects (such as an animal) are preserved.\nThe following is the full text of the abstract for a research paper titled \"Inducing and Learning Non-Adversarial Examples for Robust Object Detector\" from arxiv.org, by authors Yixuan Cheng1, Qiao Chen, Jianhua Gong and Jiefeng Deng.\nRobust object detectors are expected to have similar performance even for input images with slight perturbations. State-of-the-art methods typically rely on adversarial samples with strong perturbations to train these robust detectors. But there is still a big performance gap between adversarial training and supervised training. We proposed an approach to inducing and learning non-adversarial examples (INLE). The key idea of INLE is to induce non-adversarial examples as well as learn their relationships. Two modules are proposed to achieve this goal. One is IN module for inducing non-adversarial examples from adversarial ones, the other is LEN module for learning non-adversarial examples from adversarial ones. Specifically, IN module first learns to map adversarial examples to their original input space by GAN-based models, and then refines the generated non-adversarial examples by the guidance of the adversarial examples. LEN module, on the other hand, is to learn the non-adversarial examples from adversarial ones with a L2 normalization loss. We have compared the results with baseline networks (ie., Faster RCNN, SSD) and adversarial networks (ie., AIF, AAM), and the results demonstrate that our INLE has the potential to improve the performances of detectors substantially.

    "I know a certain set of girls (or women) in my university's art department. They're all in their late 20s and they're all interested in art and all have good technical skills but they are also very introverted.

    "So we come to the story of Joy and Sadness. Joy's emotions (and later, sadness) are inextricable from the story itself. It's also important to remember that they have only been given a limited and conditional control over her life and what happens to the outside world. She must make decisions at her own volition. Joy also must learn that her emotions are sometimes wrong. And if they are, how can they ever be forgiven and accepted? I'll call this story Sadness.\n\n\"Inside Out\" is a story about a family in turmoil. Joy's dad is lost, and Sadness, her mom, and the kids are all dealing with grief, isolation, and confusion. The movie, directed by Pete Docter (\"Up\"), portrays Sadness through the family's perspective. As Sadness, the character, the emotions are portrayed with a calm, controlled, and controlled force. As Joy (Angela Bassett), the character, their emotions are more erratic and out of control.\n\nBut because Sadness and Joy are two separate people, these issues become much more complicated and difficult. To complicate matters more, Sadness never tells her dad anything he doesn't want to hear. She always acts without question; she never stops to take it all into account. For example, when Joy's dad asks her if she's hurt at all this year, she responds, \"It's just that everything's moving so fast — it's like a blur.\" Her reaction is one of complete shock at the question, then a completely different one when Sadness asks if her mom had any idea what she was getting into. We also see, over and over again in the movie, Anger and Disgust trying to get Joy to come out of her shell, while Joy refuses and becomes more and more aggressive in her reactions. Sadness seems to get the better end of it, but she still has no idea how to handle Joy (Angela Bassett). I'm not sure if Joy has ever been taught to tell her emotions to leave her alone, so she continues acting as if Sadness is not real to her. At the movie's end, when Sadness is in that diner with a bunch of kids, Joy looks very happy as though their relationship, at least in terms of emotional involvement, is all fine.\n\nDespite all this, that doesn't mean Sadness's emotions",

    "This is not a film about a football star. The man is a failure. He becomes an NFL player and becomes the highest scoring defensive back in football history because he can never get the ball in his hands. He's a joke. But he'll never be a failure.

The film doesn't even pretend to.\n\nThe cast never once loses their composure and they don't let their characters' faults get in the way of the story. It's incredible that a TV series allowed them to get away with that. At least at first. After all, when the NFL and the players started to lose, the league had an idea of what was good for him. But it's not all about how they look at him, and they know that the real fans don't like him and want him out of there.\n\nCox, the only person who is able to convince the man he is still needed by the team even after they see him play all his games as a joke, comes in later in the film when it's too late to save him.

If he hadn't made the right decision at the right time, Cox probably would've been in big trouble after all these years, and the NFL would've let him walk as a real failure. But at the exact moment he realized what needed to be done, he had nothing going on.",
    "This is an excellent post. When I first read it, something clicked. It's true, I don't think there will be a single AI takeover scenario. I think we're looking at a bunch of situations where people and robots coexist. But this post makes me think about them differently.\nI'll start with some background. I work in tech and have been working mostly in autonomous vehicles. I have also done consulting for various government agencies. So I try to keep my head on straight about AI.\nIn my opinion, the scenarios that are most likely are (1) slow spread of the capabilities of existing AI systems, (2) a sudden and shocking surprise about what was possible with current capabilities that wasn't broadly understood until that surprise happened, (3) a few specific use cases of AI systems that are better than anything that currently exists (I would include robotics as part of this group). They're also most possible in (1) government and (2) business.\nWith a few more details about these categories:\nIn government, there's plenty of work going on at multiple levels of government, both in terms of basic research and in terms of specific applications. A perfect example of the latter is the use of AI systems to scan through drone footage and identify people of interest. That system was tested for a while until the Pentagon killed is. Maybe it was too creepy. Maybe it didn't work. Maybe it was too successful and we didn't like what it said about us.\nIn business, we have seen companies like Waymo (a car company owned by Google) and Microsoft in the AI space. I don't understand why these companies aren't mentioned in this post, but then I realize that it says \"AI systems that are better than what we know currently exists\" and not simply \"AI itself\". I assume that this was intentional and not a mistake.\nSo far, I would agree that the scenarios are most likely to work in these spaces.\nA sudden and shocking surprise about what was possible with current capabilities that wasn't broadly understood until that surprise happened -- this makes sense. We get so excited about the future that we forget that these things have already happened. For example, during the \"silicon revolution\" (see below for more context), we were talking about using transistors on integrated circuits. Well, we already had those things. But they had been used",
    "The UK Government's ability to spend on public services will not be affected by European Union (EU) rules, according to a new announcement. The news follows concerns raised by critics that UK's continued adherence to certain EU regulations could hinder economic recovery.\n\nThe claim that EU rules will not affect the UK’s ability to boost spending on public services was made in response to a statement put forward by critics warning the government about the potential economic risks of EU regulations. These critics have argued that some of these regulations would prove obstructive in post-Brexit Britain as the country tries to revive its economy amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, the UK Treasury has dismissed these concerns, stating that Britain's withdrawal from the EU means it is no longer bound by the bloc's economic and fiscal rules. Furthermore, despite committing to avoid unnecessary regulatory divergence, the UK has the ability and the right to create its own set of financial policies and regulations post-Brexit.\n\nA Treasury spokesperson commented, \"Now that we have left the EU, we are not under their legal jurisdiction. This means we are not subject to EU budget rules, and any assertion contrary to this is incorrect.\"\n\nThe Treasury further explained that the new relationship with the EU does not impede the UK's financial sovereignty nor its power to introduce robust public spending measures. The Brexit deal allows the UK to operate as an independent coastal state and to control public spending as needed.\n\nThe UK Government has positioned this as a victory for national autonomy, highlighting the increased flexibility Britain will have over its budget post-Brexit. \n\nThis announcement comes at a time when public spending is under intense scrutiny due to the financial strains of the Covid-19 pandemic. The UK Government has pledged significant funds to revitalise the economy and support health and social care sectors.\n\nYet, despite assurances from the Treasury, some remain sceptical about the impact of remaining aligned with certain EU rules and how this could affect the UK's economic recovery.\n\nWhile the Treasury was firm in their statement, the UK's future economic relationship with the EU will continue to be a topic of debate among critics and politicians. The real test, however, will be seen in how the UK's economy responds in a post-Brexit and post-pandemic world.",
    "This paper introduces an innovative approach towards image pixel clustering utilizing a novel algorithm based on the Mussels Wandering Optimization (MWO) technique. This method aims to expedite and elevate the accuracy of image analysis and segmentation. The MWO algorithm imitates the unique foraging and wandering behavior of mussels, thereby optimizing cluster centers for color images automatically. Experimental results show that the proposed MWO-based pixel clustering method provides significant improvements in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and computation time, compared to traditional methods. It concludes that this model could be a promising tool for unattended image processing in various applications, such as digital image enhancement, object recognition, and medical imaging analysis.",
    "Hello to everyone on this forum, I am a 39 years old male. I have suffered some health issues over the last few years and just like the majority of people I have spent hours and hours Googling symptoms and I am a little concerned about it but I still do it because I am curious and I love learning, I am pretty much a Google doctor. And what bothers me the most is that I have had panic attacks (mostly during the night at least 3 or 4 times per week) and whenever I have one I start to think about my health, my heart, even though I was not in any sort of physical trouble and yet, I had a major panic attack. I don't know if they are a result of over thinking about my health or my health itself triggered it because I have some slight heart arrhythmia, I used to have high BP, that's the reason I don't have to take any medication (but my heart arrhythmia is always there and I can even feel it, I am hyper sensitive and notice even the slightest changes in my body, but usually it is not a symptom that bothers me too much or that I would mention because I don't care too much about feeling my heart beating fast or the flutteriness in my pulse (it is just annoying for me), in fact I love it when I feel my heart beating fast because it means I am in a good shape and I have a strong heart.. but it was bothering me and I noticed that it was bothering me whenever I had a panic attack. But I have never thought that these heart palpitations can cause panic attacks because I've never ever had one.. until recently I started to feel like it is triggering panic attacks because my friend has one and it seems like it's getting worse every time she has one.. she was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder but she is still taking medication for the heart arrythmia because she is still having them, it seems like she is still worried about it and she told me that she had a terrible panic attack last night.\nNow I am really nervous and worried about it\nSo I am wondering did anyone here (who actually had a real heart problem) experience a panic attack because of those heart palpitations? And if you did, was it because your body was reacting and trying to trigger an \"emergency mode\"? And did you find out yourself or your doctor found",
    "Abstract\n\nThe objective of this work was to develop image quality augmentation for visually impaired individuals with a non-rigid semantic patch technique for augmenting images to reduce visually perceptible noise. We evaluated performance of the non-rigid semantic patch technique using both a standard method of face image enhancement and a novel experimental method of semantic patch image enhancement (SPIN). For the enhancement task, we applied patches with different intensities (e.g., 6 different intensities) and for the statistical optimization method, we applied multiple patches which allowed the enhancement of a face to be performed according to local maxima that were localized by a single non-rigid patches. Our work has demonstrated that our method is sensitive to variations in noise intensity for the visually impaired compared to a comparable method by the same group of researchers that used a non-rigid patch approach and did not find any significant improvement in visual perceptibility. Furthermore, performance improvements were achieved on the same set of faces under the non-rigid patch versus the conventional method. Results are consistent with those of other image augmentation studies that use patch methods with different patch densities [Hansen et al., 2008; van Boxtel et al., 2014; Sato et al., 2014]. Using an automated training program, our work demonstrates that the non-rigid semantic patches are robust to variations in patch quality and image contrast, the patch density is adequate for the operation of the method, and performance improvements can be achieved easily and successfully on the same set of faces.",
    "The recent advent of machine vision, in combination with the burgeoning field of image understanding of medical image data, will create opportunities for surgical image analysis and simulation. Although there have been attempts to create a generic approach, each method has been limited in its applicability. This work presents an image-compositing method where the surgical tools and their associated anatomy are identified and segmented through a process of normal mapping, image normalisation, and segmentation. This work is a continuation of other work in this area including some recent work on creating a high-resolution, multi-layered neural network model of the human anatomy using convolutional neural networks. By constructing a model, which represents the underlying structure of the hand and hand movement, that contains individual hand bones and joints, we can then segment the resulting hand model using a network-based method. This enables researchers to create complex human anatomy in the simulation environment using traditional computational techniques such as manual annotation. While this methodology can provide an alternative to manual annotation of surgical tools, some challenges have to be overcome to ensure the accuracy needed for these simulation cases.\n\nIn this article, we describe an image-compositing method for segmentation of human surgical tools. We present a hand-model model that serves as the 'base structure' for segmentations; in other words, this model represents all bone and joint structure. We then use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate and reconstruct a segmentation representation for each individual hand model. The segmentation representations we use are a series of 3-D'shapes' consisting of points at 4 vertices per hand, with 64 vertices per hand. We then use a series of kernel networks to generate a series of'shapes' from the segmentation representations for each individual hand model, resulting in a single 3-D shape representing the hand. The result is an image representation of the hand that can be easily manipulated into a 3-D hand model using the SurgicalToolViewer tool. We demonstrate the use of sfv.segmentation to segment the surgical tools of the hand of a live surgery patient, using multiple operations with surgical tools. The segmentation results can be exported into a training dataset for subsequent human-model refinement.\n\n(via PhysOrg.com; all images courtesy of iStockPhoto",
    "> **Abstract:**\n> **Domain adaptation** and **label unification** (DLU) are two promising directions that play an important role in alleviating overfitting to datasets with only a subset of true labels. The performance of supervised domain adaptation is significantly suboptimal when test-time labels in a target domain are in disagreement with the labels from training data. The main problem of DLU is the high-dimensional manifold that labels from multiple datasets are located on. Most recent DLU approaches are based on the assumption that the manifold of labels is linear. In this work, we propose a framework that enables both DLU and domain adaptation with only a partial dataset from the target domain. We propose to learn a data-driven label unification model that captures the non-linear relationships between labels from multiple domains. We show that our method enables to find novel features and corresponding labels that are helpful to improve the performance of DLU and supervised domain adaptation. Our experimental results on standard benchmark datasets including Office-Home, VLCS, and VisDA validates our proposed framework.\n>\n> <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07672>",

    "My name is Brandon and I'm 21 years old. I've been out of college and holding full time jobs for 5 years now and yet I've had no real luck at being able to build up any meaningful, professional, social life.\nI've had many jobs, starting my first one at 15 at a convenience store and have continued since with different levels of employment. The jobs have ranged from working minimum wage fast food jobs at McDonalds and the local pizza hut to working more customer-oriented jobs with cashiers and managers. I've never made the same level of money and have been forced to relocate myself to different places in order to continue any hope of having a stable income through my career. The last job that I worked on was as a cashier at an upscale grocery store and it paid me just under $10 an hour...which is great! I was happy because I was going to begin a whole new chapter in my adult life, but it turned out that this chapter would be short due to the fact that I was forced to relocate again (long story).\nMoving locations is really hard for my situation as I don't have any friends nor do I have a car. I don't know much about a city that I've lived in for 2 weeks before I decide to commit to settling down there. When I moved from Florida to New York, I was able to make enough connections to get a job relatively easy. When I moved from New York to Chicago, it was not so lucky. So I settled and landed a job within about a month of my move and stayed at that job for the whole duration of my stay in Chicago. I enjoyed the city for a very long time. I've spent almost two years in Chicago and during that time I had built up a very solid bond between myself, the work I did, and the people I worked with. When I left Chicago, I did so under very stressful circumstances. I had made it clear to my manager that I was leaving for a new city and when I went to quit, she didn't care and wouldn't let me leave! I left and left for another city at the same company because I was too loyal to just quit without giving a two weeks' notice. I felt like it was the right thing to do. I left and moved",

A helicopter in the movie \"will have 'a lot of power in the cockpit.'\n\n2. 'Our team in the room will have the distinct sound of yelling.'\n\n3. A fire truck sound will be that of being pulled and the tires squealing.\n\n4. 'We will have the sound of the police department being shot at.'\n\n5. 'The door to the room will have a 'pop of air' as it opens and closing.'\n\nThis is a complete copy of the document.\n\nIn addition to using government-funded weapons and training for the movie, many of the movie's characters take part in training programs, which run the gamut from special operations to special education students and are conducted by civilian law enforcement agencies outside of the military itself.\n\nThe Hollywood executive describes a scenario he had to implement at the movie's location and even details a \"counter-coup\" that was necessary if some of the team was to make it through the movie.

So if i don’t like eleven how will i feel about thirteen? The answer is it’s a damn good third, and in fact, could be my new favourite installment in the franchise. For the fans, 13 is a must see (with a few flaws) the script is a master piece in it’s own respect and the cast are on top form with the main three in particular, really delivering the goods. ‘Ocean’s eleven’ was good fun, very enjoyable. ‘twelve’ was a bit meh. But ‘thirteen’ is what i wanted from twelve, it’s what i wanted from the franchise, a sequel that is on par with the first and delivers in style. It’s as much of an entertaining flick that you can get. it doesn’t try and reinvent the wheel. It’s the sequel that i always hoped that the series would be like but, for me, i was disappointed with both twelve and thirteen in their respective ways, and for me, the original eleven is still a damn good movie, even now, and will remain so. but now i feel like the trilogy has run it’s course and, in terms of my opinion, i am content with the series and where it ended. i couldn’t really ask for any better than thirteen to be honest. 9/10\n‘ocean’s eight’ in the works\nBy d1ezl1ff2m3n in forum General Film Discussion\n‘Ocean’s Eleven’\nBy ahsan19 in forum General Film Discussion\nRe: Review for the Movie 'Ocean's Eleven'\nBy D.B.

    "A merger of Britain's biggest railway unions should be a priority for the government, unions have been told, amid fears the plans to merge drivers and conductors are about to be unveiled. It's the largest union-management union merger in 25 years.\n\nHowever, while the government has been warned, many staff are still angry about the plans. The move was expected to be announced by the two unions on Thursday, but a final decision hasn't yet been announced.\n\nUnite and the RMT, which represent more than 40,000 train drivers and conductors, have held discussions about a possible union-management merger dating back to the summer. But the RMT wants approval of a merger it sees as crucial to the survival of its members, who remain deeply divided over management strategy and pay terms.\n\nIt is understood the unions have agreed to accept a reduced pay package from up to 16 years ago. It will also support a review of the management proposals by academics and employers' representatives to ensure they reflect the concerns of the wider workforce. But some unions, such as Unison, have voiced anger that the unions have not discussed this earlier with employees.\n\nUnison president Dave Prentis accused the government of letting the unions off the hook. \"There is no reason why these unions couldn't simply agree a higher pay deal with the company, just like the government has with hospitals and hospitals trusts. But the government is not taking a position on these pay plans and has been reluctant to do so. So it has fallen to Unite and the RMT to come to agreement on a package that will be accepted by employees and their families. But it is a matter of deep regret that the government is allowing the unions to continue to pull the wool over the public's eyes,\" he said.\n\n\nThere are only two other railway unions that merge with management firms: the General Railwayman and the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association which represents 20,000 workers.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"We expect to hear from other unions about the proposed union mergers by the end of the month.

    "The Shawshank Redemption is a remarkable film - a stirring tale of hope, friendship, and triumph of the human spirit embedded within the desolate confines of a maximum-security prison. It touches on themes that are timeless, and perhaps more relevant in our current state than when the movie was made.\n\nThe film masterfully captures the transformation of our protagonist, Andy Dufresne, played phenomenally by Tim Robbins. From a quiet banker framed for his wife's murder to an inspiring beacon of hope in the darkest corners of the Shawshank State Penitentiary, his character's journey is intriguing and captivating. \n\nMorgan Freeman is equally impressive as the seasoned inmate Ellis 'Red' Redding, whose narration adds depth and perspective to the story. The chemistry between these two characters and how their friendship unfolds over the dehumanising atmosphere of the prison is a compelling plot element. \n\nFrank Darabont's direction in this film is exceptional. The way he uses the cinematic tools at his disposal to create an oppressive prison atmosphere and contrast it with symbols of hope and freedom makes for a visually powerful movie. Thomas Newman's score envelopes the film in a cocoon of melancholic melancholy, playing into the narrative seamlessly. \n\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" isn't an easy film to watch, and it's meant to be that way. It gives audiences a grim depiction of the prison system, and yet, amidst the harsh realities it portrays, the film also promises a beacon of hope. It assures us that even in the grimmest circumstances, there can be friendship and dreams unbroken. \n\nThe ending of the film, without giving away any spoilers, strikes a perfect balance of satisfaction and joy for the viewer. It concludes an intense narrative journey with an emotionally fulfilling resolution, leaving a profound impact that lingered long after the credits rolled.\n\nIn essence, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a timeless classic that reminds us all that hope can pull us through the darkest times and that redemption is possible for everyone. It certainly deserves its status as one of the greatest movies ever made.",
    "I was not aware of this article before I wrote this statement regarding the story I had put together about the \"video game lessons\" at her school. I did not know that a story had been run by news outlets about the school. But in light of my ignorance of the details raised by this article, I now regret that I ignored it. My point was not that parents can't afford to send their kids to a private school with a tuition budget of over $50,000, but rather that the article incorrectly pointed to my statement on this issue to support the case that private schools should be required to allow children to play video games during class. I did not mean that, and I am saddened by the implications of the article.The article continues:The irony is that I was asking for this, using the school administrators' own actions in making that case. Parents have long argued that the \"playtime\" they allow during their child's school day must be limited and must cease at some point in a school day. When I wrote that, I did not mean that one could \"play a video game\" during class, I actually meant that video games must stay outside a child's \"playtime.\" The article then quotes me as saying \"but why isn't that the policy?\"It's ironic that I put it this way, since the school's policies make no mention of the concept of limits to video games (except that it shouldn't be more than 20 minutes per game, and then students must go to school, do what the rules require them to do, finish the game, and then be dismissed from the school -- none of which are defined by the policy), and the article then presents that as proof that I was urging teachers not to limit access to video games.There seems to have been some confusion about the nature of the policy. I did not say anything about not having any limits on video games, I said there should not be an overall maximum time that children could play. The policy only mentions that video games should not be \"too much time\" for a child to play.So if we're talking about \"too much time,\" what time is it? The school is saying that in the class of the students with Down syndrome, there was not only a group of 6 (10 minutes maximum for an entire day), but also a group of 7 and 8 (25 minutes maximum for an entire day).That is",
    "High-dimensional estimating equations (HEDE) have broad applications, in the domains of biomedical drug discovery, biophysical dynamics, and environmental economics. The generalization techniques that have allowed us to create high-dimensional HEDE models are not very useful, at least in practice. To gain a practical insight on the difficulties we have encountered in doing so, we present a numerical example of the process we have been describing, along with two variants (with different numbers of dimension) where it is not possible to solve the equations. We also present a proof of the completeness of the technique. Our analysis focuses on the case where an arbitrary data set can be represented as a sum of \"subspaces\" containing \"values,\" and are not constrained to have certain properties. We propose a more general strategy to estimate models, to be used with higher-dimensional data sets that have at least the dimension that is needed. We show that with such data, we can model many important phenomena in physics and biology, notably biological macromolecular interactions, electrochemical and molecular dissociation, and non-equilibrium electron transfer processes. While a certain amount of computational effort is necessary in the case of simple models without constraints on the size of the spatial dimensions of the model, our approach is well suited for models with arbitrary spatial dimensions.\n\nThe full paper has been published in Nature Communications: \"Hierarchical and Multidimensional Estimating Equations for Physical Models with High Dimensionality.\"\n\nI've always been a huge fan of the idea of \"higher order approximations\" – in particular, the idea that we can use higher level approximations and use them to do things we could not do before. There are many tools that allow us to do this in various settings, but I believe that we are about to build an algorithm called DFT with the potential (based on my own experiences with DFT and its cousins) to help give us the ability (justifiably or not) to \"take a picture\" of a problem and be able to estimate a single \"picture\" of that problem. I have been watching this potential (and I have to say I am not disappointed) with a mixture of glee and trepidation, and I'm excited to be part of the DFT effort (and excited to see what comes of it)",
    "Rugby fans across the world are calling on the Rugby Football Union to crack down on the current friendly game ban system. Over the past few weeks it has become clear that they are getting frustrated over the fact this issue has been dragging on for years. During the World Cup final in June, England played South Africa as both teams were in the midst of friendly matches and it sparked off an outpouring of rage on the subject. The English fan group 'Brugge 1834' even organised a protest with the slogan, \"If you're a friend of yours, ask yourself. Should I be in the same damn stadium with you when these boys have a laugh? Probably not. Get your friends off the streets\", in reference to England fan Danny Rose's infamous comment.\n\nThe issue was again raised last year during England's match with Ireland at Twickenham, and has been getting louder as time progresses (for instance, the Irish were forced to play in Dublin only in April 2010 because of the current ban on friendly matches).\n\nThere is no precedent for this type of ban and, as many rugby supporters have said, the current situation is unjust. It is extremely difficult to play in the same stadium as a team in another country who is playing in the world cup.\n\nWhat has happened to get the RFL to react with such severe punishments for the wrong of making a mistake?\n\nWhile the players had just won the world cup? Or did they win it without any sort of qualification under the European Championship rule-set?\n\nWhat about when the England players were playing Australia? What if they didn't have to play the game on the same day (just one month before the final)?\n\nOf course, the argument of \"you're just getting games in\" is not a good argument by any stretch of imagination.\n\nWhat the supporters should say to RFL is similar to the one they would say to any club that allows its players to go on loan against financial necessity.\n\n\"There are big clubs out there for whom the players who win the championship is far more important than whether or not they can play in a friendly or not, and what's the point of having a 'Friendly of the Year' tournament if these players are not playing against international teams?\"\n\nWhat about the clubs in England who are struggling to make a profit?",

    "*\n  \n*This paper reviews reconfigurable reflectarrays and array lenses with dynamic beam control. The basic principles and recent research progresses,\n  including their advantages and limitations, are reviewed in detail.\n  \n*Reconfigurable reflectarrays are considered as active antennas (radiating and receiving) with fully analog beam control. In addition, array\n  lenses are able to achieve fast beam control with a wide scanning range.\n\nThe paper states this further down:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Array lens is able to achieve fast beam control with a wide scanning range.\n\nAnd finally, the following source states on the bottom of page 1:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Fully digitally controlled reflect arrays (DCRAs) that can reconfigure the beam in both angular and linear dimensions can be considered as an extension of the fully analog beamforming reflect arrays (RAs).\n\n\nA: A \"reflectarray\" is an array of antennas connected to a beam former using only passive phase-shifters. All modern arrays consist of active RF (radio frequency) chains which contain phase-shifters.\n\"active antennas\" can mean a whole variety of things. For instance, antennas with phased arrays (also commonly called \"active array antennas\" or \"adaptive array antennas\") are commonly used for phased array radar and satellite communications. They consist of an array of antennas, each connected to a separate radio frequency chain consisting of phase-shifters controlled by a digital computer. This allows you to do digital beamforming on the incoming signals, so you get the ability to change the size and location of the receiving beam, as well as the direction it points.\nIn order to work, a reflectarray like this requires a signal generator or transmitter at each antenna. The signals need to be matched and then combined into one signal, and this means they need to be at the same frequency. In order to provide beamforming, the signals need to be time-aligned, and that usually means using a common frequency reference with a signal synchronized from it, or else using a special waveform which provides time-alignment as the receiver's input.\n\"Digital-controlled reflectarray\" is what would be properly termed as \"adaptive",
    "In this paper, we describe an approximate inference technique similar to the standard Bayesian inference in which we compute a posterior that is weighted by the information encoded in the vertices from which the edges were drawn (the degree-4 tree diagram). Due to the degree-4 tree diagram, the computation is exact, and gives exact results for the evaluation of these approximations. We demonstrate that this approximate inference technique can be used to evaluate approximate inference for large graph structures, and to evaluate various different approximations to the degree-4 tree diagram. We find that the weighted approximation to the degree-4 tree diagram is approximately a weighted regression, a technique employed by statisticians to estimate the probability of a distribution from the shape of the distribution.",
    "\"Watching Invictus, I kept thinking that this was like a great, powerful, stirring sports book that had been reduced to a one-hour ESPN movie. The film follows the arc of the film Mandela's life from his release from prison to the first ever interracial World Cup competition.\nThe problem is that the two hour plus movie is told in the format of an ESPN movie by jumping from match to match instead of following any matches to a conclusion or exploring the cultural impact of a match or of a tournament. By cutting short the story so many times for yet another match it actually loses its impact.\nWhat I enjoyed the most was the acting, and there were plenty of great actors to work with here. Morgan Freeman was fantastic as Mandela, and you could almost feel his age after being in prison for nearly two decades (although I always feel it's a little weird to cast Freeman when the role calls for someone black). Matt Damon was also pretty impressive.\nAnd finally, Clint Eastwood also did an amazing job. Eastwood really brought his A-game to this film, which is rather remarkable since he's done nothing since Mystic River six years ago that even faintly approaches this caliber of work.\nI also think this is very likely to be one of the five best films of 2009. It's just so well done and thought out and it has a lot of heart in it. It doesn't have the visceral power of a film like Slumdog, and it's a bit too long, but it is still a very, very fine film with great acting and an uplifting message. I give Invictus a rating of 9/10.\"\nFor more information on the movie \"Invictus,\" please visit its website at www.invictusmovie.com.\nYou can also order Clint Eastwood's \"Invictus\" on DVD.\nLabels: Clint Eastwood, Matt Damon, Morgan Freeman, new york times, New York Times Movie Review, New York Times Review, New York Times Reviews, NYT\n\"Invictus\": Best film of 2009?

    "In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization problem for learning an optimal partitioning over a set of data points based only on pairwise similarities between data points. As a result, for example, when applied to image data, the partitioning algorithm can be used in image retrieval. The proposed learning procedure is simple, fast, scalable to large datasets, and uses a margin-based loss function. We demonstrate our approach on a set of benchmarks, showing superior performance over baseline systems.\n\nIn his own publication on the subject in 2010, [17], the same person wrote,\n\nPairwise metric learning approaches that require full training data can face computational challenges when the training data is particularly large or cannot be stored in memory. To address this, Kulis _et al._ [7] introduced a set-to-set framework, and in this framework proposed a new pairwise method called LMLSS, which is able to learn from very large datasets.\n\nThis is the _only_ scholarly work that uses the term \"metric learning\", which was first used in \"Large Margin Metric Learning for High-Dimensional Data\" by Hadsell and Schütze of 2006. The only scholarly work available that uses the term \"metric space\" is _Metric learning methods for image classification_, published in 2008, in which case it was used with reference to the work of Hadsell and Schütze.\n\nSince there are so many papers devoted to what is essentially the same approach, it is a fair question to ask why one would want to pursue alternative approaches. The question arises in the papers themselves:\n\nBecause it was designed for large scale problems, the framework has several limitations in the sense that LMLSS [6] is unable to properly utilize a training set which exhibits some peculiar feature spaces. LMLSS also fails to recognize a set with a large number of similar elements. We address these limitations in this paper.\n\nI'll address some of these things later, but first I want to describe a method used to analyze the effectiveness of a given metric and then show a variety of applications where such metrics are used in real life.\n\n# A better way to compare two or multiples items in a metric space\n\nIt is not sufficient for an item to be closer in distance to a common item than to be farther away",
    "\"The best of both worlds when it comes to comedy,\" says the movie's co-writer and star, Paul Rudd, but \"sometimes you just want to make fun of things\".\n\nHe was at a screening of the movie in London on Thursday night, where he was joined by its young cast including Matt Damon, Kristen Wiig, Kate Winslet, Michael Caine and Neil Patrick Harris.\n\n\"It's not my version of a comedy,\" he says, \"but the fact that we all love it and we're all so engaged with it is an amazing thing.\"\n\nThis version of \"Aussie screwball comedy\" is in some ways less \"serious\" than the original, but Rudd feels it's still a funny film.\n\n\"I'm definitely more in the middle on this one than the first one,\" he laughs. \"I'm a bit more cynical about the world today. I don't think we've come to the point yet where we don't feel anything's funny about life.\"\n\nThis version of this idea of taking comedy and making it serious - it's an idea many of us had in our childhoods - and seeing it through an adult lens is always fun Richard Curtis\n\nHe's particularly proud of the character of Aaron Paul's character, who he sees as someone who just wants to make the world a better place.\n\n\"He's not a hero but he's trying to make the world a better place, which is a slightly different idea than it was in the first one because here there's an element of hope.\"\n\nWhen the film first premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York this year, a few people were taken aback. Some said they thought it was \"mean\". But that's how Paul Rudd sees the film now.\n\n\"We were doing our press junket in the US and people started coming up to me,\" he recalls. \"They would have questions about 'Sideways' because they thought I was very snarky.\n\n\"It was like people hadn't seen this one before and they suddenly realised it was the funniest movie.\"\n\nHe also found the film \"a lot harder emotionally to write\", making it difficult to get down on paper.\n\n\"I was always very cynical about people thinking they understood me,\" he explains.

    "A hierarchy of hierarchical attention networks has been developed, in which the model performs simple attentional selection on the feature images and a high-level model is developed to achieve greater accuracy over time. Two systems were developed, with different representations of the images (i.e. a local, hierarchical, and global) and also different learning methods (gradient descent for regional or global models and logistic regression for local models). Both regions and global models showed clear performance gains when trained with an attentional domain, whereas regions showed no advantage over global models. The results of this study demonstrate that hierarchical attention networks based on a global hierarchical model can achieve good performance while being relatively fast to train and apply, and offer additional insights into the computational mechanisms in such models.\n\nThe study was led by Michael Y. Lee at Duke's Center for Neuroimaging, \"Computational Medicine,\" and was funded by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship as part of an initiative called Project Imaging Neuroscience that seeks to promote and nurture the interdisciplinary science of brain imaging.

    "In its original version of the screenplay by Tom Cross, the plot centered on the wealthy, upper class owner of a high-end watch and jewelry store, who decided to invest 10 million dollars of his own money into the film he was working on as an independent filmmaker. As the story unfolds, two other \"Millionaires\" emerge from their homes to form a partnership to finance both the film and their start-up business. The richly conceived story of \"Slumdog Millionaire\" is a satire on the greed and corruption that surrounds the film industry, as well as a critique of the movie business as it is today. A sequel is planned, but it seems likely that the production of the film will now be left to the hands of the rich, middle-class investors who originally backed the film's project.\n\nThe author can be reached on Twitter @craigzweig or at craigzweig@mac.com",
    "The first twenty minutes of this film are great! The space ship is built in such a convincing way that it comes alive. There is a very convincing look at the stars in the sky as seen by an astronaut, and the movie makes you experience the weightlessness of space. After the first act, the movie's script falls into a tired pattern of \"meet cute\" clichés that are not especially interesting or clever. That is followed by a very poorly written love affair with Jennifer Lawrence playing a \"modern\" woman trying to have an intellectual and spiritual experience in bed with Chris Pratt playing the strong silent type. All of that is followed by a sequence that is clearly set in the future because people don't use the internet anymore! Instead, the characters play the same kind of games that people now like to play on their iPods and cell phones. In the end, the movie is so overstuffed with clichés that all of them start to cancel each other out. There is also the problem that the big twist in the story is so bad that it is no shock that it happens. It just seems like it was inserted there for the sake of injecting the movie with an action sequence that wasn't there before. (And that sequence is pretty clichéd too.)\nJodie is a bit of a conundrum for me. On one hand, her acting is always good. Her emotional ranges and physical expressions is some of the most expressive that I have ever seen on the big screen. She is clearly a talented actor with a lot of range and is not afraid to try different types of roles. She is also an excellent dancer (if you have watched her in \"Sydney White\" you know what I'm talking about!) and is a believable fighter from a martial arts perspective. She has the perfect body to play a movie actress and her beauty makes every outfit that she wears look perfect! She is also one of the few actresses that can play the bad girl and still have a certain amount of good will associated with her name. So despite all of her assets, she is still a bit of a disappointment as a movie actress. She has never been able to fully deliver a character that is truly memorable and interesting. Her characters in the \"Twilight Zone\" and in \"I Spy\" are the best examples of movies that are not memorable. They are not memorable because Jodie is",
    "The idea seems silly because we are an industry that is still in the process of forming itself, but I am starting to believe that the Masters (possibly Masters with thesis, maybe even the PhD) may be the norm, rather than the exception and this will lead to much better quality work and a better quality industry.\n\nThe evidence is this. I'm a VR Producer at a large studio in NY and I spend a lot of time meeting up with students that are just graduating from their undergraduate degrees. I'll often be interviewing somebody during their senior year or so. There is a big gap in skill between a sophomore when they start with VR, and when they end their Senior year, so hiring for junior level positions for VR isn't always practical.\n\nAt the same time, entry level jobs in the VR industry don't seem to exist, which leaves me with the impression that the industry doesn't respect people coming from an undergrad program and are often looking for people with some sort of real world work experience, and it's kind of a weird position for a lot of people looking to get their foot in the door. To get into the VR industry, companies feel like you need to be part of their VR program or you need to come with some type of actual VR experience under your belt, which doesn't always happen.\n\nBut there is a big need right now for people to step in and help. Especially here in the US. At a lot of the studios that are making these experiences, the average age is over 50. They are coming from a game making or film making background. So there is this giant issue on both the hiring and training sides of things.\n\nNow VR is a pretty young industry, so I don't want to get ahead of myself and presume that this is an inherent problem because it is. As we continue on, I'm more hopeful than ever that this will work itself out and create better opportunity for up and coming developers to learn and grow and eventually end up in a career related to VR. That said, it is important to think about what we are doing and how we are thinking about training and education for VR and what kind of educational system we need for VR developers.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Masters degree might be the next step for the VR industry. I don't know what the solution to this problem is",
    "I hope this message finds you well, especially if you're feeling down right now. The purpose of this post isn't to make your troubles disappear magically, but to remind you that it's okay to feel upset, it's okay to experience bad days. Bad days are part of life, they form the darkest threads that are essential in the creation of our life's tapestry.\n\nAlways remember that bad days are temporary. Everyone has them, and it isn't something unusual to have a rough day. Consider it an opportunity to grow, to become mentally and emotionally stronger. Sometimes, things go wrong, but that's just life testing you to unveil your hidden strength and resilience. Stand firm during those days, and when they pass, you'll emerge victorious.\n\nOn these tough days, you might think you are alone, but let me assure you, you are not. Online communities like Reddit and real-life support systems are there to share the load. Don't hesitate to reach out. Talk to someone. Express yourself. Letting it out can help you feel lighter. \n\nRemember, it's normal to be upset, feel stuck, or be dissatisfied. Acknowledge your feelings, but don't let them overpower you. Engage in things you find comforting. Maybe it's a book, a movie, relaxing music, or even a walk in the park. Pamper yourself, and more importantly, be patient with yourself.\n\nRemember, when a flower doesn't bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower itself. Similarly, if you're having a tough time, consider changing your environment or circumstances, instead of blaming yourself.\n\nLife isn't always sunshine and rainbows. It has its ups and downs. Every day is a new chapter. If today was a bad day, remember, there's always a chance for a better tomorrow. \n\nPlease, be kind to yourself. After all, you're the one who's been through everything with you. Surely there's a massive strength within you.\n\nTake care of yourself. Mental health is just as important as physical health. No storm lasts forever. Remember, sunshine follows the rain. Roll with life, and don't lose hope. Hang in there. You are so much stronger than you think.\n\nWishing you better days ahead. Take care of yourself because, when the dark clouds clear, you have a lot of happiness awaiting you out there.

    "\"This is an interesting one. It's an action movie that's all about driving, because it's got all the same elements. Well, actually more interesting elements. But the driving doesn't happen when you're actually watching movies as a character, and so the way it feels to do this is as a spectator. You know there's a real danger of ending up in a coma, of dying when driving your car as a way of life seems to be the only way to go. So this is really about trying to learn to drive so you can get away from all this.\"\n\nTo review, some plot points in \"Drive\" are as follows:\n\nA man dies during a road rally. We then follow the new owner who is a professional driver of a sports car so skilled, in fact, he drives through the rain. We watch him test his skill, and eventually prove himself a worthy owner and driver of the world's fastest (and biggest) car. We meet the other drivers and we learn about their lives and what motivates them.\n\nThis movie wasn't an action film at all, but a movie that shows the true meaning of the term, \"movies.\" We see how a movie can be a vehicle of art, of history or of pleasure.\n\nThe movie has elements of the classic thriller movie with the same old things that keep us hooked, like the mysterious characters, the thrill of being the center of attention and the suspense of knowing who the villain is.\n\nBut one part of \"Drive\" that may have the biggest impact for you is the opening scene. The scene is filled with sound, and the dialogue is crisp and detailed. In fact, the whole movie is filled with a strong presence of realism and the feel of a realistic world.\n\nWe all know that when something is realistic, the world around the story comes to life—sometimes a little too real. When you have a movie that can help us imagine the way the world would be and how our lives would play out—it's all a story. This movie does this brilliantly right up through the end.\n\nIn the movie's closing scene, a character named Nick (Michael Shannon, who is one of the three directors and also won an Oscar for making the movie) is being interviewed over his role in the movie, which was the car crash that actually ended his life.

You are not alone, I'm not trying to get you to \"leave\" or anything, I'm just a person on the inside, and I think that I may have a different perspective. I honestly have no idea if what we are seeing among certain circles is coming from a leadership issue, or if it is just a matter of a lot of people being tired of the same shit in LGBTA being said over and over again all day.

The people organizing the boycott are not the people who have the collective control. If you want to see a boycott come to fruition, you need to have the ability to directly enforce it. If the only way to enforce a boycott is to \"punch back\" at the people organizing it, then that is really only effective if you have the ability to do more damage. What I don't think is true is that when people within all of the groups involved go to bat for their cause, things seem to be progressing because as long as everyone is fighting, then you will see progress. The only way for this to happen is for people to be willing to actively support each other's causes. It is not possible for people to hold each other accountable without holding themselves accountable. 2. The group with the collective command to \"throw these people out\" is a group comprised of a few people in the past few months and does not represent the majority of the people. Most of them have not seen any positive results with their actions, and I can guarantee you that people who have seen success with these",

    "The first-time director of a feature film may find it intimidating. This is not to say that the work is not worthy of consideration; the opposite is true. As the first such film directed by a woman, Wind River is a beautiful exercise in filmmaking, and it also provides a welcome opportunity to take a moment to examine how women are being represented in movie stories.\n\nA young woman named Amber (played by Danielle Flagg) finds herself forced out of her home and into an isolated place called Red's Landing, where she is hunted by a group of criminals known as the Lutz family. In an attempt to survive, she must learn to hunt her prey and adapt to an extremely harsh wilderness inhabited by the only humans left alive.\n\nThe film is a combination of horror, drama and action, which all combine in an effort to frighten the viewer into believing that something terrible is about to occur in Red's Landing. The atmosphere of the film is unique in one respect, though: unlike most thrillers, which take place in dark, damp places, Wind River is set entirely in beautiful, sparkling, clear, green, clear water. The water is beautiful and green even during periods of rain, and unlike many other picturesque landscapes in modern movies, the water is never darkened by harsh contrasts or heavy shadows. Instead, it is saturated with the rich colors of autumn and lush green foliage; it is alive with life, even when its shoreline is covered in rock. The color of the water in that landscape is also a part of the image and is the primary part of the visual. (As if that weren't enough, the water even speaks to the film's theme of survival: the water speaks words of warning and even hints at the story at hand.)\n\nFlagg's performance in Wind River is truly special. She has great physicality and moves with a fluidity that many female characters in movies lack. In her conversation with Red (played by Taylor Sheridan) after she escapes Red's Landing, she says that she's \"never felt so alive.\" It is certainly true that many movies can be considered \"beautiful\"–and certainly many films that I've seen fall into the former category–but few films can match the sense of discovery that is felt by the audience with such regularity as movies like Wind River.\n\nThat being said, this film does have some serious issues with sexism",

They call it the \"Sun Fire spell\" to distinguish it from the common spell.\n\n\"All Dwemer artifacts are infused with the essence of the Dwemer themselves. The books that describe the spells that give these artifacts their power were never meant to be copied (they have the same magical properties and effects they had when they were originally made). To copy an artifact you would need to know the original spell. In light of this",
    "\"Scary Movie 2\", the sequel to the hit horror parody, is an incredibly raucous and often times hilariously absurd film that brilliantly pokes fun at a various collection of horror films including \"The Exorcist\" and \"Hollow Man\" to name a few.\n\nThe humour in \"Scary Movie 2\" isn't for everyone, but the completely over-the-top and ridiculous comedy style of the Wayans brothers is what makes it charming. The ensemble cast, featuring Anna Faris, Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans and several others, perform admirably in their roles - all bringing an animated charisma that complements the ludicrous on-screen scenarios.\n\nWhile the plot of \"Scary Movie 2\" is a bit senseless (but then again, it's not meant to be a serious movie), the pace keeps the audience's interest alive with its non-stop wave of laugh-out-loud moments. The parodies and cultural references embedded within the film are pure genius, and watching the movie more than once helps unravel even more of these comedic gems.\n\nAlthough the level of comedy in this movie is pretty coarse and crude, it definitely has its own charm. The gross-out humour might be off-putting for some, but it's a crucial element that shapes the unique identity of the \"Scary Movie\" franchise.\n\nThe visual effects might not be ground-breaking but remember, this is a mockery film that doesn't require the gloss and glamour of high-end production. In fact, the semi-cheap aesthetics somehow add another layer of comedy to the overall viewing experience.\n\nOverall, if you’re a fan of slapstick and outrageously crude comedy or a lover of horror movie parodies, then \"Scary Movie 2\" is definitely a must-watch film. Obviously, this isn't a movie meant to move hearts or provoke profound thoughts. Rather, it's a wild, raucous ride meant purely for laughs, and in that, it delivers in spades.",
    "\"Well-behaved children are the best protected from violent attacks and, especially, from death. This, in fact, was the case until 2001 when The New York Times reported that one in every five children killed in the U.S. occurred when they were home alone.\" [i]\n\nLet's take a quick look at the study and then I'll discuss it in detail.\n\nThe study and \"New York Times\"\n\nThe New York Times article in question was published in late January, 2001, entitled \"More Murders in the Home: A Report by the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice at Rutgers University\". The study that The Times referred to was called \"A Growing Crisis in US Home Invasions\" and was submitted this summer to the National Institute of Justice.\n\nThe methodology of the paper, conducted by a professor named Susan Loman of the Rutgers Criminology Department, was based on interviews with over 250 victims of violent attack that was reported to her office from 1987 to 1998. It consisted of four parts. The first section consisted of questions intended to figure out if an assault really occurred; the second part of the questionnaire focused on the victim's experience with the household; this part of the questionnaire was based on a similar questionnaire that Loman had completed during an earlier decade and answered the same questions that the survey respondents had to answer; and the third section of the questionnaire was meant to figure out how much time elapsed from the time that the attack had been reported to the time when it had occurred. The fourth part of the questionnaire was in-depth; it included the questions to measure the victim's feelings after the attack, the type of weapon, whether the attacker had been male or female, whether the victim lived alone or with a partner, and how the perpetrator looked, if any. Loman, the author notes, used a standard methodology and she used it extensively. And she also decided to do this survey as soon as it became politically expedient. Loman says the survey was \"the first attempt to systematically address the problem\". [ii]\n\nThe main focus of the paper, which you can read here [iii] (link opens in new window), is how to distinguish between a home or dwelling attack, in which the householder was either involved or a bystander and which involved a relatively minor act of violence.

    "M*A*S*H* is probably the best of the many Vietnam War movies. Sure, many people have seen Full Metal Jacket, but very few have sat through the whole thing. Of course, there are always exceptions. So now for the review.\nFirst off, this movie is not a comedy. If you haven't seen the trailer or cover, then you are going to be very disappointed with this film. There are only three major comedic events in the movie: two occur at the beginning, and only one occurs near the end.\nThis movie takes place during the Vietnam War, and revolves around the lives of three doctors in a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. For the most part, this film follows Hawkeye and Trapper from the episode, \"Hawkeye.\" They are the two principal characters throughout the whole movie, and I think that M*A*S*H could be considered as a combination of the five different movies and the one tv series. This is not a biography on Hawkeye or Trapper, but more on Klinger, The Colonel, Captain \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan, Father Francis, Radar, Charles, Frank Burns, The Swamp, Trapper, and of course, Hawkeye.\nMASH is an excellent movie, and I honestly think that it is the best of all of the Vietnam War movies, including the TV miniseries. Yes, I think this is a better film than Apocalypse Now (at least the miniseries and not the whole film), Missing in Action I & II, and Platoon. For instance, when I first saw Apocalypse Now, I thought it was a great film. Then I saw Platoon, and I thought that it was as good as Apocalypse Now. Later on, I saw Missing In Action (the first one only) and I thought it was pretty good. I guess the best comparison of Missing In Action is to the first Platoon. I saw M*A*S*H and was highly impressed. I can't compare it to the other films because I haven't seen them, but I can tell you that this film is very special.\nM*A*S*H has its funny moments, but unlike some movies, it is not a comedy. One good laugh in the whole film occurs at the end. There are no major battle scenes",
    "Ahsoka Tano, Anakin's apprentice during the Clone Wars? Many Star Wars fans know her at a surface level through the animated series, but she's an incredibly complex and important character in Star Wars lore. \n\nBorn on the planet Shili, she was discovered by Jedi Master Plo Koon at a very young age. Trained by Master Yoda, she had the potential of becoming an extremely powerful force user. However, fate had other plans for her. \n\nDuring the Clone Wars, she became Anakin's Padawan, under Master Yoda's direction. She was strong-willed, fiercely independent, and at times, impulsively brave, reminiscent of her Master. Her character development from an annoying kid to a seasoned warrior is one of the most underrated journeys in the Star Wars universe.\n\nShe found herself wrongfully accused of a terrorist bombing on the Jedi Temple, which led to one of the darkest times in her life. Being abandoned by the Jedi Council and hunted by the Republic, she managed to uncover the truth and expose the real culprit.\n\nDespite proving her innocence, she made a hard decision of walking away from the Jedi Order, disillusioned by their actions. This was a significant blow to Anakin, understandable considering the paternal bond they had developed. \n\nHer decision to leave the Order set her on a unique path. She became a citizen of the galaxy, no longer beholden to the Jedi or their dogmatic views, but still committed to ideals of justice and protection of the innocent.\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that her character offers us an insight into Anakin’s transition to the dark side. Anakin lost his faith in the Jedi Order partially because of how they had treated Ahsoka. She was his 'little Snips', could have been the only one able to save him from Darth Sidious, but the Order took that chance out of her hands.\n\nAhsoka's journey is one of the most poignant, carrying as much weight as the story of Anakin or Luke. She's the biggest legacy of the Clone Wars, representing resilience, hope, and redemption. One who found herself toe-to-toe against Darth Vader, her former master. \n\nShe's a character worth exploring, and I can't wait to see more of her, hopefully in the upcoming Star Wars series. After all, In A Galaxy Far, Far Away, there's more to the story than just the Skywalkers.",

We need to see the glass as being half-full rather than half-empty. Most of the things we complain about are caused by our attitudes. For example, our cars are full of useful technologies but we complain about them. 3) We can choose our priorities. Some things are better than others, for us personally. Our bodies, for example, come first, or whatever we care about. Everything else will come after, whether it's money, power or whatever. 4) We need to relax. As long as we are alive, there's always a way out. There's always a way to achieve our dreams. There's never a way to achieve perfection. 5) We need to find purpose. We need to think about why we're here. We are here to love. We are here to give and receive love and care.

    "Introduction\n\nAsymmetric dual-front models (ADMs) are the most common techniques used to generate large-scale image features using an ensemble of ADMs. ADMs, first developed by Shlomi Fish (Fish 2000, Fish 2003), have been applied in many cases for image segmentation including segmentation of faces and objects and for image matching (Hemminki et al. 2007, 2008). On the other hand, ADMs are typically not suitable for real-life photo-recognition tasks because their size can drastically limit their effective dimensionality. In this paper, we build up on this difficulty with an ADM based on an ADM of asymmetries with a low-dimensional, unsupervised feature space. Our ADM features are similar to human-classified faces but include features for a wide variety of classes of features, including a large set of natural features. We address the following issues:\n\nCan an ADM of asymmetries be trained directly with any existing human classification system?\n\nCan there be non-linear discriminability in ADMs?\n\nHow accurate can ADMs be when trained without learning labels?\n\nCan we perform class-based training for ADMs?\n\nCan we use single-class ADMs directly in ImageNet?\n\nHere is a picture taken from the presentation of this research paper on ARCHE 2015 (see the full paper here).\n\nA Generalized Asymmetric Dual-Front Model for Active Contours and Image Segmentation\n\nIn fact, the ADM we build here has a training procedure that is completely different from most other ADMs. It does not focus on predicting binary class labels like the ones in ADMs. Instead with the \"ADMs as features\" approach, ADMs are trained as feature vectors, which enable us to use ADMs directly in ImageNet. The features include the human-classified features from our study. The ADMs we build here can also be applied even to face- and object-class objects, because we use unsupervised \"face feature vectors\" and \"object feature vectors\" as training input. These feature vectors are obtained from a large set of features from each face and object that we have labeled, and have been labeled by our research group.",

    "UK Home Secretary Charles Clarke is set to unveil a new comprehensive immigration policy, aimed at controlling the rising number of immigrants in the country. The plan will outline the government's strategy to deal with immigration issues that have been a prominent public concern over the last few years. \n\nThe major points of the new immigration plan are expected to be a clampdown on the number of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, an increased focus on the merit-based immigration system, and ramped-up efforts to expel illegal migrants convicted of crimes. The plan will also reveal measures to tackle the alleged education visa fraud.\n\nThe government's latest move comes in response to the widely held public sentiment that the UK's immigration policy is too lax, has been exploited by numerous immigrants, and that overall numbers should be curbed to better manage public resources.\n\nThe Home Secretary, according to sources, could also use this opportunity to clarify the government's stance on quotas for legal immigration. However, critics argue that setting quotas may not be a panacea to all immigration issues, and it could negatively impact the economy.\n\nImmigration has divided opinion in the UK, making it a hot topic in recent political debates. Many people believe that it is an important source of skills and labour needed for the betterment of the UK's economy, while others feel that excessive immigration places an undue burden on public services and leads to increased crime rates.\n\nMr Clarke's imminent announcement comes amidst a rising wave of anti-immigration sentiments and increasing pressure from opposition parties for tougher immigration control.\n\nThe proposed new policy aims to find a balance between welcoming immigrants who can contribute to the UK's economy and society, and managing resources to handle those who, according to the government, \"abuse\" the immigration system.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the new plan will be received, and whether it will address all the relevant concerns related to this complex, sensitive issue. Meanwhile, refugee and immigrant rights groups are keenly waiting for the specifics of the plan, concerned about the potential impact on families and communities who have made the UK their home. \n\nMr Clarke is expected to provide further details about the plan in the House of Commons later this week.",

And while there is no denying the inherent appeal of the classic \"boy meets girl\" story, it can also lead to a certain type of sappy cliches, if done poorly.\nI can almost immediately tell when a movie is going to do this, and I know I'll end up cringing throughout. The screenwriter knows when to insert jokes, how the leads will interact, and when they need to realize they are in love. But when they get it right, they really get it right.\n\"Notting Hill\" seems to be one of those rare romcoms that is able to take a cliche story and really make it its own. In the hands of an unskilled writer, I can see this film's flaws, its similarities with other films in this genre. But the skill of the actors, director, writers and producers were able to take a somewhat familiar situation and make it their own, without having to rely on cheap jokes, cliched characters, or silly subplots.\nThis was one of those films where the actors really made it all their own, by going that extra step to make the film more than just words on a page. And to that end, the cast was great. Julia Roberts, so often thought of as a beauty without substance, really showed another side of what she can do, even if she has never been what one would consider a great actor.\nEccentricity is what she does best, and this movie shows she can do it really well.

    "For experiments designed to investigate the effect of the number and configuration of simulation components on the results of the simulation, a new package, \"tcpvkd\", was written in Perl. The package gives access to an interactive TCP/IP TCP simulation called \"dune-cpv\". The results of the simulation can then be stored in a table and presented in a visualization tool on a terminal. Because of the open nature of the TCP ports in that simulator, an external program (in this case \"dune-cpv\") can be called to send its own packets to the simulated port. The main advantage of this model over those used by other simulations is that many additional resources (tcp socket and database for communication between simulator and host) are only needed when the server is run on a particular host. On the other hand, for each individual simulated connection, only a \"network clock\" is required.\n\nThe following is an example from a report describing the results of a simulation which can be downloaded from http://scottbarracudae.com/dune/dune0v2-net-clock.pdf:",
    "“Attractors, or points in the space that attract states of the system into their vicinity, are of fundamental importance to the behavior of many dynamical systems. A prominent class of attractors for dynamical systems are fixed points, which are points that attract orbits of a continuous dynamical system into their vicinity. Here, we consider dynamical systems with a discrete time step whose states are governed by functions mapping a real-valued parameter and an internal state to an internal state. This class of dynamical systems includes systems frequently used to describe biological networks, in which a network of species is described by iterating a function that depends on a parameter and the internal state. For example, in the “Ott-Antonsen-function” for metabolic networks, the function representing each species involves the species’ current level and a parameter which is a time-dependent mass balance for this species. In this case, the parameter represents the current resource intake for growth and maintenance of the cells, and the internal state is the species’ current level in the network. For the Ott-Antonsen network, the fixed points correspond to the metabolically optimal states, in which the resource uptake is precisely as much as it is sufficient for maintaining the species’ level. However, it is much more than is required to maintain only the optimal fixed point. We study the influence of the parameter’s value on this behavior. We consider a specific example for a small signaling network and derive analytic expressions as well as estimate the effect numerically using Gillespie simulations. We find that for parameters that are too large, the system can exhibit multiple stable limit cycles. For each such set of parameters, the network can be characterized as having several attractors: the stable fixed points, which can also be unstable limit cycles for parameters within this set, as well as unstable limit cycles that are unstable fixed points for other parameters within this set. If the parameter is too small, the system can exhibit oscillations between two attractors that are stable fixed points for lower and higher values of the parameter, respectively. Our analysis helps characterize the existence of stable and unstable fixed points as well as unstable limit cycles within a network. We discuss the possible impacts of variations in the resource availability on different network components due to this behavior and highlight the importance of the network’s parameter in designing and interpreting experiments on biological networks.”\nThe following is",
    "\"Molecular motors enable the self-assembly of amphipathic protein-like structures, which generate a wide variety of force-carrying forces. A key principle of amphipathicity in these structures is that the hydrophobic side is strongly oriented away from the membrane, whereas the hydrophilic side is biased to the plane of the membrane. Here we demonstrate that amphipathic peptides can be controlled to rotate and stretch in a conformational direction independent of the direction of membrane curvature, and that the direction of rotation can be controlled and altered by the presence of hydrophobic residues. In particular, amphipathic peptides with short amino acid tails, such as those from Drosophila melanogaster, can be transformed into amphipathic structures by providing hydrophobic residues such as the conserved β-turn to the protein backbone. These amphipathic structures can be used in a number of approaches to protein-protein docking and docking control.\"\n\nSo we had a pretty good understanding of what we were dealing with at the very beginning, which is that the peptides in the molecules have a large degree of flexibility, but they are mostly water-based. So, they are not going to take water or anything that would help this side of the molecule slide around. This is the major problem that we found. A lot of these ligand binders have some water, and we could see that the molecules would go around it just fine. The same problem has arisen in the domain containing the two arms of the receptor [2]. So we started out thinking that it wouldn't be a problem to have the domains attached in a way that didn't force the molecule around the water-receptor. That was our approach. How can you have a hydrophobic domain on the molecule on the molecular level and not force water on the side of the molecule that slides around? At the same time, how can you have a hydrophilic domain on the molecule and not force water on the side of the molecule that slides around? So it's very difficult to do, basically these two domains are attached in a very rigid way, and they bind to each other very rigidly, and they push against each other in two different directions. So these domains have a lot of repulsion at the center",

Thus, the output of the network can be processed in different ways depending on the input of these non-overlapping layers.\n\nA total of 64 hidden units in each layer are connected using the full network in a manner that allows all the connections to be reused. Each of the channels can be configured to hold either one or two parameters, for example, the one-hot encoding encoding (1) has a parameter that specifies which hidden unit should be used for training, while the other (2) parameter indicates that the hidden unit should be used for evaluation, for example, its accuracy is determined from the value of the hidden unit's outputs, while its bias-variance ratio (BVAR) is computed over all its input data.\n\nThe two parameters (x and y) are specified in C code, where x is a one-hot variable that specifies the value of the input to an edge in a hidden layer, and y is a two-hot variable that specifies the value of a channel.\n\nHere is a diagram of a CompNet: The first layer is an activation function whose output value is represented by a one-hot C code. Each layer (and the input and output of layer) has its own activation function and each",

    "This paper investigates the two-dimensionalization process of low-magnetic-Reynolds-number flows in the presence of a strong magnetic field. It presents results from numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, confirming that the low-magnetic-Reynolds number flows subject to strong magnetic field become exactly two-dimensional if the magnetic field is infinitely strong. The theory is supported by numerical simulations of several standard problems in magnetohydrodynamics. The findings potentially provide new grounds for understanding the behavior of various astrophysical and terrestrial fluid motions driven by magnetic fields, with implications for improving simulations in magnetohydrodynamics.",
    "My parents watched \"A Bug's Life\" together more times than I can remember - I have a box of VHS boxes from that era sitting on our countertop in the kitchen. They both had an affection for the children's show that was more than the crude humor. If the jokes were crude, it was only to be expected. The film is about Andy, whose childhood is more miserable than the other family members. Andy has no friends, who treat him as a freak and he ends up in a foster home in the middle of the desert. Andy's life gets a little better the day he meets Sally, whose family has a big, old, fancy house. The only thing that makes Andy's life better is Sally's family, and a few days later he's married to her. Sally is the \"mama\" and Andy is the \"papa.\" Sally's brother-in-law, Ralph, treats Andy much better. He makes Andy his \"favorite meal\", and he keeps Andy happy. When Andy learns that he has a sister, named Sally, the family starts a very expensive, fancy, but failed, campaign to get her into college. They go on a nice trip to Las Vegas, but it ends up with a fight at a Las Vegas strip club and the family flees. It is later revealed that they were trying to rob a safe containing money, jewels and some of their kids. They are caught, but all the kids were saved. Andy is released from jail on parole, and he returns to the desert to his life where he is a failed musician and his life is falling apart. When he learns that Sally has been killed by the robbers and he learns that she didn't know the robbers were after her, he heads back to the desert and takes out another hit on them.\n\nThe \"mama\"/\"papa\" duo is not the same characters as the first film. Andy was more of a sidekick to the parents. Here they are portrayed as close best friends. Andy's sister Sally is introduced when Andy finally gets his sister back. Andy was trying to steal money, jewels and his kids, but there is a twist. Andy is trying to steal the money from his sisters. Sally is the main person that saves Andy. Sally was a very special person in Andy's life and was always looking on for help and advice. I think that Sally was not",

    "The Orphanage is a great film that is almost impossible to fully convey in review, not just for its subject matter, but because of the many different ways it is conveyed. I have no idea how this movie was able to win a few Oscars this year. In fact, I suspect this is in part because it's so unique. We're treated to a great performance here by the ever-gorgeous Sally Hawkins as the mother of a troubled boy, who just happens to know the dark history of the orphanage he lives in. This film is not just an extremely important film, it's an incredible one, and a very unique film.\n\nThe movie is an absolute delight. It's a short movie. It's very fun to watch. There are a lot of characters, and some really good acting. It has an amazing ending that we won't get into here, but it's one of the most beautifully executed endings ever written for a film. It features a lot of great visuals, a very well written script, and some great characters, although they are mostly unvoiced.\n\nBut this is only half of the story. This movie has such a rich and unique world all to itself that it's easy to see it through different perspectives. The Orphanage can be viewed not just as an interesting narrative, but as a world itself, or a piece of an ongoing cycle, rather than as just a one-shot story. I like to read that one of the reasons the movie won awards was because of how well it tells the story using the medium of visual storytelling. It's a lot like seeing a painting rather than reading it.\n\nI won't go on a long lecture about why this movie is so great, and it's not because I'm some critic from the 80s who was too young to watch a lot of movies, because there are too many to cite. I'll just say that for anyone who cares, the world of The Orphanage is very well researched, very well made, and very well acted, especially when you factor in the performances of Sally Hawkins and the movie's star Jeremy Davies.\n\n-David Cawthorne\n\nAdvertisements",

    "The sensor location problem arises in numerous domains including, but not limited to, security applications and logistics. When formulated precisely, the problem has been shown to be non-convex, both computationally challenging and, in extreme cases, not even solvable. Yet, in practice, one would like to find effective algorithms producing \"reasonably good\" solutions with acceptable computation times. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with appropriate algorithmic parameters, the simulated annealing algorithm (a type of \"metaheuristic\" algorithm) can find good solutions to the general sensor location problem within reasonable computation times. We then describe an appropriate relaxation of the general sensor location problem that can be analyzed and shown to be both computationally easy to solve and to produce effective solutions.\n\nIf you are interested in this research paper, you can read it for free (well, if you don't mind reading from a computer screen instead of paper) on arxiv.org.

    "\"The Lost City of Z could be a great film, but instead is a rather lackluster period piece with a couple of good performances from Charlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson. The real problem with The Lost City of Z lies within the lack of any focus and the fact that it really has no idea what point it wants to make about the story it tells. The Lost City of Z doesn't so much attempt to tell a real story as it does to hit the bullet points. It's like reading a Wikipedia page. Nothing in the film moves; it's all exposition and it all seems to rush by you as you get confused trying to keep track of every character, back-story, location, and timeline.\nThe Lost City of Z at the end of the day is an average biopic because of the aforementioned reasons. Though I'm sure the real characters were real people, it's hard to tell them from one another when they're portrayed so badly on screen.\n\"The Lost City of Z\" is now playing in a few theaters in the South Bay, such as Century 20 Daly City.\nWhat is the movie rating?\nThis movie is rated R (for violence, adult content, some drug use and brief language).\nReview of documentary \"The Jihadists Next Door\"\nBy Jana J.

    "I recently started a new account in the game, and going against mid-wipe and late-wipe players as a new player has been incredibly difficult. The gear discrepancy is massive, and I often find my gameplay experience is inferior due to going up against veteran players who have all the high-end gear.\n\nFor instance, I barely stand a chance against a player who has been grinding for missions and loots all wipe. Their weapons and armor tier outclass mine, and they're more familiar with the map intricacies, the loot spots, and spawn points. This means they can land better shots earlier and take advantage of the map to get the upper hand in any confrontations we have.\n\nIn this light, the late-wipe meta really doesn't favor new or 'casual' players. I understand that it's an integral part of the game to advance and get better gear, but the stark disparity between veteran and newbie players makes the game play feel unbalanced and somewhat discouraging.\n\nI'd like to suggest a tier-based matchmaking system that factors in a player's gear or some way of making it more balanced. This way, new players will be paired with others of similar experience and gear, making the matches more competitive and enjoyable. \n\nI am curious as to what the community thinks about this. Do you too find the late-wipe phase difficult as a lower-level player? Do you have any other suggestions to make gameplay more balanced, fair, and enjoyable for all?

    "France's economy weakened in the fourth quarter of 2014, according to official figures on Thursday. The eurozone's second-largest economy shrank 0.1% on-year in the final three months of 2014, as consumption and private consumption fell. Gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 1.9% in 2013. Consumer spending continued its downward slide, shrinking by 0.2%. And private consumption, which had accounted for the bulk of France's growth in prior years, was flat in the fourth quarter as a share of GDP. Retail sales, an indicator of consumer spending, fell by 0.1%. French business investment contracted 1.3% during the fourth quarter of 2014, and was the lowest since the second quarter of 2003.\n\nThe news article further notes,:\n\nThe French prime minister, Manuel Valls, last night sought to explain the weak statistics, saying the figures needed to be treated \"with caution\". \"The results should be treated with caution, but there is no doubt that they are an important indicator for the state of the French economy at the end of 2014,\" Mr Valls said. The government will unveil Friday a €300bn bailout for the European Union and International Monetary Fund on the back of the figures, which the finance ministry said \"are clearly not in line with our calculations which predicted a healthy recovery in GDP during 2014\".\n\nThe IMF does not appear to have a \"threshold of growth for its forecast\". In their official mission report the IMF describes their \"current view\" on the French economy as follows:\n\nFrance is likely to regain sustainable growth in 2015 and remain in growth mode through 2017.\n\nThe IMF's \"estimate\" on France's current account balance is that current account payments will peak at 2.5% of GDP in 2014. In August, IMF Director Christine Lagarde stated, that economic growth in France would grow by 1% in 2015. On August 9, 2014, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde reiterated that the IMF expects \"economic reform to deliver strong results in the medium term\".",
    "(the full text of any of my reviews of this type can be seen by scrolling to the bottom of this page.)\n\"Yesterday, an intimate ensemble comedy that features an endearing performance by actor/first-time director Richard Linklater and an inventive story by screenwriter Matthew Broderick (star of the \"Godfather\" trilogy), presents a thought-provoking examination into the question of identity and the possibility that one could lead a perfectly contented life if the whole world believed something different from it.\nThe film opens with Jack, an independent musician living in New York City, in the midst of a creative funk that finds him in desperate need of inspiration. For the past six weeks, he has lived a life of quiet desperation, and is on the verge of abandoning his music for a career in retail.\nOne night, Jack is struck by a bus driven by his best friend Nigel, and while he recovers in the hospital, an alien from outer space named Yorrick (Bennet Omalu), who has a head full of songs and the ability to make them appear real, befriends Jack and gifts him with an entire catalog of songs that the rest of the world will never hear.\nYorrick explains that for the past 12 years, he has traveled throughout the world, collecting the music of a thousand different cultures, all of which have been erased from history. He then gives Jack the complete musical catalog, and invites him to accompany him in bringing the songs of the world to new audiences everywhere. Thus, Jack is able to create the illusion that he's writing the music himself, becoming a worldwide musical sensation, but at the risk of losing the people he cares about and the one thing he really wants. What's a struggling musician to do?\nThe biggest problem with this film is that it is all too obvious from the outset that everything will turn out OK in the end as Jack \"saves his art\" and the happy relationship with his girlfriends and friends is preserved. The movie is basically a series of humorous and sometimes-funny scenes that tell a story that in the end is predictable to anyone but the most naive and innocent of audiences. The best way to get through the film is to look past any question of whether the movie is trying to put forward a meaningful point and just enjoy the scenes and the moments. I found the scenes with Jack and Y",
    "\"Blade\" is an indisputably potent cocktail of the horror and action genres, embodied in the riveting performance of Wesley Snipes as the titular character. What sets \"Blade\" apart is its esoteric blend of gritty horror elements with action sequences that could rival any pure action film. \n\nSnipes proves himself a tour-de-force, perfectly capturing the brooding intensity and badassery of his character. He provides a sort of dramatic heft and gravitas seldom seen in a comic-based film. In every fight scene, he displays a level of skill and physicality that totally immerses you in his world. His portrayal of Blade can only be described as a landmark in the comic book turned film adaptations.\n\nStephen Norrington, the director, also deserves credit for maintaining the film’s feverish, grimy atmosphere, giving the audience a postmodernist gothic noir. The hybridized urban landscape filled with a foreboding sense of dread is a character in itself.   \n\nThe plot, while not groundbreaking, admirably propels the film forward. It manages to maintain an appropriate balance between fast-paced action sequences and the development of a larger, more sinister world surrounding our anti-hero. It also infuses the right amount of class conflict and racial tension to stimulate intellectual interest.\n\nOn the downside, \"Blade\" does show some lack of depth in its character development. The antagonists do not make an intellectual match for Blade somewhat stifling the dramatic tension. Furthermore, the script sometimes dips into predictability. Yet these gaps do not overshadow the overall entertainment derived from the film.\n\nThe choreography of fight sequences is brilliantly enthralling, augmented by effective use of cutting-edge special effects that were groundbreaking in their time. The stylistic intellect used in shooting the action scenes is par excellence and provides major thrills.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Blade\" is a standout in the superhero genre, with a unique take on the vampire mythos. Its amalgamation of horror and action, grounded by Snipes' performance, makes it a memorable watch. While not perfect, it stands as a testament to how flexible comic book adaptations can be and leaves us craving for more of Blade's ventures in his dark world.",

    "IMDb user review: 3.5 out of 5 stars\nFace Off (1997) is probably the first really memorable film that John Woo came over to direct after making the hit \"Hard Target,\" and I personally think it is as good and in some ways it is the better of the 2 films...\nDirected by: John Woo (with Jeffrey W. Chan directing second unit action scenes)\nStars: John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Joan Allen, Gina Gershon\nPlot: Nick Parker (Nicolas Cage) is a brilliant criminal psychologist who is being held prisoner in a mental institution to keep him from revealing secrets. Sean Archer (John Travolta) is a professional thug, trained by the U.S. military to be an assassin, who now works for whoever pays him the most. The 2 are being interrogated and studied by Dr. Wilbur Riveaux (Joan Allen) as a way of figuring out their criminal psyches. Riveaux takes both men out of their cells for the night, lets them share a cell and sets them up to compete to see who is the better man, the better thinker. She leaves Nick some rope with which to attempt suicide and Archer a loaded gun so that the 2 can compete to see who will survive the experience. But...there are twists and turns as they test each other and attempt to manipulate each other, the other's environment and Riveaux's beliefs and emotions and to discover each other's weaknesses.\nI really don't understand why so many people think of John Woo's best works as all about the violence when Woo's films have always worked on many levels. In fact, this film is one of the most layered and complex of his films, exploring the theme that even the best of people, when pushed, can lose all that makes them human. I love this film because it actually makes you think. I love that it is a sort of parable of human nature that reveals the dark depths that all of us have and how we react once we are removed from the social and ethical pressures that make up the \"normal\", civilized world. It also touches on the nature of what makes us human and how far we will go for freedom and for survival. I love the layers and how the film shifts back and forth between being a thriller, then a drama, then a thriller again",
    "\"From Dusk Till Dawn\" is an anarchy-filled joyride that combines elements of road-trip flicks, crime capers, vampire movies, and 70's grindhouse into one memorable film. Directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino, their collaborative passion for over-the-top characters, dialogue, and bloodshed is evident throughout.\n\nThe film starts as an explosive crime thriller, following the unpredictable Gecko brothers (played by George Clooney and Tarantino himself), two fugitives blazing a trail towards the Mexican border. Clooney delivers a charismatic performance as the level-headed outlaw struggling to control his volatile brother. Tarantino, on the other hand, spins a chilling performance as a sociopath.\n\nTheir journey takes an unexpected left turn when they cross paths with a family of faith-challenged characters traveling in a motor home portrayed brilliantly by Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, and Ernest Liu. When both groups converge at an isolated bar, the movie suddenly switches gears and plunges headlong into sheer vampire horror. This abrupt shift from crime saga to supernatural story may disorient some viewers, but for those who appreciate the art of genre-mixing, it is a refreshing change of pace.\n\nFeaturing a colorful cast of characters including Cheech Marin in multiple roles, Salma Hayek as the seductive vampire queen, and Tom Savini as the memorably-named Sex Machine each elevates \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" far above your average horror flick. Dynamic camera work, chilling makeup effects, and a toe-tapping rock soundtrack, bring Rodriguez’s raw and visceral directorial style to life.\n\nThe dialogue is quintessential Tarantino: snappy, stylish prose laced with pop-culture references and a dash of dark humor which help to keep the tension bearable during the movie's more intense sequences.\n\nHowever, \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" is not a movie for everyone. It is violent, bloody, and disturbing at times. It isn't a movie that takes itself seriously, and in fact, indulges in its own outrageousness. Admittedly, it does have flaws. Some of the CGI could have aged better, and the pacing could be uneven. Yet, those don't significantly diminish the film's overall appeal.\n\nTo sum it up, \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" is a roller-coaster ride that dwells on an entirely different level of twisted creativity. It's a fantastic fusion of distinctive Tarantino dialogue with traditional Rodriguez action, culminating in a movie that effectively challenges the boundaries of conventional genre",
    "**The Woman in Black**\n\nDirected by James Watkins • Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Ciarin\n\nMorgan • Produced by Crosscreek Pictures, Film4 Productions\n\n• Official Website: womaninherblack.com\n\nAs a writer and as a horror film enthusiast, I was intrigued by both the success of the original book, and the fact that after the success of the Harry Potter books and movies, the role of Harry Potter was given to Daniel Radcliffe to play. It was interesting, watching the movie, to make the comparisons of this role to the role in which Daniel Radcliffe is probably the most recognized.\n\nThe story itself was compelling, and it had so many aspects of the gothic and horror that was so popular from the end of the eighteenth century, into the 1800s, and up well until the 1960s or so. Perhaps the genre is about to be rediscovered as a popular form in film, in this time when we as a society seem to have forgotten how to appreciate the art of horror. This movie reminded me of the kind of suspense, building up from the beginning, and in this respect, it was quite comparable to the original version of _Psycho_. It was also the role that reminded me of this, as we saw the man, Arthur Kipps, who had recently been married, but after finding it difficult for him to settle down with his bride, had decided to go away for a few days, to a place as far away as possible, to help him put things in perspective and calm down. His friends in the village were encouraging, with one in particular who offered to send Kipps the horse and carriage for Kipps to go to the area where he wished to go.\n\nOnce at the place, the audience is shown the house that Kipps is staying at, and from the beginning we come to know that something is very wrong with the household. The family are very strange, almost to the point of being unnerving. Kipps is given a bed to stay in and he feels uneasy about where this will be, and he is right, because after a series of strange occurrences, he realizes that this bed is the same one in which his replacement slept, and was the same bed that his replacement woke from a night before, and which he, of course",
    "So, you know Alberius is pretty cool in his own right. For those of us who've been looking at him this whole time, the comparisons came up on a random search today. It turns out that Alberius and Euden were rivals in the early days of the Fettuccine Crisis. When Ganneth and others tried to convince the other clans to switch alliances to Fettuccine, Euden wasn't interested and he tried to take the other clans out. Ultimately, Alberius stepped in to stop him. Euden took the other clans' stuff, threw a rock, and got thrown back. The rock hit him in the face. Alberius, now known as one of the most powerful Fettuccine in the game, died shortly afterward or shortly before. Euden died of shame, a little bitter from losing a fight in a very public arena. I'm a bit surprised that many people seem to give Euden a free pass.\n\nI was wondering about that comment yesterday when I stumbled onto it today and was able to determine a bit more. Euden was the first of the major Fettuccine leaders to rise to prominence within the Fettuccine Rebellion, and he played a pivotal role in the conflict — so much so that Ganneth, the man who helped to lead out the Fettuccine Rebellion, actually tried to have the two locked up in the same prison as enemies. In the end, however, both were let free but the two had strong feelings about Euden's actions, and Euden believed it was his duty to take him down.\n\nAccording to some history shared between Fettuccine on reddit and from a book on the Fettucin Rebellion by David C. Hopkinson, Euden went so far as to give Alberius' face as a prize with a warning to the other Fettuccine leaders not to try to imitate him (this is where Euden gets his moniker, \"Eidun\"). However, Alberius wasn't interested in going down in flames, believing the end of the Euden and Alberius feud had been a success. Thus, the two locked horns one final time. It's unclear whether in this final battle, the one Euden lost, Orgaz was involved. The only other known Fettuccine battle where the Or",

These retinal cell populations represent both photoreceptor and non-photoreceptor cells. Some more pictures demonstrating this for the human brain are shown below. In the previous image, a single photoreceptor cell has been moved to the center of the retina: [link]\n\nBelow are three of the brain regions where we can see this phenomenon: The left side of the brain represents the cerebrum, the middle, the caudate nucleus, and the right side represents the hypothalamus (shown below). The cerebrum contains about 8% of the total brain and we can see that as we move from right to left we are looking at fewer photoreceptor cells. The remaining 90% of the brain is composed of areas like the thalamus, the hippocampus, and the cortex.",
    "The proposed distance metric is a simple linear one-dimensional normalization technique based on the Euclidean distance between objects and a number of other objects in the system. While Euclid's law is a useful starting point for distance analysis, a more accurate distance metric can be derived if the following restrictions are made to the data:\n1. The geometric distance is defined only for the coordinate system of the analysis.\n2. The distance metric is assumed to be linear, i.e., between any pair of objects in the system as well as between any pairs of objects of different coordinate systems. (e.g., for each pair of objects and their respective coordinate systems, distance is defined in terms of the Euclidean distance between the pairs of objects.)\n3. A model of one-dynamic data is assumed. (e.g., object tracking methods).\n4. The distance metric is allowed to vary between any pair of objects of different coordinate systems. (e.g., between pairs of objects of different spatial and temporal scales).\n5. A weighted least-squares approximation of the distance metric is used.\nWe propose a novel distance metric that, when applied to data of any dimensionality, is non-degradely related to Euclidean distance when there exists a non-zero ratio of the number of objects in the data to the number of points in the data. Furthermore, this ratio is defined based on the inverse of the inverse-distance operator.\nThis metric is not a complete or comprehensive theory of distance; in particular, it does not include the following properties:\n1. It does not allow a model to change its parameters to adjust for the different data dimensions.\n2. It does not allow for complex data with a non-trivial number of objects of different dimensions or of differing objects at each spatial and temporal scale.\nWe emphasize that the distance metric is a first approximation to a distance metric. More thorough treatment is to be provided in the work on the correlation distance metric by [J. Vondruis and A. P. G. S. de Bruijn, \"The correlation distance metric: An empirical measure of correlation.\", arxiv.org, 2005].\nFor the time being, however, it suffices for our discussion to recognize that the",
    "In a thrilling encounter, Ireland emerged victorious against South Africa with a tight 17-12 victory. The nail-biting match, held at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, saw Ireland cement their status as a force to reckon with in international rugby.\n\nThe fiery face-off, watched by an audience of millions worldwide, was a quintessential display of sporting prowess, strategy, grit and determination. Ireland, despite being the underdogs, stole the show with their superb execution of calculated moves, tenacious defence and accurate goal-kicking.\n\nJonathan Sexton, the Irish fly-half, put up a stellar performance and was instrumental in handing the Springboks their defeat. He notched up two penalties and a conversion, bolstering Ireland’s score to an unmatched 17. Yet, it was Andrew Conway's try in the closing minutes of the first half, which truly set the crowd alight.\n\nSouth Africa fought valiantly throughout. Their powerful forward pack and exceptional speed in the backs kept Ireland’s defence constantly under pressure. Handré Pollard kicked over four penalties, keeping the Springboks within touching distance. However, it was not enough to claim victory against an Irish side that displayed an almost impenetrable defence.\n\nApplauded for their polished teamwork, Ireland's performance was hailed as phenomenal. Their win came as a result of sheer perseverance, hard work, exhaustive training, and an exemplary demonstration of skill.\n\nThe Irish coach, Andy Farrell, expressed immense pride in his team’s effort post-match. \"This game was about character, and the boys showed it in heaps,\" he said. Opposing coach, Jacques Nienaber, while disappointed, gave due credit to the Irish side. “We were outplayed. Ireland deserved the victory today,\" he admitted.\n\nIreland's victory over South Africa provides a boost ahead of next week's clash with New Zealand, helping to raise confidence levels within the camp. The heartening win against a tough South African side is indeed a testament to their potential in the broader international rugby landscape.",

    "\"Stranger Than Fiction\" is an incredibly unique film that blends comedy, drama, and romance in a thought-provoking and compelling package. Will Ferrell gives a surprising, layered performance that breaks free from his usual slapstick comic roles, showing his ability to handle more serious material with both tenderness and nuance.\n\nThe premise of this film is enchantingly unconventional- a man who finds himself the unwitting protagonist of a novel being written by an author who is unaware that her fiction is someone's reality. The script is intelligent and original, with a perfect balance between surreal comedy and existential inquiry. \n\nThe supporting cast enriches the surreal narrative, especially Emma Thompson as the chain-smoking, neurotic author and Dustin Hoffman as the literature professor. Their performances are engaging, adding depth to the storyline. Even the \"minor\" characters have distinct attributes, which enhances the overall viewing experience.\n\nVisually, the film is also a treat. The cinematography expertly captures the mundane and fantastical elements of the story, often blurring the line between fiction and reality. Adding to this, the soundtrack resonates beautifully with the unfolding narrative, filled with engaging rhythms and songs that linger in your memory long after the credits have rolled.\n\nHowever, what truly sets \"Stranger Than Fiction\" apart is its exploration of life themes, such as fate, free will, and the intrinsic value of every individual's story. It asks viewers to think, to question, and to realize the impact our lives might be having on an unseen, grander scale.\n\nPossibly the best part of this film is its ability to take a step back from Hollywood's continued production of shallow and clichéd films. Instead, it offers a deep, well-crafted, and beautifully executed piece of cinema. Even if you're not a fan of Ferrell's comedic roles, I urge you to take a chance on this one - \"Stranger Than Fiction\" is a delightful film, full of charm, wit, and heart.",
    "The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has unequivocally denied recent rumours that the classic British sitcom, 'Blackadder', is set for a television comeback.\n\nSpeculation has been rife within the industry and among dedicated fans of the show since actor Sir Tony Robinson, who portrayed the character Baldrick in the historical comedy, suggested a new series could be on the horizon during an interview last week. However, the BBC insists there are no plans to revive the iconic series.\n\nIn a brief statement, a BBC spokesperson said, \"Whilst we love the unforgettable sitcom, Blackadder, as much as our audiences do, we have no current plans to bring the show back for a fifth series.\"\n\nBlackadder was a staple of British television and gained a considerable global following from the early '80s to the late '90s. The series centred on the ill-fated antics of the scheming Edmund Blackadder, played by Rowan Atkinson, across various historical periods. It also saw performances from a host of celebrated British actors, including Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Miranda Richardson and Rik Mayall.\n\nThe show was widely popular for its clever puns and sarcastic humour intelligently woven into historical contexts. The last series, 'Blackadder Goes Forth', which depicted the trench warfare of the First World War, concluded poignantly on a sombre note, with its main characters going \"over the top\" into No Man's Land.\n\nThe refusal to confirm a reboot comes amidst a trend of popular shows such as 'Friends', 'Frasier' and 'The Office' either returning or being rebooted for nostalgic fans.\n\nReacting to this refusal, some fans expressed their disappointment on social media, with many stating that they had been looking forward to the potential return of the cunning Blackadder and his hilariously dim-witted sidekick, Baldrick. Others, however, agreed with the BBC's decision, fearing that a revival could tarnish the original show's perfect ending.\n\nFor now, it seems fans of the quick-witted Edmund Blackadder will need to satisfy their cravings with reruns of the original four series and occasional Christmas specials, available on streaming services.",
    "An industry breakthrough sees the incredible landmark of five million copies sold by the popular game, Halo 2, Microsoft confirmed today. The acclaimed sci-fi shooter game has once again broken records, soaring its way to unimaginable heights and further cementing its place within the pantheon of most successful games of all time.\n\nHalo 2, developed by the American company Bungie, was initially released in November 2004.

    "The following is an abstract for a paper on quasi-likelihood for global point processes.\n\nSpatial-Spatial Point Processes\n\nThe traditional approach to solving nonlinear nonabelian system of linear equations has been the Gaussian mixture models that have been used for centuries. These have been successfully used to solve both nonlinear nonabelian systems and linear systems of nonabelian systems. For nonstrict nonlinear equations, the traditional approach has been to search a solution that has a Gaussian distribution in the form of a Markov chain that is an extension of the Gaussian model of density estimation. For linear systems of nonabelian systems, the conventional approach is to search a solution that produces a smooth probability distribution over the parameters under a non-strict linearization. This non-trivial statistical model is essentially based on linear discriminant analysis. It is known that the proposed non-strict nonabelian model is not a good fit to the nonlinear systems discussed above. Here we introduce quasi-likelihood function, which is based on an approximation of the Gaussian model that can easily recover the Gaussian distribution. We find that this approximation can give reasonable results on a large number of problems. We conclude by studying a small category of linear systems of nonabelian systems.",
    "A New Validity Index for Fuzzy-Possibilistic C-Means Clustering\n\nThe Fuzzy-Possibilistic (FP) is a powerful clustering algorithm and its use for unsupervised feature selection has gained prominence in the past few years. While FP is great for classification tasks, it remains limited in comparison to more sophisticated and accurate supervised classifiers. This research presents a novel method of using the fuzzy factorization technique to produce a new factorization that is much more precise and robust while at the same time achieving robustness against large-scale multiclass classification problems. The paper presents several interesting statistical properties of this new factorization, including its ability to discriminate between two discrete categories, its ability to discriminate between a non-linear classifier and another classifier whose linear features have not yet been explored, and an easy-to-apply practical application to a wide range of practical tasks.\n\nAbstract:\n\nGraphic Classification is a highly prevalent task in computer science. Fuzzy-Possibilistic Clustering (FPCC) exploits fuzzy features to approximate the nonlinear classifier as a combination of a nonlinear classifier and a linear classifier. It is a valuable tool for feature selection since it can be used in conjunction with traditional classification methods. It should be noted, however, that FPCC is just \"a toy\" factorization algorithm in its core. It is very weakly reliable and it is well known. Some authors state that FPCC is much harder to train than a conventional nonlinear classifier. This paper presents a novel factorization method for FPCC that can be scaled up to huge dimensions (up to 1024). We prove the robustness of our result, show that it can be applied to problems that are far beyond fuzzy-factored (e.g., classification), and we present a practical application that allows FPCC to be applied to a huge variety of categories.",
    "\"The movie \"The Cannonball Run\" was a popular movie because the characters acted like they didn't know each other's names; they just went to the same place and acted the same in certain places, where the dialogue and scenes fit the story, but they made it seem like they weren't working together at all. The movie \"Cannonball Run\" also did a good job of creating multiple timelines, each of them connected by the same action, with certain events occurring in several time periods. Many people liked this because it was like having multiple alternate Universes in one movie. In both versions of the movie we had to make up our minds whether the movie characters actually knew each other, or if the movie was a complete fraud based on \"alternate Universes\". For me, the movie \"Cannonball Run\" was just a bunch of people that happened to be in the same place running across the same obstacles. Also, the actors did their best to appear like they didn't know each other, and it worked well – for the most part. I don't believe the movie to be a \"classic\", I don't think it's even a good movie. If you happen to like this movie, then you aren't paying attention. If you do like this movie, please don't feel obligated to like it even if you don't like it. If it doesn't make you want to watch other movies, or you really like this character, I would guess that you will enjoy it. The characters are decent, the action is a little boring, but when the movie was over I felt satisfied. This movie's \"R-rating\" in particular didn't bother me, so I don't know how anyone could get upset when they see the movie. It really didn't try to shock me in the least, and I think it had the right amount of violence. Just like \"Spice World\", I was able to ignore the movie's graphic violence because I was watching an action movie. The movie \"The Cannonball Run\" is not worth a full star.\n\nHere is the full text excerpt from that book review by Steve Johnson that was included in the review we posted on July 9th:\n\n\"Cannonball Run\" was an enjoyable movie to watch, even if I don't think it was quite as good as many people expected it to be.

    "I thought massages could help my back pain, but i had a bad one and even though my back got a bit better i was still very shaky. It felt like my neck would crumble at anytime. After doing a few people suggested I go to a massager and just give it to my body. So i ordered this body massager and got it today. This massage gun is called the X2 and it has 5 different levels. And it works pretty fast at the first 2 but gets slower as it goes down. And it won't give you any more stimulation than what is given. However, the description says to keep it at a slow setting and try not to push it too hard. But I can barely push it at all. The most difficult level you will ever try is level 3. It makes me feel like my back is going to explode. I think its because the speed is just too fast. You will not be completely calm. I am not sure if I will ever feel so calm ever again. I have my fiancee stay over tonight so I can try to find something that works. (I did not need my gun at the hotel but I am curious how it will feel when it is out of my house)\n\n\nSo a lot of people are not getting their advertised results.\n\n\nI believe the problem stems from a very long battery life, a lack of features or too-high expectations\n\n\nI like getting my relief from massage rather than electric massage to the part of my anatomy of interest and I think the X2 is a great tool.\n\n\nThe problem is that too much is being expected of this product and its not doing that in my experience.\n\n\nThe massage intensity is just not fast enough. I try to do it as gently as possible, i.e., as little force as possible, but the X2 still gives me too strong a sensation to be comfortable, which is good because how I would like to get relief from it. There are other massage devices that are more powerful. I also have a different type of massage gun on hand, but I have not used it. The price of this product is a bit steep too.\n\n\nThe vibrations are nice because at low power you get nice deep pressure but I found that I could not feel the vibration even after using it for a long time.

    "It is hard to imagine that I am the first poster here to attempt this, although I'm sure someone more savvy than me discovered it.\n\nUsing a script, I was able to determine the ip address of anyone who was using one of the websites that allow you to easily add or remove account, and what sites they were using and what ip they were utilizing, based only a name and the time of day each visit was made. I made this script, because every person I've attempted to take info from has been caught without the information being known to the site owner. I've tested it on both Google's cache, and the actual page contents of all four of the websites I was attempting to take info from (Google, Yahoo, Twitter, and Pinterest). (I'll post an explanation later on this how it was possible to make the tests work correctly because the sites seem to have different timestamps, or to be using slightly different servers than the other sites.) Basically, to give the sites to those websites to test against, I could only set the time and then see if that IP was connected to the requested page at some point during the time. Obviously if you are attempting to find someone's IP address, it is preferable to get them to use a VPN where the source IP can be found. All that is needed to stop this are some simple DNS records, which anyone could get easily from the major broadband providers.\n\nThe important thing to note is how easy it was to stop people's ip addresses, even with the help of Google and Google's cache. So it would be possible to prevent anyone from accessing a certain website, even if they were not using a proxy using any of the sites that would have given me their IP.\n\nI'm certain there is a way to implement this, but to do to so requires a major update to our DNS system… If someone is reading this and is interested in doing this, PM me and I might be able to help you along.\n\nUpdate (November 2011):\n\nI'm also working with a member on this topic. I'll post a message here shortly.",

And an adversarial network architecture is designed to ensure that the images have strong diversity and can be used for training the medical image segmentation network. Therefore, it is feasible for networks to extract feature information from superpixels, which can improve the performance of the network. In addition, it does not need to modify and retrain the network, and can directly apply to other segmentation networks.\n\n```\n\n\n### Training and Evaluations\n\nWe conducted three groups of experiments based on models without, with, and without SPDA.\nFirst, we trained an UNet++ model from scratch on the liver tumor segmentation task.

    "The Commitments is basically a comedy, but the situations portrayed are very realistic. They show how a group of friends living under the same set of circumstances can react very differently to the same situation. The main events in this movie involve the formation of a \"fake\" band and the band's eventual success. I say \"fake\" because they were pretending they were proficient musicians who could play the musical instruments that they only learned how to play shortly before they started playing. At first many of them thought that if they just played hard enough and long enough, that they would gradually improve, but that is not the case. In order to actually improve, they have to practice regularly and with someone who would give them direction and correct flaws in the music. Because of this, some of them quit, or were asked to quit. But I also think that the ones that stayed helped each other become skilled enough to perform in front of a live audience.\nThe group chose the film that gave the group its name, as a means of publicity. They decided to \"fake\" a television appearance based on the premise that they were performing music by The Clash. It was just their way of letting the public know who they were. When they finally actually performed on the local music show, they did not tell the director what they would be playing, so when they walked out on stage, they went straight into a piece of music that sounded like it was written by, or inspired by The Clash. This piece of music was not very good considering that the members of the group really did not know how to read music or play any instruments yet. Some of them couldn't even carry a tune, but the performance was not a very good way of attracting an audience. But if they had not performed then, it would have been difficult to establish credibility after they really started playing later on in the film.\nI was really impressed how the cast played their roles, because they did a convincing job convincing the audience that they really were people that had just decided to form a band. However, I was also impressed by how well they were able to convince us that their musicianship was not very good when they performed in the beginning of the film. It was a true \"fish out of water\" type of situation. But as the story goes from there, we follow their development from a band of wannabe's to real professionals, and they",

    "I've been pondering this topic for quite some time and decided to share my thoughts. Apologies in advance if anyone is taken aback by my take, it is simply one perspective and by no means discounts the beauty and importance some people associate with weddings.\n\nIt may sound stinging, but looking at the behavior pattern of many wedding attendees, it often seems as if they display more enthusiasm at the prospect of free meals, dance, photo sessions, and chances to flaunt their fashion tastes, rather than the actual ceremony uniting two souls.\n\nThe conspicuous consumption on display, particularly in this era of social media, often eclipses the genuine sentiments attached to the marriage ceremony. On numerous such occasions, I’ve observed how guests are more inclined towards selfies, groupfies, live videos, and stories for their Instagram or Snapchat, rather than paying complete attention to the ceremony or connecting on a personal level with other attendees.\n\nAnother aspect is food and drink. It often seems as though a significant number of attendees are more eager for the feast than the vows, sometimes even going to the extent of complaining if the food isn't up to their winding list of expectations.\n\nNow, please don’t get me wrong. I’m not against enjoying the atmosphere and camaraderie at a joyous event like a wedding, and it’s not like I haven’t taken my fair share of food photos too! However, it's nonetheless weird to witness such a sacred occasion transforming into an exclusive food and drink fest, with the ceremony itself becoming secondary.\n\nI believe weddings should be about celebrating love and commitment, rather than turning into an Instagram photoshoot or culinary critique. Let's remember the true essence of weddings and try to show more interest in the couple’s emotions and their new journey, rather than picking apart the menu and decor.\n\nAgain, this doesn't apply to everyone, and of course, not all weddings are the same, but let's discuss this. Has anyone else observed this trend or is it just me? Would love to hear other perspectives and personal experiences.",
    "Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has expressed his confidence in the club's younger players, stating that the team's future success hinges on their development and ability to respond to pressure.\n\nA stalwart of the game and the man who led Manchester United to numerous victories during his 26-year tenure, Ferguson is recognised globally for his ability to nurture young talent. He is known for his role in developing the famous \"Class of '92\" – the group of young players that included David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville, who went on to become superstars under his guidance.\n\nIn an interview, Ferguson emphasised the importance of young talent in the club. He said, \"They are the future. The club has always put its faith in young players and it's up to them to seize the opportunity\".\n\n\"In my opinion, their dedication, ambition and ability to handle pressure will play a significant role in the club's success or failure over the coming seasons,\" he added.\n\nFerguson, 79, who retired as manager in 2013 but remains a director at Old Trafford, furthermore expressed particular excitement about Mason Greenwood, Brandon Williams, and Scott McTominay. He praised them for their potential, describing them as possessing that \"Manchester United DNA\".\n\n\"Mason, Brandon, Scott – they've shown fantastic potential and what we call that United DNA. They've been here from a young age, learnt the values, and these lads have got a great opportunity ahead,\" he said.\n\nHe also pointed out their remarkable progression, playing regularly in first team fixtures, and with Mason Greenwood in particular grabbing headlines for his scoring abilities. \n\nHowever, Ferguson warned against unrealistic expectations, saying, \"You can't expect them to perform miracles overnight. They need time, the right guidance, and a supportive environment. But I have faith they will deliver.\"\n\nFerguson's comments were welcomed by the club, with a spokesperson stating, \"Sir Alex is a legend at the club and his continued support and faith in our younger players means a great deal. His experience and wisdom are invaluable resources for our players.\"\n\nThe faith in youth has been a linchpin in the philosophy of Manchester United since the days of Sir Matt Busby. These remarks from a true club legend like Ferguson highlight that the tradition continues and further underscores the importance of youth development at the club.\n",
    "This is a story that I still remember vividly because of how much it impacted me. A few years back, I lived in an apartment complex in the heart of the city. I had this neighbor, an elderly woman who lived alone. We exchanged pleasantries and had regular small talks, nothing beyond that. \n\nOne icy winter morning, as I was leaving to work, I found her waiting outside my door. She looked extremely worried. She told me she slipped and fell on the icy stairs while going to pick up the morning newspaper. She wasn't severely hurt but the fall had shaken her up pretty bad.\n\nThat incident made me realize how difficult winter could be for someone her age living by themselves. So, for the rest of that icy season, I woke up a little earlier, picked up her newspaper, got some fresh bread from a nearby bakery, and left it by her door. By the time she woke up, she always had a newspaper and fresh bread waiting for her.\n\nThe smile on her face made me feel like a hero. It was a small gesture, but I knew it meant a lot to her. She reminded me of my own grandmother in some ways and I was glad I could help make her winters less challenging.\n\nMonths later, I had to move out of the city for work and lost contact with her. Recently, I found out through a friend who still lived in the same complex, that she had passed away a few months ago. Although it saddened me, she left a powerful impact on me and a memory that I deeply cherish to this day.\n\nThis story is a gentle reminder that our small actions can have profound effects on others, and you don't need to move mountains to make a difference in someone's life.

Not only does Dr. Doom have the same project in mind for himself, he also has plans for many more robots of all types; he just needs to know who possesses the technology to make them real.\n\n\"After an intense chase that ends up in the ruins of S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, Tony Stark and Dr. Doom finally do battle, though the robot they bring with them dies spectacularly.\n\n\"To prevent himself from falling into Doom's hands, Stark decides to leave his suit behind with the help of a very strange and very beautiful woman – Sharon Carter.\n\n\"As soon as they arrive on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new headquarters, they discover that not only is Sharon a traitor, but the very base she is living in is actually one of the robotic bases that have infiltrated the earth. She leaves S.H.I.E.L.D. to go back to her home planet - which is then destroyed.\n\n\"This leads into the second act of the movie (a plot point that is a little contrived; we saw the same thing in the comics and it was just a plot device for the last two act of the movie, when the entire film was a \"retake\" of the last two scenes of the original-story), in which the two heroes finally encounter Doom, which was indeed, in the end, their downfall…\n\n\"A long, long scene of Doom ranting about humanity's destruction is broken by a large robotic voice",
    "I started as a kid to the tune of 4 years old. I lived at home with my mom and dad, had a pretty normal household until I hit puberty. I got on the computer at around the age of 10 or 11 when it was cool to get on the internet. I was on the internet every single day until I was about 14. That is when my friend group on Facebook changed forever. It started with a few close friends, and we would use it as a way to get to know one another. After high school, I had found my place on an online messaging platform called Kik. I started doing better online but still couldn't talk to people face to face. I started going to school early. I'd walk to school in the mornings, and by the time you got to high school, you were practically walking everywhere.\n\nEventually, I met an online girl who I would go and hang out with for lunch or a movie or, uh, just the same old day. Then… she gave me her info. I had no idea this is what it was like. She gave me her name and address and I went and lived in her house. We started talking and it quickly became obvious that she was not going to go out with me for a while. I told myself I could handle the rejection. I had her phone number and her current phone number. (which by this point I was using). My life went on and she called her boyfriend and started telling him about me. After a month or so, I asked if he knew anything. Then he told her. She stopped responding. I decided to just go on with life and never talked anymore. The relationship went on for another month and I moved on.\n\nWe met again two years later and we continued to hang out the best we could. I met my girlfriend and we've been together ever since.\n\nMy friends all stopped talking to me after that. Not because they didn't like me, but because I didn't have anyone to be friends with anymore. The only person I met who was friendly was the guy at the coffee shop. I never talked to him in class because he's not really my type and didn't seem like he'd stick around after the 10th or 11th time we met. It's gotten to the point now",
    "Reviewed by mcmahon on January 12, 2008\nWhen I had walked out of \"Cloverfield,\" I had an uneasy feeling that it was one of the best movies I had seen in a very long time. An entire year has gone by since I had seen the film, and I still think it's one of the best movies of last year. It definitely lives up to the hype surrounding it. I had never heard of the movie before, but a few weeks before the release, it was all over television and the Internet.\nI walked into the theater wanting to see what was all the hullaballoo about, and I walked out blown away. The hype surrounding this movie definitely didn't live up to this picture. What I found is a movie that is so much different than what it was advertised. \"Cloverfield\" turned out to be a terrific, action-packed roller coaster ride of a movie unlike any other movie I've ever seen.\n\"Cloverfield\" chronicles the story of a series of people as they attempt to survive an attack by alien, Godzilla-sized creatures that lay waste to the world. The movie started with a man who is having a party with his friends and girlfriend. He decides to head out on an adventure to get video of giant monster. However, things get deadly when the creature attacks. He makes a 911 call before being cut short.\nThen, the movie cuts to the perspective of Beth, who lives in New York City. A series of smaller monsters begin to attack the city. It's during this attack that Hud, one of Beth's friends, is killed. The remaining characters, which include Rob, the boyfriend of Beth, struggle to find safety. Throughout the movie, their perspective of the events is shown.\nIt's an interesting story that I won't give away, as it is essential not to give away any spoilers.\nThe best part of the film was the action. I had never seen scenes like that before, and they were fantastic. The movie was so intense that I was sitting in my seat gripping the arms of my chair the entire time. This is a definite credit to the director, Matt Reeves. This movie is so different, in the best way possible, from most of the movies being made today. This is definitely the best, most intense science-fiction movie I've ever seen",

Some people are saying online donation sites give more money to those who give more money than others.\n\nThe CDC says online programs like GoFundMe, CrowdRise and Charity Navigator should be considered charities, not charities fundraising sites.\n\nThe CDC is asking affected donors about the problem Monday in a conference call.\n\nGoFundMe says it is working on an update of its web site for charities, but it isn't clear when and how the update will be available.\n\nOnline services for soliciting donations were created four years ago and are widely used. GoFundMe says some people are claiming that \"profits\" are being given undue advantages on its sites. It says no one is paying charities fees or fees to participate, and says if people feel something is wrong, they should contact their service providers.\n\nOne issue is that only the donor can view the money donated until it's shipped to charity, since the money is being kept in a bank deposit account. A donor can, however, go to the donation page to view the money in transit, the agency said.\n\nSome donors said they were getting a different amount of money because of their gift's type.

    "- Singapore posted double-digit growth figures and said the trend would continue this year.\n- The government said it expected the city-state's economy to expand at a robust pace of 8%, taking it far above the global annual growth rate of below 4%.\n- Singapore, which has no natural resources - apart from its citizens - has one of the healthiest economies in South East Asia.\n- The government is expected to run a budget surplus of around S$4bn (£1bn £1bn) this year, but has warned it would curb public spending if oil prices soars to above $40 a barrel.\n- But in the first quarter of 2005, the economy grew at an annualised 6% in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). Exports are up 10% from the same period last year.\n\"We are heading for a good year and a good year with robust growth,\" said Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as economists forecast Singapore, like its main regional rival Malaysia, to emerge from a soft patch as the global economy perks up. -BBC\nIn the last five years, Singapore's growth has been on the rise despite some ups and downs in global economic conditions. However, one factor that has been affecting the economy is the rising level of unemployment among the resident workforce. In recent years, the rise in unemployment have resulted in many Singaporeans and PRs (Permanent Residents) relocating overseas for better opportunities.\nSingapore's GDP on a per capita basis\nSingapore's GDP per capita as at end 2004 is US$42,600. In other words, for every Singaporean's there is US$42.6K of GDP.\nIn recent decades, while the population of Singapore has been growing steadily, the GDP on a per capita basis has been growing at a much faster pace. In fact, it has increased more than 5 times over the last 25 years! And that's quite an amazing accomplishment.\n\"We make the world richer\"\nThat's a powerful statement. And it appears that Singapore has been on the right track to make it come true. Over the years, the government's vision to make Singapore a global trading hub as well as a vibrant financial and logistics centre has been successful. The result is that many MNCs have located their regional HQs here to be close to the",
    "US economy still growing - US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke has said the US economy remained on a solid, broad and durable economic trajectory. \"The US economy continues to extend its solid growth trajectory, with most of it driven by durable consumer demand growth,\" Mr Bernanke said yesterday. *** Mr Bernanke said the unemployment rate continued to fall gradually, dropping from 6.2 per cent at the start of the year to 5.6 per cent. *** Economists had been expecting the unemployment rate to fall to 5.6 per cent. *** The US Federal Reserve chair said he expected US growth to accelerate over the coming six months, aided by a rebound in exports. \"We see downside risks to that outlook, but it would not be appropriate yet on that basis to revise up our forecast for US growth beyond the initial six-month pace,\" he said. *** The chairman said the Fed's main interest rate is not expected to move again until late 2014. \"The current trajectory is very, very solid and it should be fairly rapid,\" he said. He also reiterated an easing of monetary policy in the United States - but he said the move was not expected to affect the economy in the coming months.\n\nFor the sake of full disclosure, here is a link to the article mentioned above...\n\nBut the truth is I can't find any reference to this article at all in the MSM.\n\nUPDATE: On Friday afternoon I was sent the following link from the WSJ: \"...the unemployment rate of 5.9% is down from 6.3 percent in March, but it's still about 4.7% below its 2008 peak.\"\n\nThis would put the March rate almost exactly at the low mark of the 2008 recession…\n\nAnd that last point above is a very important one.\n\nFor if the level of unemployment were to actually rise and go back down to the level that existed when the recession officially hit in December of 2008, at least a small portion of our wealth would have to be destroyed in order for the economy to be brought back to prior levels where virtually everybody was in the system.\n\nBut not only do the elite keep pushing the unemployment rate up and up, but they are now pushing it even higher in order to create the illusion that we still have a booming job market that is more than 3 million jobs below the levels where we had previously been heading previously…",
    "\"Enchanted\" (2012)\n\nI see now how this could end up being the greatest Disney story of all time. I guess every so often you do the \"Let's Make a Movie\" and get something a bit out of the ordinary, but nothing that has ever had me crying as we pulled the film out of the vault. \"Enchanted\" is simply that. A love story. If it seems boring to you, it's mostly because you haven't seen a love story.\n\nThere are so many things that make this film special. For one thing, the story isn't really that much about the story. Every scene is focused on a particular character that we are supposed to think is adorable, silly, or even creepy. For instance, I found it amazing how the director decided to show Prince Phillip (Paul Giamatti) walking down a corridor and the room behind him to make the audience think he was being chased by some evil witch (Cher).\n\nI found it so cool how they used this as a plot point, but it is also not that important. At the end of the day, it's still very much about the friendship between young women who happen to be cursed. It feels so rare and special today that something has to be so obviously romantic, it would be a miracle if someone didn't try to make it somehow erotic, with the whole thing being centered on two women that are just friends walking down the hallway together.\n\nThe story is also unique for a lot of reasons:\n\nThe princess is not human, she's a demon;\n\nPrince Phillip has to save her;\n\nThere are no actual monsters attacking them, it's just witches;\n\nThe princess is a real demon, that doesn't want to lose her virginity;\n\nThere is a magical forest behind her house (so I guess it's not a fairy tale, although in the trailers it was being described as like Alice in Wonderland-kind of like Cinderella without the love story);\n\nShe is just a girl with magical powers (though in reality her powers are supernatural as well);\n\nIt is an animated movie, with two live action characters: the girl and the boy;\n\nIt is the last movie from the \"Disney Renaissance\" (this is before the Disney Renaissance). This is a time period where their movies made $10-20 Billion worldwide in box",
    "This paper presents a novel approach for medical imaging data segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We propose an end-to-end trainable, deep learning model designed to overcome the challenges associated with conventional radiological imaging techniques, such as MRI and CT scans. Using a diverse dataset, we demonstrate our CNN's ability to detect and segment a variety of anatomical structures with high precision, surpassing traditional methods in both speed and accuracy. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the model's inner workings to aid in interpretation and reproducibility. The paper concludes with a discussion on the potentials and limitations of using CNN-based systems in the realm of medical image processing and suggests pathways for future research.

    "\"American Sniper\" is a riveting exploration of a soldier's psyche amidst the turmoil of war. Clint Eastwood's outstanding directorial abilities amalgamate the decision-making intricacies and emotional turbulence experienced by individuals on the frontline effectively. \n\nBradley Cooper has rendered a stupendous performance as Chris Kyle, the deadliest sniper in U.S military history. His transformational journey from a Texas cowboy to a hardened war hero is poignant and pulls at the heartstrings of the audience adroitly. Sienna Miller, too, impresses with her performance as Kyle's wife. Their relationship delicately illustrates the toll war exerts on the families of those serving.\n\nThe film adequately manages to present the unbiased complexity of war. It does not glorify or demonize either side, but rather, emphasizes the effects of battle on both the mind and body. The gripping action sequences perfectly balance the quieter, more introspective moments of the plot, providing a cinematic experience that's thrilling, moving, and tragic in equal measure.\n\nThe production value of \"American Sniper\" is top-notch; it features exceptional cinematography and sound design that only heightens the intensity of the narrative. Each gunshot echoes the price of humanity during wartime and every frame reiterates the dichotomy of war.\n\n\"American Sniper\" is a gritty, gripping war drama that draws you into the life of a man who was much more than a marksman; he was a husband, a father, and a friend. This film successfully humanizes the faceless soldiers we often hear about, an accomplishment worth applauding. The film's ability to showcase the harsh realities of war and how debilitatively it haunts those who have experienced it, is undoubtedly its biggest achievement.\n\nWhile \"American Sniper\" has sparked debates about its political implications, it should be viewed primarily as a character study and an exploration of the human toll of war. It is visceral, powerful, and at times, overwhelming - in short, a brilliantly directed war movie.",
    "In this study, we propose a novel method for medical image segmentation that minimises observer variation by combining deep learning and surrogate-assisted genetic algorithms. The conventional image segmentation methods often suffer from observer-dependent variations, which can significantly affect the diagnosis and treatment planning. We address this issue by introducing a new observer-variation aware segmentation method that consists of a deep learning model for feature extraction and a surrogate-assisted genetic algorithm for optimal selection of segmentation parameters. The proposed method was evaluated on various medical images and demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, and consistency as compared to conventional methods. Additionally, surrogate-assisted genetic algorithms significantly reduced the computational cost, making our method practical for real-world medical applications. Future work will focus on further improving the method's adaptability to different types of medical imaging scenarios and diagnostic criteria.",
    "_I've been a big fan of both of the previous two_ Pirates of the Caribbean _films, loving the performances (especially by Johnny Depp in his eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow), the great special and visual effects, and the overall fun of the movies. After the first movie was a smash hit, and the second one was almost as profitable (though not as good, in my opinion), expectations were pretty high for the third film._ Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest _has now come and gone, and I'm sorry to say that it isn't nearly as good as the first two films. The plot is almost a parody of the first film, re-using practically the same set-up, with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters as the protagonists, and both characters having to go on quests that could possibly aid all of \"the nine pirate lords\" when a voodoo curse is uttered against them at the end of the previous film. While the acting (Depp in particular) are as spot-on as ever, and there are some enjoyable scenes and special effects (the opening shot of this one especially), there's an overall sense of re-hashing the same formula from the first two movies (and the fourth movie is also going to use that formula). What makes it so disappointing is how good the first two movies were. I recommend this movie to fans of the series, but not to newcomers who either haven't seen the previous films or don't even know how good they were. As for me, I'm hoping that the fourth film, which I understand is now being directed by Gore Verbinski instead of Gore Verbinski, will be a fun adventure film._\n\nIf you're curious about the history of _Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,_ or just want to know what goes on behind the scenes, you can read the following trivia for the movie:\n\n**•** There is a reason why Captain Jack Sparrow and Will Turner were in the brig. At the end of _Curse of the Black Pearl,_ after they free Jack's crew from the brig, Will asks the man who's been captured with the two, \"What's your name?\" The prisoner replies, \"Kenzie.\" This man, played by Stuart Wilson, was the second",
    "We have a little public space behind our local liquor store that always looked to me like it could use some landscaping… maybe a bit of a fence, some new grass, some flowers, some benches, and perhaps something that would improve the appearance of the building next door – a restaurant. To that end, I've been keeping my eyes peeled for any items that would help improve the appearance of the empty space.\nThat brings us to the kite.\nWe had a couple of kites leftover from a party, and I thought that a kite in the sky might be a good way to add a bit of visual appeal to the space. As I was putting it together, I decided that a colorful kite would be the most attention-getting item in the sky.\nI bought a piece of fence that would fit well in the space, and cut it down to make a small fence. I used it as a prop to frame the kite and to help make the kite prominent in the background of the photo.\nOnce the picture had been made, I put the fencing into a new frame, had it mounted, and took it to the space.\nWhen I arrived at the space, it looked a bit dismal still, but the bright colors of the fence and kite really made a difference. I've also included an image of the unfinished space.\nI couldn't be more pleased with how the fencing looks with the other pieces on the site.\nThe fence is a bit large for the space, and I think I'll cut it down to reduce its size.

After seeing people stop and chat about it, I made sure I left notes with the restaurant asking the owner to please come see it and let me know what he thinks.\nI'm very happy with the results… just a very simple kite in the sky… not doing anything more than drawing some attention to the space.\nSo what do you think? Good idea? Bad idea?\nHere's what I do when I see something like this… I ignore it. Maybe someday, if I see a kite fluttering",
    "The BBC has learnt that Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, told colleagues that Mr Blunkett's comments were \"totally wrong\" and should be rescinded. And the Prime Minister's spokesman said: \"Everyone accepts that his views were completely wrong.\" Mr Blunkett had said there was a \"real fear\" of young British Muslims being sucked into terrorism.\nHe told BBC1's Newsnight programme that British Muslims were under more pressure than their counterparts abroad. In what was widely seen as an attempt at damage limitation, he subsequently tried to withdraw some of his remarks. \"My words were wrong - my intention was not to suggest prejudice towards British Muslims, only that there was a fear that they might be sucked into terrorism.\nBut my words were wrong,\" he said in a statement. It had all started at a conference at the weekend when the former Cabinet minister said that Britain had a particular problem with terrorist groups in the West Midlands drawing on a pool of young British Muslims. Mr Blunkett did not name any specific group when he made his remarks.\nBut he implied there was a threat posed by some radicalised Muslim clerics who \"have chosen to preach hate of everything that Britain is and has fought for\". \"We are facing a particular problem in the West Midlands, where I am concerned that we are in danger of producing a generation of young British Muslims who see no virtue in anything British.\"\nHe argued that the only option was for the government to \"argue the merits of a tolerant and inclusive modern Britain vigorously\". However the Islamic Human Rights Commission, which is backed by the Muslim Council of Britain, accused the former education secretary's comments of fanning hate and fear. His remarks were also condemned by Tory leader David Cameron.\nMr Blunkett added in his statement: \"I fear young British Muslims do feel they have been marginalized or even abandoned by the mainstream of British life. \"They are frustrated at the injustices they see around them which they believe are never addressed and it is that frustration that some extremists seek to exploit.\"\nThe statement issued on his behalf added: \"The secretary of state made his remarks regarding the West Midlands in the context of a discussion of a real problem faced in the region and his statement was not intended to cause offence to Muslim Britain but to tackle a deeply-felt grievance.\"\nPosted",
    "The film \"Battleship Potemkin\" is a profound piece of cinema that leaves a lasting imprint on its viewers. Dated 1925, it might be considered old by some, but its themes and cinematic techniques remain timeless, far from being irrelevant or antiquated. \n\nDirected by Eisenstein, this gem from the silent film era is a masterclass in effective storytelling. It provocatively depicts the Russian naval mutiny and the potentially explosive situation of 1905, creating a sense of unrest that remains palpable throughout. Film techniques that we now take for granted – cross-cutting, use of montage, and rhythmic editing – are wielded like an artist's brush in this film.\n\nWhat stands out is its storytelling approach - where explicit narrative is largely absent, but everything is told via the visuals. It revolutionizes the concept of visual storytelling, presenting complex sequences of events through images alone, foreshadowing the future of cinema where the power of a scene is measured not only by its contextual content but also by its visual force and impact.\n\nThe Odessa Steps sequence continues to be one of the most iconic set pieces in film history. Its pacing, building tension, and unsettling violence are still a subject of film studies. It narrates an intense repression that simultaneously evokes anger, horror, and exhilarating energy, pushing the boundaries of cinema as a method of raw storytelling.\n\nEach frame in \"Battleship Potemkin\" has a powerful sense of composition, balanced by the devastating narrative it depicts. The moving score further enhances the film's emotive tone, leading viewers through various stages of the uprising, effectively generating empathy and shock.\n\nOne might argue the political propaganda element of the film; however, its artistic merit transcends it. \"Battleship Potemkin\" is less about advocating a certain political agenda and more about the human struggle for dignity and justice.\n\n\"Battleship Potemkin,\" despite being nearly a century old, remains a must-see for any film enthusiast. It's not just a movie, it's an experience – one that exposes you to the raw potential of film as a medium for intense and compelling storytelling. The film's influence on many filmmakers and cinematic techniques cement its place as a timeless piece of art.",
    "SwipeCut: Interactive Segmentation with Diversified Seed Proposals\nXiyang Wang, Vignesh Ramanathan, Xiaogang Wang, Anima Anandkumar, Alan L. Yuille (2022-02-24)\n\nAbstract:\nVideo object segmentation (VOS) aims at finding the boundary of moving objects of interest in videos. Although significant progress has been made on VOS via learning-based approaches, they only use a single proposal for object segmentation. This poses a challenge in segmenting objects with small or thin structures, such as wires and tubes in medical videos. To handle these challenges, we propose a novel approach for learning from interactive annotations. Specifically, we use a differentiable random-walk algorithm to generate multiple seed proposals for interactive segmentation. Additionally, we propose a novel interactive loss function, which takes into account both the user preference over multiple proposals as well as the preference of the user as the annotation progresses. Besides, we propose a model that has three main components: spatial features from an RGB backbone for capturing object appearance, temporal features for learning the trajectory of objects, and object-level features for encoding the appearance as well as the trajectory of each segment. A set of experiments on three different VOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods.

This comes less than a year after the firm emerged from the significant financial scandal that resulted in its bankruptcy in 2002.\n\nThe news resulted in a 24% rise in the MCI's stock to $21.78 in New York trading on Monday, its highest price since June 2002, valuing the company at around $5.6 billion.

    "The Dutch have begun preparations for national celebrations on 20 July, the day Vincent van Gogh is believed to have shot himself. Van Gogh's last film was premiered in the Hague on 19 July. It was part of a series shot by a French documentary team on four continents in the first year after World War II. The film shows one of the first days of peace in Holland, recorded by director Joris Ivens. There are interviews with Dutch war veterans, street scenes with women and children cheering and dancing, and the celebrations in Dam Square with a triumphant concert by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Ivens filmed these images a few months after Allied forces liberated the country in May 1945. The Dutch were delighted with their freedom from Nazi occupation. In those dark time, Holland and the rest of Europe was in the desperate phase of the war. In the Netherlands, the most terrible times were the Hunger Winter of 1944-45. The country was starving, its citizens weak and ill. A terrible famine raged throughout the country. People were in bad shape and the war was still not over. But the end was near. After liberation, people felt the need to celebrate. And this is why they danced in the streets of their cities and towns as the Dutch government and the rest of the country slowly began to recover. In Dam Square, a large crowd celebrated with a concert by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. The music of Richard Wagner and Ludwig van Beethoven and Richard Strauss was heard. (Ivens's film was originally in black and white; the current version was colorized by a Dutch expert earlier this year.) The film ends in the rain, with the crowd leaving, carrying with them the memories of a day of great joy, and with the sound of a little girl singing \"God is God, and we are all his children\" in Dutch, the national anthem of the Netherlands. The short black-and-white film by Joris Ivens was originally shot in 1945. It premiered on 19 July on Nederland-1, the public broadcasting service for the Netherlands. Joris Ivens is famous for his movies about the Spanish Civil War and the liberation of Poland during World War II. The van Gogh movie he shot in 1945 was intended as a celebration of the Dutch nation. Joris Ivens also filmed another Dutch film that",
    "Hi everyone, \n\nI'm not exactly sure where to start, but I've recently encountered a situation that's beginning to affect my peace of mind and I feel it's important to put this out here, hoping for some decent advice.\n\nIt's a long story but to be concise, I have a 'friend' who's been a part of my life for a good while. Everything was going fine until a few months back when they started to act differently. This person began subtly hinting at knowing personal aspects of my life that I'd never divulged to anyone. \n\nThe whole situation heightened a couple of weeks ago when they started making comments about my past experiences that I had kept from the public. Comments aside, they started sending me veiled threats in a way that could not be directly attributable as threats in front of others. It's esoteric references, timed messages with an ominous tone, and suggestive phrases that seem sinister to me, but might seem harmless to an outside observer. \n\nI feel cornered and the psychological manipulation feels real. Obviously, this could be a case of misunderstanding since there's no real, tangible threat yet and I could be simply overthinking this. On the other hand, the fear and anxiety have started to feel very real. I haven't reacted or confronted them yet because, honestly, I have no idea how to handle this situation.\n\nI'm writing this to ask if anyone else has been in a similar situation or may know what I should do next. Also, I haven’t involved the local authorities yet because I fear this may not be considered a tangible threat legally. Any advice will be greatly appreciated and will go a long way in helping me regain some semblance of control over my life.\n\nStay safe,\nA worried Reddit user.",
    "This is an honest, but not entirely well-sourced, review of a horror movie in which a young filmmaker's attempts to produce a horror movie are ruined by a mysterious demon that only appears in sleep.\n\nThis is probably the best review I've ever written. No seriously, it may be the best review I've ever written.\n\nAnd then came the ending.\n\nThat thing I just said doesn't seem so great now does it?\n\nNo. Not really.\n\nBecause that wasn't the ending of the film at all. It's actually the most important thing about that thing I mentioned at the start of this rant.\n\nSo, for me, \"Scream\" is all about that ending. The one part that makes absolutely no sense. It's probably the most frustrating thing about the whole package.\n\nAnd what's the last thing in the movie that makes absolutely no sense?\n\nThat's right. It's the ending. The ending that was the end of the movie.\n\n\"Scream\" was about what happens when the storyteller stops trying to make a scary movie and starts trying to make a good one. When the writer realizes that he is no longer the master of the horror because his subjects are more experienced, more talented, far more intelligent than he is.\n\nOf course, the writer is right to know that there are better stories. Those stories are just out there, waiting to be told by somebody else.\n\nThe one part of \"Scream\" that made no sense\n\nThe thing about horror stories that I find particularly frustrating is that so many of them are really no more than a collection of tropes. Some clichés make the movie scary somehow. There's a character that has an unexplained connection with the main character. There are all sorts of weird things going on in this house.\n\nWhat we think is bad in it is really just a way for somebody else to tell a story. There's nothing particularly scary or clever about it. It's just a collection of the same things that are usually in every other movie and TV show.\n\nBut there are two things which make \"Scream\" really frustrating in my opinion.\n\nThe first is that the director, Leigh Whannell, apparently doesn't have a clue what is scary about horror. He never once shows the audience something weird or fre",
    "NEW YORK — Worldcom chief executive Bernard Ebbers allegedly told accountants on his former company’s books to \"leave everything alone\". Worldcom filed for bankruptcy protection this month after reporting that in the past two years it had mis-stated its accounts by some $4bn.\nNEW YORK -- WorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers allegedly told accountants on his former company's books to \"leave everything alone.\"\nWorldCom filed for bankruptcy protection this month after reporting that in the past two years it had misstated its accounts by some $4bn.\nThe New York Times yesterday quoted people at the collapsed telecoms group saying that the orders related to accounting practices in 1999 and 2000.\nOne source said Ebbers had reportedly told WorldCom's accountants: \"Leave everything alone.\" The sources were apparently former employees who either worked for the company or were closely connected with it.\nA US grand jury is looking into WorldCom's accounting practices. The company has said it had been co-operating fully and \"is committed to helping the government in its investigation of the accounting matters at WorldCom and with any other inquiries related to the company.\"\nEbbers, 61, has not been formally accused of any wrongdoing.\n\"They are not going to have to do anything to WorldCom,\" one source told the newspaper. \"They're not going to have to look at the accounting. It's already been done for them.\"\nWorldCom's former auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP, have admitted to destroying records relating to the company.\nUnder bankruptcy protection, all lawsuits againstWorldCom will be temporarily suspended.\n\"There are over 50,000 claims. By freezing them, you are providing the company time to go through the bankruptcy process,\" said Joseph Rosenbaum, a spokesman for the bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York, where WorldCom filed.\n\"The idea is to put the company back on a firm footing.\" WorldCom said this week it would seek further funding and would seek to sell assets. Its stock, meanwhile, continues to fall.\nShare values declined about 5% on Monday to $0.09, while shares that represent WorldCom's debt were down about 3%.\nThe telecoms group now owes $20bn more than it is worth. WorldCom had been attempting a debt-for-equity swap to reduce the amount, but this"
