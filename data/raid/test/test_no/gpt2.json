    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type.

To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection.

Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects.

    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions.

    "Many deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation involve a Fully\nConvolutional Neural Network (FCN) followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF)\nto carry out inference over an image.

We therefore suggest incorporating\ninto the inference algorithm additional higher-order potentials inspired by the\nway humans identify and localize parts. We incorporate two relations that were\nshown to be useful to human object identification - containment and attachment\n- into the energy term of the CRF and evaluate their performance on the Pascal\nVOC Parts dataset.

The model is trained jointly in a multi-task learning setting.\nIn this paper, we propose Mixed-Supervised Dual-Network (MSDN), a novel\narchitecture which consists of two separate networks for the detection and\nsegmentation tasks respectively, and a series of connection modules between the\nlayers of the two networks. These connection modules are used to transfer\nuseful information from the auxiliary detection task to help the segmentation\ntask.

    "  We introduce a high-level graphical framework for designing and analysing\nquantum error correcting codes, centred on what we term the coherent parity\ncheck (CPC).

We show how CSS codes form a subset of CPC codes and, more\ngenerally, how to compute stabilizers for a CPC code. As an explicit example of\nthis framework, we give a method for turning almost any pair of classical\n[n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code. Further, we give a simple\ntechnique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and\ndemonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally, we use the\ngraphical tools to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within\nCPC codes. As our framework gives a new tool for constructing small- to\nmedium-sized codes with relatively high code rates, it provides a new source\nfor codes that could be suitable for emerging devices, while its zx-calculus\nfoundations enable natural integration of error correction with graphical\ncompiler toolchains. It also provides a powerful framework for reasoning about\nall stabilizer quantum error correction codes of any size.\n",
    "Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional\nnetworks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling\nlayers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to\npredictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has\nattempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or\nMRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between\nobjects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these\nproblems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The\ndownside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than\ntraditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.\n  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk\nNetwork (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and\nspatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity.\nOur proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and\nsemantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk\nlayer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the\nnetwork. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix\nmultiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks\nand it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard\nback-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional\nparameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces\nan improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.",

So this can be understood as one\napplication of Floer theory and the theory of $\\infty$-categories in basic\ndifferential geometry. We also develop, based on this $\\infty$-categorical\nFukaya theory, some basic new integer valued invariants of smooth manifolds,\ncalled quantum obstruction. On the way we also construct what we call quantum\nMaslov classes, which are higher degree variants of the relative Seidel\nmorphism. This also leads to new applications in Hofer geometry of the space of\nLagrangian equators in $S^2$.\n",

    "Most progress in semantic segmentation reports on daytime images taken under\nfavorable illumination conditions. We instead address the problem of semantic\nsegmentation of nighttime images and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting\ndaytime models to nighttime without using nighttime annotations. Moreover, we\ndesign a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of\nsemantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum\nframework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night via\nlabeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively\ndarker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspondences for the\nreal images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel\nuncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic\nsegmentation, designed for adverse conditions and including image regions\nbeyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion;\n3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which comprises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920\nunlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts\nplus a set of 151 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created\nwith our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark to perform our novel\nevaluation. Experiments show that our guided curriculum adaptation\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real nighttime sets both\nfor standard metrics and our uncertainty-aware metric. Furthermore, our\nuncertainty-aware evaluation reveals that selective invalidation of predictions\ncan lead to better results on data with ambiguous content such as our nighttime\nbenchmark and profit safety-oriented applications which involve invalid inputs.",
    "  Granular materials do not flow homogeneously like fluids when submitted to\nexternal stress,but often form rigid regions that are separated by narrow shear\nbands where the material yields and flows. This shear localization impacts\ntheir apparent rheology, which makes it difficult to infer a constitutive\nbehaviour from conventional rheometric measurements. Moreover, they present a\ndilatant behaviour, which makes their study in classical fixedvolume geometries\ndifficult. These features led to perform extensive studies with inclined plane\nflows, which were of crucial importance for the development and the validation\nof the $\\mu(I)$ rheology. Our aim is to develop a method to characterize\ngranular materials with rheometrical tools. Using unusual rheometry\nmeasurements in an annular shear cell adapted from Boyer et al.

    "Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a\nnatural language expression.

To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective\nby decoupling it into a \"Locate-Then-Segment\" (LTS) scheme. Given a language\nexpression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding\ntarget image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object\nbased on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual\nfeatures to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model\ninteraction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with\nposition prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a\nlight-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly\neffective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+\nand +3.4% on RefCOCOg).

The method partitions a QLF image into segments of uniform texture and\nintensity called superpixels; every superpixel is statistically modeled as a\nrealization of a single 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) whose parameters\nare estimated; the superpixel is then assigned to one of three classes\n(background, biofilm, tooth substratum) based on the training set of data.

In this paper, a novel\napproach for clustering based image segmentation is proposed. Here, we give\nimportance on color space and choose lab for this task. The famous hard\nclustering algorithm K-means is used, but as its performance is dependent on\nchoosing a proper distance measure, so, we go for cosine distance measure. Then\nthe segmented image is filtered with sobel filter. The filtered image is\nanalyzed with marker watershed algorithm to have the final segmented result of\nour original image. The MSE and PSNR values are evaluated to observe the\nperformance.",
    "Class imbalance has emerged as one of the major challenges for medical image\nsegmentation. The model cascade (MC) strategy significantly alleviates the\nclass imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for\ncoarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this\nmethod leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation\namong the models. To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model,\ni.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better\nthan MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net\nintegrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists\nof shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific\nparameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively\noptimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design\nboth an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based\ntraining strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between\ntasks and design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can\nadaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the\ncategory-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing\nmethod is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most\nimpressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing\nset and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed approaches, we\nalso won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating\nteams. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/chenhong-zhou/OM-Net.",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks have driven substantial advancements in\nthe automatic understanding of images. Requiring a large collection of images\nand their associated annotations is one of the main bottlenecks limiting the\nadoption of deep networks. In the task of medical image segmentation, requiring\npixel-level semantic annotations performed by human experts exacerbate this\ndifficulty. This paper proposes a new framework to train a fully convolutional\nsegmentation network from a large set of cheap unreliable annotations and a\nsmall set of expert-level clean annotations. We propose a spatially adaptive\nreweighting approach to treat clean and noisy pixel-level annotations\ncommensurately in the loss function. We deploy a meta-learning approach to\nassign higher importance to pixels whose loss gradient direction is closer to\nthose of clean data. Our experiments on training the network using segmentation\nground truth corrupted with different levels of annotation noise show how\nspatial reweighting improves the robustness of deep networks to noisy\nannotations.",
    "Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely\napplied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively\nand be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a\ngood machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good\nmodel training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the\nperformance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the\nmachine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each\nprocedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training\ndata ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information\nfor the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each\nmodel or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model\ncapture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can\nprovide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible\nlocal optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in\nmachine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the\ndiversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically\nsummarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and\ninference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In\naddition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the\nmachine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing\nimaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation,\nobject detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some\nchallenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some\ndirections in future work.",
    "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a image into different\nregions or groups based on some characteristics like color, texture, motion or\nshape etc. Active contours is a popular variational method for object\nsegmentation in images, in which the user initializes a contour which evolves\nin order to optimize an objective function designed such that the desired\nobject boundary is the optimal solution. Recently, imaging modalities that\nproduce Manifold valued images have come up, for example, DT-MRI images, vector\nfields. The traditional active contour model does not work on such images. In\nthis paper, we generalize the active contour model to work on Manifold valued\nimages. As expected, our algorithm detects regions with similar Manifold values\nin the image. Our algorithm also produces expected results on usual gray-scale\nimages, since these are nothing but trivial examples of Manifold valued images.\nAs another application of our general active contour model, we perform texture\nsegmentation on gray-scale images by first creating an appropriate Manifold\nvalued image. We demonstrate segmentation results for manifold valued images\nand texture images.",
    "Brain extraction is a fundamental step for most brain imaging studies. In\nthis paper, we investigate the problem of skull stripping and propose\ncomplementary segmentation networks (CompNets) to accurately extract the brain\nfrom T1-weighted MRI scans, for both normal and pathological brain images. The\nproposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and\nhave two pathways to learn features from both the brain tissue and its\ncomplementary part located outside of the brain. The complementary pathway\nextracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to\nbrain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training\ndataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on\nthe OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the\ntwo-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is\nverified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its\ninvariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network\ndesign is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation\nproblems with better generalization.",
    "We introduce the concept of derivate-based component-trees for images with an\narbitrary number of channels. The approach is a natural extension of the\nclassical component-tree devoted to gray-scale images. The similar structure\nenables the translation of many gray-level image processing techniques based on\nthe component-tree to hyperspectral and color images. As an example\napplication, we present an image segmentation approach that extracts Maximally\nStable Homogeneous Regions (MSHR). The approach very similar to MSER but can be\napplied to images with an arbitrary number of channels. As opposed to MSER, our\napproach implicitly segments regions with are both lighter and darker than\ntheir background for gray-scale images and can be used in OCR applications\nwhere MSER will fail. We introduce a local flooding-based immersion for the\nderivate-based component-tree construction which is linear in the number of\npixels. In the experiments, we show that the runtime scales favorably with an\nincreasing number of channels and may improve algorithms which build on MSER.",
    "  A distributed adaptive algorithm is proposed to solve a node-specific\nparameter estimation problem where nodes are interested in estimating\nparameters of local interest, parameters of common interest to a subset of\nnodes and parameters of global interest to the whole network. To address the\ndifferent node-specific parameter estimation problems, this novel algorithm\nrelies on a diffusion-based implementation of different Least Mean Squares\n(LMS) algorithms, each associated with the estimation of a specific set of\nlocal, common or global parameters. Coupled with the estimation of the\ndifferent sets of parameters, the implementation of each LMS algorithm is only\nundertaken by the nodes of the network interested in a specific set of local,\ncommon or global parameters. The study of convergence in the mean sense reveals\nthat the proposed algorithm is asymptotically unbiased. Moreover, a\nspatial-temporal energy conservation relation is provided to evaluate the\nsteady-state performance at each node in the mean-square sense. Finally, the\ntheoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed technique are\nvalidated through computer simulations in the context of cooperative spectrum\nsensing in Cognitive Radio networks.\n",
    "  The $A_\\infty$ T-system, also called the octahedron recurrence, is a\ndynamical recurrence relation. It can be realized as mutation in a\ncoefficient-free cluster algebra (Kedem 2008, Di Francesco and Kedem 2009). We\ndefine T-systems with principal coefficients from cluster algebra aspect, and\ngive combinatorial solutions with respect to any valid initial condition in\nterms of partition functions of perfect matchings, non-intersecting paths and\nnetworks. This also provides a solution to other systems with various choices\nof coefficients on T-systems including Speyer's octahedron recurrence (Speyer\n2007), generalized lambda-determinants (Di Francesco 2013) and (higher)\npentagram maps (Schwartz 1992, Ovsienko et al. 2010, Glick 2011, Gekhtman et\nal. 2014).\n",
    "  We characterize Leavitt path algebras which are Rickart, Baer, and Baer\n$*$-rings in terms of the properties of the underlying graph. In order to treat\nnon-unital Leavitt path algebras as well, we generalize these\nannihilator-related properties to locally unital rings and provide a more\ngeneral characterizations of Leavitt path algebras which are locally Rickart,\nlocally Baer, and locally Baer $*$-rings. Leavitt path algebras are also graded\nrings and we formulate the graded versions of these annihilator-related\nproperties and characterize Leavitt path algebras having those properties as\nwell.\n  Our characterizations provide a quick way to generate a wide variety of\nexamples of rings. For example, creating a Baer and not a Baer $*$-ring, a\nRickart $*$-ring which is not Baer, or a Baer and not a Rickart $*$-ring, is\nstraightforward using the graph-theoretic properties from our results. In\naddition, our characterizations showcase more properties which distinguish\nbehavior of Leavitt path algebras from their $C^*$-algebra counterparts. For\nexample, while a graph $C^*$-algebra is Baer (and a Baer $*$-ring) if and only\nif the underlying graph is finite and acyclic, a Leavitt path algebra is Baer\nif and only if the graph is finite and no cycle has an exit, and it is a Baer\n$*$-ring if and only if the graph is a finite disjoint union of graphs which\nare finite and acyclic or loops.\n",
    "We present Convolutional Oriented Boundaries (COB), which produces multiscale\noriented contours and region hierarchies starting from generic image\nclassification Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). COB is computationally\nefficient, because it requires a single CNN forward pass for multi-scale\ncontour detection and it uses a novel sparse boundary representation for\nhierarchical segmentation; it gives a significant leap in performance over the\nstate-of-the-art, and it generalizes very well to unseen categories and\ndatasets. Particularly, we show that learning to estimate not only contour\nstrength but also orientation provides more accurate results. We perform\nextensive experiments for low-level applications on BSDS, PASCAL Context,\nPASCAL Segmentation, and NYUD to evaluate boundary detection performance,\nshowing that COB provides state-of-the-art contours and region hierarchies in\nall datasets. We also evaluate COB on high-level tasks when coupled with\nmultiple pipelines for object proposals, semantic contours, semantic\nsegmentation, and object detection on MS-COCO, SBD, and PASCAL; showing that\nCOB also improves the results for all tasks.",
    "Semi-supervised learning has recently been attracting attention as an\nalternative to fully supervised models that require large pools of labeled\ndata.

    "While making a tremendous impact in various fields, deep neural networks\nusually require large amounts of labeled data for training which are expensive\nto collect in many applications, especially in the medical domain. Unlabeled\ndata, on the other hand, is much more abundant. Semi-supervised learning\ntechniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage\nunlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware\nmulti-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data,\nsuch as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is\nachieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate\ndifferent views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical\n3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In\naddition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate\nthe reliability of each view's prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one\nview requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our\nself-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each\nunlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach\ncan take advantage of unlabeled data during training. We show the effectiveness\nof our proposed semi-supervised method on several public datasets from medical\nimage segmentation tasks (NIH pancreas & LiTS liver tumor dataset). Meanwhile,\na fully-supervised method based on our approach achieved state-of-the-art\nperformances on both the LiTS liver tumor segmentation and the Medical\nSegmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, demonstrating the robustness and value\nof our framework, even when fully supervised training is feasible.",
    "We introduce a novel Deep Learning framework, which quantitatively estimates\nimage segmentation quality without the need for human inspection or labeling.\nWe refer to this method as a Quality Assurance Network -- QANet. Specifically,\ngiven an image and a `proposed' corresponding segmentation, obtained by any\nmethod including manual annotation, the QANet solves a regression problem in\norder to estimate a predefined quality measure with respect to the unknown\nground truth. The QANet is by no means yet another segmentation method.\nInstead, it performs a multi-level, multi-feature comparison of an\nimage-segmentation pair based on a unique network architecture, called the\nRibCage.\n  To demonstrate the strength of the QANet, we addressed the evaluation of\ninstance segmentation using two different datasets from different domains,\nnamely, high throughput live cell microscopy images from the Cell Segmentation\nBenchmark and natural images of plants from the Leaf Segmentation Challenge.\nWhile synthesized segmentations were used to train the QANet, it was tested on\nsegmentations obtained by publicly available methods that participated in the\ndifferent challenges. We show that the QANet accurately estimates the scores of\nthe evaluated segmentations with respect to the hidden ground truth, as\npublished by the challenges' organizers.\n  The code is available at: TBD.",
    "Person re-identification is becoming a hot research for developing both\nmachine learning algorithms and video surveillance applications. The task of\nperson re-identification is to determine which person in a gallery has the same\nidentity to a probe image. This task basically assumes that the subject of the\nprobe image belongs to the gallery, that is, the gallery contains this person.\nHowever, in practical applications such as searching a suspect in a video, this\nassumption is usually not true. In this paper, we consider the open-set person\nre-identification problem, which includes two sub-tasks, detection and\nidentification. The detection sub-task is to determine the presence of the\nprobe subject in the gallery, and the identification sub-task is to determine\nwhich person in the gallery has the same identity as the accepted probe. We\npresent a database collected from a video surveillance setting of 6 cameras,\nwith 200 persons and 7,413 images segmented. Based on this database, we develop\na benchmark protocol for evaluating the performance under the open-set person\nre-identification scenario. Several popular metric learning algorithms for\nperson re-identification have been evaluated as baselines. From the baseline\nperformance, we observe that the open-set person re-identification problem is\nstill largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed.",

    "All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday.\nMoazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US for almost three years. They were detained in the Cuban camp as part of the US-led \"war on terror\". Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after \"intensive and complex discussions\" over security. He said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003. All four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government, Mr Straw said.\nBut he added: \"Once they are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity.\" The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the return of the four detainees. But he said there were still \"serious questions\" both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said the four had been rescued from a \"legal no-man's land\". \"Their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process.\"\nAzmat Begg, father of Moazzam, thanked his lawyers and the British people for the support he had received while campaigning for his son's release. He added: \"If they have done something wrong, of course they should be punished, but if they haven't, they shouldn't have been there.\" Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. She said: \"They should at the outset have said quite clearly to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down. \"They didn't do that. They colluded with it.\" Moazzam Begg's Labour MP Roger Godsiff welcomed his release, but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges. Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said: \"People get released from prison when it's found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. \"I don't see any difference in this case.\" Human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba. Amnesty International has called Camp Delta a \"major human-rights scandal\" and an \"icon of lawlessness\". Both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as \"long overdue\". Civil rights group Liberty said it was \"delighted\" but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.\nDirector Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to \"practise what it preaches\" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars. The US has also announced that 48-year-old Australian Mamdouh Habib, previously accused of terrorist offences, will be released without charge from Camp Delta. Five British detainees released from Guantanamo in March last year were questioned by UK police before being released without charge.",
    "Technology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.\nThe firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.\nCurrently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy \"appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content\". The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.\nThe move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. \"In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past,\" said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. \"The difference is that it is very fragmented,\" he said. \"It's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race\" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsoft's \"Plays for Sure\" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.\nShelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apple's iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. \"Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods,\" she said.\nShe said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. \"It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,\" she said, \"and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.\" Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. \"People want portability,\" she said, \"and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.\" Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. \"Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,\" he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. \"The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on.\"",

    "Greek athletics' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou for missing doping tests.\nThe pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year's Athens Olympics. They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. \"A decision is now expected by around mid-March,\" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos. Kenteris, 31, who won the men's 200m title at the 2000 Sydney Games and Thanou, 30, who won the women's 100m silver medal in Sydney, face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry.

Jol added: \"We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. \"What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it.\n\"We didn't play particularly well but I am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three.\" Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. He said: \"My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. \"It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. \"It's really, really over.

It's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. \"It's not every game you score from the halfway line.\" Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. \"I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game,\" Ferguson told MUTV. \"What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays. \"But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.\n\"Thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. So you wouldn't be wasting a lot of time. \"I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football.\" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. \"When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence,\" said Wenger. \"It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.\"",

    "UK airport operator BAA has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.\nThe comments come a day ahead of a High Court challenge by residents' groups and local councils to the government's White Paper. The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. \"We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,\" a BAA spokesman said.\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. Among other measures, BAA has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near Stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.\nAt Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was \"fundamentally flawed\" and did not follow the proper consultation process. \"We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government White Paper,\" said Stop Stansted Expansion chairman Peter Sanders said. HACAN chairman John Stewart said: \"Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare. \"It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. \"Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. \" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February.",
    "Allan Scott is confident of winning a medal at next week's European Indoor Championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.\nThe 22-year-old Scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the Jose M Cagigal Memorial meeting in Madrid. \"It was definitely a learning curve and I certainly haven't ruled out challenging for a medal next week,\" said the East Kilbride athlete. The race was won by Felipe Vivancos, who equalled the Spanish record.\nSweden's Robert Kronberg was second, with Haiti's Dudley Dorival in third. Scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. He won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first IAAF Indoor Grand Prix circuit final. \"I should have done better than that,\" he said. \"I felt I could have won it.

    "AC Milan defender Jaap Stam says Manchester United \"know they made a mistake\" by selling him in 2001.\nThe sides meet at Old Trafford in the Champions League game on Wednesday and the 32-year-old's Dutchman's presence is sure to add spice to the fixture. \"United made a mistake in selling me,\" Stam told Uefa's Champions magazine. \"I was settled at Manchester United, but they wanted to sell me. If a club want to sell you, there is nothing you can do. You can be sold like cattle.\" Sir Alex Ferguson surprised the football world - and Stam - by selling the Dutchman to Lazio for £16.5m in August 2001. The decision came shortly after Stam claimed in his autobiography that Ferguson had tapped him up when he was at PSV Eindhoven. But Ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. The affair still rankles with the Dutchman.\n\"I was settled at Manchester United, I had even just ordered a new kitchen, but they wanted to sell me,\" he said. \"In what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes? \"Of course, you can refuse to go, but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. I don't agree that players control the game. \"There have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers, but I have turned them down. What's the point?\"\nWednesday's game at Old Trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between United's young attackers Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and Milan's veteran defence of Stam, Paolo Maldini, Cafu and Alessandro Costacurta. Stam says Rooney's teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game. \"We can't all be Wayne Rooneys - at his age I was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone,\" he said. \"Starting late can be a good thing. Some kids who start early get bored. \"I had my youth - having fun, drinking beers, blowing up milk cannisters. It sounds strange but it's a tradition where I grew up in Kampen - and I had done all the things I wanted to do.\"",
    "Dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, Media Labs Europe, is to shut down.\nThe research centre, which was started by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts. Since its opening in 2000, the centre has developed ideas, such as implants for teeth, and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. The centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. In a statement, Media Labs Europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the Irish Government nor the prestigious US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was willing to fund it. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies, in an attempt to regenerate the area.\nAbout three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the Labs' long-term survival. The Labs needed about 10 million euros (US$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. \"In the end, it was too deep and too long a recession,\" said Simon Jones, the Labs' managing director. Ian Pearson, BT's futurologist, told the BBC News website that the closure was a \"real shame\". BT was just one of the companies that had worked with the Labs, looking at RFID tag developments and video conferencing. \"There were a lot of very talented, creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society. \"I have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost.\"\nNoel Dempsey, the government's communications minister, said Mr Ahern had been \"very committed\" to the project. \"He is, I know, very disappointed it has come to this. At the time it seemed to be the right thing to do,\" he said. \"Unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate.\"\nDuring its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. In recent months, 14 patent applications had been filed by the Labs. Many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. Several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. The Human Connectedness group, for example, developed the iBand, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. This information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. Other projects looked at using other human senses, like touch, to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment, or on the body itself. One project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. The Labs, set up in an old Guinness brewery, housed around 100 people, made up of staff, researchers, students, collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. It is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the Labs close on 1 February. According to its latest accounts, Media Lab Europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about US$10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million euros (US$3.3 million).",

    "A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.\nThe drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits. But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.\nApproximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK. Many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.\nNow, GW Pharma's Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. \"We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,\" said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.\nThe UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex's launch in the UK. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p.",
    "The nuclear unit of Russian energy giant Gazprom is reportedly facing a 1bn rouble ($35.7m; £19.1m) back-tax claim for the 2001-2003 period.\nVedomosti newspaper reported that Russian authorities made the demand at the end of last year. The paper added that most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company's export activity. Gazprom, the biggest gas company in the world, took over nuclear fuel giant Atomstroieksport in October 2004. The main project of Atomstroieksport is the building of a nuclear plant in Iran, which has been a source of tension between Russia and the US.\nGazprom is one of the key players in the complex Russian energy market, where the government of Vladimir Putin has made moves to regain state influence over the sector. Gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm Rosneft, the company that eventually acquired Yuganskneftegas, the main unit of embattled oil giant Yukos. Claims for back-taxes was a tool used against Yukos, and led to the enforced sale Yuganskneftegas. Some analysts fear the Kremlin will continue to use these sort of moves to boost the efforts of the state to regain control over strategically important sectors such as oil.",
    "Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen.\nAlan Archibald prodded United ahead in 19 minutes and James Grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later. Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. Tony Bullock in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley. Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless.\nUnited restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. Jason Scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing Crawford and he coolly beat Ryan Esson from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. Grady received a pass from Crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of Esson. The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from Esson to keep out Robson's drive after 62 minutes. The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area.

    "The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.\nPrivate sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\nThe ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\n\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\nA slowdown in the housing market and this year's surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"",
    "UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered £960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.\nIn a speech, he called for action to reach the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. Mr Brown has just returned from a tour of African nations. The £1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health.\nThe chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK's Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday. Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra £0.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation. That could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. As well as pledging £960m over 15 years to the immunisation IFF, Britain urged other donors to contribute.\nIf Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued. Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. War on Want's John Hilary said: \"Compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. \"As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.\"",
    "Belgian brewing giant Inbev has seen its profits soar thanks to its acquisition of Brazil's biggest beer firm Ambev last year.\nInbev, which makes Stella Artois, said pre-tax profits for 2004 rose 56% to 1.16bn euros ($1.5bn; £800m), and said it expected solid growth in 2005. The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",

They also have a good record at the Stade de France, having won their first two games there, in 1999 and 2001. Wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed Italy 38-8 in Rome.\nKevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing.

    "You can now buy \"trusted computers\", but can we really trust the PC vendors, asks technology analyst Bill Thompson.\nIf you have recently bought an IBM ThinkVantage computer, a Dell Optiplex, or one of a whole range of laptops from Toshiba, HP/Compaq or Samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (TPM) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to children's toys. But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. And as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. A big advantage of the TPM is that it is hardware-based.\nAt the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. It might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor.\nHardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. This is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers. As a result we settle for second best. So when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward. After all, if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. And if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. Instead you have to use special software, like HP's ProtectTools or Wave Systems' Embassy. This provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks. Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows, \"Longhorn\". This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the \"Next Generation Secure Computing Base\", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. However there is a downside to the increased security from viruses, spyware and data theft that this will provide.\nBecause the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (DRM) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them. We have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. Users of Apple's iTunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other iTunes users, a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection.\nBut the latest version of iTunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a CD. Another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from Real's Harmony service on your iPod. Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. Similarly, users of TiVo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows, and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it. One wonders whether hardware-based DRM will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. It will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. Once it is unlocked then someone, somewhere, will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. And once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. The efforts going into DRM would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. The record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us, most of the time, will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. They will benefit more by building a market in which I can share songs with my friends, record shows I want to watch later, and burn CDs for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.",
    "Britain has offered to send a company of 120 Gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia, Downing Street said.\nThe deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province. Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.\nHowever a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in Indonesia which the Gurkhas might be able to help with. The spokesman said: \"Following this morning's daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort, the government has formally offered the Indonesian government the assistance of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters. \"This is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean.\"\nIndonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami, with 94,000 of the 140,000 confirmed deaths so far. International Development Minister Gareth Thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of Aceh. \"We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment,\" he said. \"We've also had RAF aircraft flying in equipment which the UN desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in Aceh province as well.\" The offer comes as the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw arrives in Indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast.

    "Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\"",
    "Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was \"out of control\" during the \"wild\" 1960s.\nLucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as \"Precious\" at school. Despite being told he was a \"nutter who died at sea\" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound found out about it last year. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.\nMr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: \"I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead.\" He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a \"set-up\" but he then realised all the dates fitted. \"It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,\" said the Ealing North MP. \"I don't blame Lucy's mother. I was pretty much out of control. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.\"\nMr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since. Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: \"The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. \"We were finishing each other sentences.\" Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.",
    "Japan's box office received a 3.8% boost last year, with ticket sales worth 211bn yen (£1.08bn).\nThe surge was led by animated movie Howl's Moving Castle, which took 20bn yen (£102m) to become the biggest film in Japan in 2004. It is expected to match the 30.7bn yen (£157m) record of Hayao Miyazaki's previous film Spirited Away. Japan Motion Picture Producers figures showed that 170 million cinema admissions were made in Japan in 2004. The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, was the biggest foreign movie hit in Japan last year, taking 13.8bn yen (£70.7m).\nIt was followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Finding Nemo and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The second highest-grossing Japanese film was romantic drama Crying Out Love in the Centre of the World, followed by Be With You and Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation. Japanese films accounted for 37.5% of Japan's box office total last year, with foreign films taking the remaining 62.5%. This represented a 4.5% gain for the proportion of Japanese films in 2004 compared to 2003. The number of Japanese films released rose to 310 in 2004 from 287 the previous year. Sales of movies on DVD and video amounted to 497bn yen (£2.54bn) for the year.",
    "Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be \"the most accessible browser on the market\", according to its authors.\nThe latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"\nAnother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.\nThe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "Stan Lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit Spider-Man movies.\nMany marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stan Lieberman, got a job in Timely Publications, a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, now legally adopted.\nBy the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\nLee's answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee's life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York's skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\n\"Just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee's influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.\nIn 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. His latest project is a superhero based on a real person - Jay J Armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. But his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, The Hulk and Daredevil have all been turned into Hollywood action movies in the last five years. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. It seems Stan Lee is as indestructible as his heroes.",
    "One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.\nYoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan's most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\nMr Tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn't let me use the silk futon, saying it's a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan's troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank's bad loans.",

    "Ulster clung on for a morale-boosting Celtic League win over bottom club Borders at Netherdale on Friday night.\nA late try by Borders substitute Jonny Weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the Scottish side could not complete the fightback. Ulster had led 20-6 with tries from Paul Steinmetz and Bryn Cunningham. But the Irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. Calum MacRae surrendered possession before centre Steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. Substitute Joe Pattison - who had come on for the injured Gareth Morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.\nThe speedy Steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving Adam Larkin an easy conversion. Ally Warnock clawed back three points for Borders, but they were soon hit by another double-blow. First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward. Larkin again added the extras. Even worse was to come for Borders when Larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to Kelly Brown being sin-binned. The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end. And he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory. \"Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time,\" said McCall. \"In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.\"\nMorton, Moffat, MacRae, Hore, Berthinussen, Warnock, Moore, Thomson, Ford, Douglas, Blair, Stewart, Gray, Brown, McEntee.\nKay, Parr, McGee, Rennick, Weston, Millar, Pattison.\nCunningham, Maxwell, Bell, Steinmetz, Howe, Larkin, Campbell, S.

Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March. \"I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen,\" Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday. \"I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago.

    "Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\nTreasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare.\n- Increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60,000 \n - A freeze on petrol duty \n - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \n - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than £60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to £150,000 in February.\nThe Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn.\"\nBut Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\nFor the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a £2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.",
    "Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was \"one of the proudest nights of my career.\"\nThe Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: \"It was a really great night. \"The players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans. \"We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances. For Liverpool, this result is very, very important.\" Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. The Reds scored three second-half goals in a sensational comeback capped by Gerrard's 20-yard drive. He added: \"Steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game.\n\"I have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us. \"I felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters, I cannot thank them enough. \"I want to say thank-you to the supporters, they were magnificent to help us achieve this result.\" Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time. He said: \"I'd be lying if I thought we were going through when we were losing at half-time.\n\"We had a mountain to climb, but we have climbed it and credit to everyone. \"That was one of the best goals I have scored, I caught it sweet, I haven't caught one like that for ages.

    "Music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.\nThe debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser's dream come true and a branding nightmare. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing 'oxygen' for companies that support illegal downloading. \"You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,\" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.\nHe urged people to follow his lead and 'dump' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. 'Networks like eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses,\" it said. But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\nThe reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. \"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,\" he said. \"If you put the legality issues aside, not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience,\" he added. Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical. \"We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. It is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks,\" read a statement from the discount phone firm. It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.\nHowever Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said. \"I would be surprised if these brands didn't have the know-how to prevent this happening,\" he said. At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. \"Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity, including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - Senator John Kerry and President George W. Bush,\" said chief executive Sam Yagan. There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network, he thinks. \"Peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they're most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media,\" he said.",

But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.\n\"You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible,\" says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. \"It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.\" Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.\nMainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing \"export quality\" rap.\nThe web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its \"infant stage\". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. \"He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,\" Millan says. \"He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world.\" Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. \"Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,\" Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.\nBut one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. \"It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now,\" Millan says. \"And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing.\" Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.",
    "More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests.\nTheir biggest worries are not terror threats, but over-regulation, low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.\nGlobal business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandals in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. Across Europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called IFRS. Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.\nAlready, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a \"significant threat\" or \"one of the biggest threats\". But PwC's global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.\nAccording to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: \"One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won't kill your business anymore.\" Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. Mr DiPiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had \"adjusted\" to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.\n - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.",
    "Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said.\nHowl's Moving Castle set a Japanese box office record last week, taking 1.5bn yen (£7.7m) in its first two days. Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. Howl's Moving Castle is based on a children's fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones. It tells the story of an 18-year-old woman who ages dramatically after falling under a witch's spell. She heads to a moving castle kept by Howl, a wizard, and searches for a way to become normal again. A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film \"has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike\". \"We have a good feeling about this film. We saw very good viewer response,\" he added. The film's worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January.",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\nSlower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\nAnd recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\nBusiness groups welcomed the MPC's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"",
    "Aston Villa's Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.\nThe striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. \"Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge,\" said Villa boss David O'Leary. \"I won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea.\" Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because O'Leary had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villa's manager's problems in that department.",
    "The US has pushed Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, under the US Department of Energy. IBM test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The previous top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocked up 35.86. The Top 500 list was announced on Monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world.\nIt is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second.\nOnce completed in 2005, Blue Gene/L will be more powerful than its current prototype. \"Next year with the final Blue Gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat,\" said Erich Strohmaier, one of the co-founders of the Top500 list. It will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers.\nIn second place was Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at the US space agency's (Nasa) Ames Research Center in California. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second (teraflops) in October. It will be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The defeated Japanese contender, the Earth Simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity.\nSince the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.\nThe draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. \"There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,\" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.\nIn December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.",
    "Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet \"rogue-dialling\" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.\nIt has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge. Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. They must warn people earlier about possible fraud, Icstis said.\nPeople who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. Victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: \"Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. \"If my bill goes over the usual £50 a month I want to know about it straight away - I don't want to be told when it's hit £750.\"\nPhone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said. \"We alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers,\" he added.\nTelecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said: \"Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary. \"So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach.\" The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.\nGavin Patterson, group managing director for BT Consumer, said \"We do look at customer's calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. \"We're looking at the moment at whether we can improve this.\" But as BT handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was \"quite a task in itself\", he added. The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. At the moment, it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down.\nI use free anti-virus software (AVG) and free firewall protection (ZoneAlarm). Both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter's love of music sites. How about ISPs informing all customers of such facilities? The responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues.\nIgnorance is and always has been an expensive business.\nDoes any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised? The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ?\nThese diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal MP3s, porn and pirated software. If people didn't visit such sites they'd be considerably less at risk. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? It seems everyone has to be a 'victim' these days!\nPart of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. A secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user's knowledge.\nThese scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. They should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. Or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going?\nWhy don't BT et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request? To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. After you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions, they cannot insist on you paying the bill. To do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. No customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills.\nDisable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. Or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. You would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your PC? Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault!\nI was very impressed with our phone company recently. I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number. Great service. And I got the tickets as well!\nI have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. Three months later another huge bill of over £1,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place. Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.\nI have been scammed of £139. The operator will do nothing about this and, to add insult to injury, I was charged VAT by the government.\nPremium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.\nI know people who have run up large bills, despite being IT-literate. From talking to BT in Belfast, I believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. It's not the fault of phone companies, and at last they are doing something about it.\nIt's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! Not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly.\nI haven't \"fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam\" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. In most cases the user is entirely at fault, which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them.\nMy telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal £3 to £5, to £320. This was because of the scam. They simply billed me. What particularly galls me, over and above having over £300 stolen, is that the supplier and the government (through VAT) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses.\nHow about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted? That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. At least any disputed amount would be limited, far easier for a telecoms operator to write off £20 than it is £750.\nA few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection.\nHow about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date? That should prevent the vast majority of these scams.",
    "Shares in Cairn Energy, a UK oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.\nThe company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable. Cairn's shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year. Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he was \"disappointed\" with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan. Investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a \"significant downgrade of the initial expectation\".\nCairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. The company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; £10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. A spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field's current value.\n\"Cairn refutes the government's position,\" Mr Gammell said. He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - India's state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - and not the contractor. \"We have a pretty strong legal case here,\" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statements though. The shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. \"I think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,\" said analyst Jason Kenney at ING.\nThe disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for Cairn's existing oilfields. The company raised targets for its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in India from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. \"These two fields will provide the core of the future developments in Rajasthan,\" Mr Gammell said. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to South Asia from interests in the US and Europe. Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.",

Sony has billed the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan.

    "Shares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had deepened to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m.\nThe UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and \"operating flaws\" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.",
    "Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan has praised striker Robbie Fowler for his landmark return to form.\nThe 29-year-old, out of favour at City earlier this season, took his Premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in Monday's 3-2 win at Norwich. \"He is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did,\" Keegan said. \"He has worked hard to get back to where he is now.\" The former Liverpool striker, who moved to City in 2003 after a poor stint at Leeds, has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season.\nFowler overtook Les Ferdinand on Tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the Premiership, with 151 goals, and he only trails Alan Shearer (250) and Andy Cole (173). And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward. \"He can get better if we can supply him better,\" added Keegan. \"People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face.\" Fowler's double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards. \"I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington,\" he said. \"His team have got great character, they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm. \"I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership. \"The stadium and the atmosphere is great, it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know.\"",
    "Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, D dal Maso, P Griffen, M Barbini, KP Robertson.\nG Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.\nR McBryde, J Yapp, I Gough, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, K Morgan.\nAndrew Cole (Australia).",
    "Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner.\nGlobally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly \"must-have\" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.\nCamera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.\nMobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.\nImages from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.\nThe exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said.",
    "David Beckham expressed his relief at Real Madrid's passage to the Champions League knockout phase.\nAfter Real's 3-0 win at Roma, the England skipper admitted another season of under-achievement would not be tolerated at the Bernabeu stadium. Beckham said: \"It's expected of Madrid to get through, but it's a relief for the club and players to have won. \"We lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything.\" Real's finish as runners-up in their Champions League group means they cannot face his old club Manchester United in the next round. But Real could be drawn against other Premiership hopefuls, Arsenal or Chelsea, who won their respective groups. \"It's going to be great whoever we play, even if we don't get either of the two English teams.\"",
    "Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.\nThe Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets. The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current £7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.\nFor many deaf people, especially those born deaf, BSL is a first and preferred means of communication.\nUntil now, the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator. \"In the past, I've used textphones but they have problems,\" said Robert Currington who is taking part in the pilot. \"I communicate in BSL; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message.\" \"I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply.\" The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call. \"There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people,\" said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels. \"In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. \"By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group.\"\nOfcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. And new technology, including the Video Relay Service, will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. But a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation. \"Any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider,\" he said. Mr Currington, like many of the UK's 70,000 BSL users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available. \"The relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure,\" he said. \"I can show my emotions more easily in BSL in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls.\"",
    "Pop singer Delta Goodrem has scooped one of the top individual prizes at the first Australian MTV Music Awards.\nThe 21-year-old singer won the award for best female artist, with Australian Idol runner-up Shannon Noll taking the title of best male at the ceremony. Goodrem, known in both Britain and Australia for her role as Nina Tucker in TV soap Neighbours, also performed a duet with boyfriend Brian McFadden. Other winners included Green Day, voted best group, and the Black Eyed Peas. Goodrem, Green Day and the Black Eyed Peas took home two awards each. As well as best female, Goodrem also took home the Pepsi Viewers Choice Award, whilst Green Day bagged the prize for best rock video for American Idiot. The Black Eyed Peas won awards for best R 'n' B video and sexiest video, both for Hey Mama. Local singer and songwriter Missy Higgins took the title of breakthrough artist of the year, with Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian taking the honours for best pop video. The VH1 First Music Award went to Cher honouring her achievements within the music industry. The ceremony was held at the Luna Park fairground in Sydney Harbour and was hosted by the Osbourne family. Artists including Carmen Electra, Missy Higgins, Kelly Osbourne, Green Day, Ja Rule and Natalie Imbruglia gave live performances at the event.",
    "Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.\nInvestors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia's listed firms. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,\" said ABN Amro's Eddie Wong. \"[But] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.\"\nIndia's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\nThailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\nIn the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.\nHowever, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. \"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. \"The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.\nHe told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell said the country's health rates were \"lamentable\" not least because of smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\n - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \n - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \n - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500 \n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \n - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. \n \nMr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.\" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: \"Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.",

    "Carlos Moya described Spain's Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA's challenge in Seville.\nMoya made up for missing Spain's 2000 victory through injury by beating Roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"I have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day,\" said Moya. \"All my energy has been focused on today. \"What I have lived today I do not think I will live again.\" Spain's only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia. And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: \"The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset. \"Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way. It helps me reach my goals if I am obsessed. \"It's really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.\" Spanish captain Jordi Arrese said: \"Charly played a great game. It was his opportunity and he hasn't let us down. \"He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him. \"He had been waiting years to be in this position.\" Spain's victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.\nAged 18 years and 185 days, the Mallorcan became the youngest player to win the Davis Cup. \"What a great way to finish the year,\" said Nadal afterwards. US coach Patrick McEnroe wants Roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. \"I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.\" \"Obviously it's unrealistic to say that we're going to just start playing constantly on clay, with the schedule. \"But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff,\" said McEnroe. Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville's Olympic Stadium. \"It's just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world,\" said the American. \"I had my chances and just didn't convert them. The bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. \"They came out, took care of business and they beat us. It's as simple as that.\"",
    "A senior Tory MP has criticised agriculture department Defra's \"lackadaisical\" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.\nPublic accounts committee chairman Edward Leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The National Audit Office said Defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. But Mr Leigh said the department was \"dragging its heels\".\nThat comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. He also said Defra had been \"dreadfully slow\" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.\nThe outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the UK up to £8bn. \"Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and £40m of invoices remain unpaid,\" Mr Leigh said. Mr Leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an IT system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.\nMinisters had hoped to get £900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. That was because the UK had valued the culled animals at between \"two and three times\" the commission's assessment of their likely market value. National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. On the issue of the unpaid invoices, Sir John said Defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001, \"but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations\".\nMr Leigh said being \"better prepared\" would also help avoid the need for \"mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak\". A Defra spokesman said: \"We welcome the report. It acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak. \"However, the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.\"",
    "Microsoft has entered the desktop search fray, releasing a test version of its tool to find documents, e-mails and other files on a PC hard drive.\nThe beta program only works on PCs running Windows XP or Windows 2000. The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded with firms touting programs that help people find files. Search giant Google launched its desktop search tool in October, while Yahoo is planning to release similar software in January.\n\"Our ambition for search is to provide the ultimate information tool that can find anything you're looking for,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president at Microsoft's MSN internet division. Microsoft's program can be used as a toolbar on the Windows desktop, the Internet Explorer browser and within the Outlook e-mail program. The software giant is coming late to the desktop search arena, competing with a large number of rivals. Google has already released a desktop tool. Yahoo is planning to get into the game in January and AOL is expected to offer desktop searching early next year. Small firms such as Blinkx, Copernic, Enfish X1 Technologies and X-Friend offer tools that catalogue the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer. Apple will release a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to be released with the Tiger operating system.",
    "US hip-hop duo OutKast have capped a year of award glory with three prizes at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.\nThey won best group, best video and best song for hit Hey Ya! after getting five nominations. R&B singer Usher won best male and best album for Confessions, while UK rock band Muse were named best alternative act and best British artists. OutKast will add their awards to the four they won at the US MTV Awards in August and three Grammys in February. Not only was Hey Ya! one of the biggest global hits of last year, but OutKast have been widely acclaimed as one of the most exciting and innovative acts in music. Their double CD album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which saw Andre 3000 and Big Boi each produce one disc, was hailed as the album of 2003 by many critics.\nAndre 3000 thanked fans \"for supporting OutKast throughout the years\". \"We really appreciate it,\" he said. \"I hope you don't get tired of us, but we only do what we do.\" Also competing for best group had been the Beastie Boys, the Black Eyed Peas, D12 and Maroon 5. And Anastacia, Britney Spears, Maroon 5 and Ludacris had been on the shortlist for best song.\nOutKast did lose out in the contest for best album - which was won by Usher, another award favourite. Usher, who performed a duet with Alicia Keys, also beat off competition from Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly and Robbie Williams to take the best male crown. He had four nominations going into the ceremony, with seven artists nominated in three categories.\nEminem's group, D12, were surprise winners in the best hip-hop category, beating the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nelly. Eminem told the crowd: \"D12 finally won an award, thank you very much.\" The rapper opened the show with a performance of his songs Like Toy Soldiers and Just Lose It, for which he was joined on stage by a crowd of children. The Black Eyed Peas - who had a global hit with Where is the Love? - picked up the prize for best pop act, beating Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams and Britney Spears. Spears was named best female, sending a message of thanks on video saying the award \"means so much to me\". Alicia Keys, Anastasia, Avril Lavigne and Beyonce Knowles had featured alongside her in that contest.\nLinkin Park singer Chester Bennington described their prize for best rock band as \"quite an honour\" while Muse said their win for best alternative act was \"a real surprise for us\". Muse were also named best UK and Ireland act, ahead of Franz Ferdinand, Natasha Bedingfield, Jamelia and The Streets. Referring to the fact that winners of 11 of the 12 main awards were from the US, Muse singer Matt Bellamy said: \"There needs to be more European bands.\" The 11th annual awards were hosted by hip-hop artist Xzibit and watched by 6,000 people at the Tor Di Valle arena, plus millions more on TV around the world. The ceremony featured performances from the Beastie Boys, who entered the stage on bicycles and skateboards, No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani being lowered from a giant clock and Nelly doing a duet with Pharrell Williams. MTV also organised a huge open-air concert featuring Anastacia and The Cure outside the Italian capital's ancient Colosseum, with some estimates putting the attendance there at 200,000. Last year's big winner at the MTV Europe Awards, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, was Justin Timberlake, who walked away with three trophies.",

But Dallaglio, who called time on England earlier this year, said: \"I assure you I wouldn't let anyone down. \"I know what it takes and what I have to offer,\" he told the Daily Telegraph. Dallaglio toured South Africa with the Lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to Australia three years ago.\nThe 32-year-old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf-life.

    "The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.\nAgriculture Minister Adamu Bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; £591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.\nCocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. \"People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,\" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. \"The farmers in the village never see any assistance,\" he added.\nAt the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.",
    "Germaine Greer has criticised Celebrity Big Brother's \"bullying\" of housemates after quitting the reality TV show.\nShe said \"superior\" bullying tactics, like making housemates cold and hungry, could encourage playground bullying. She also condemned the \"complete irresponsibility\" of adding Brigitte Nielsen's former mother-in-law Jackie Stallone to the house on Monday. Nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children, Greer said. The feminist writer and broadcaster said Big Brother had behaved \"like a child rather than a parent\" by taunting contestant John McCririck after denying him a cola drink. \"I thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground,\" Greer said. She also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking \"agendas\".\n\"I had no idea who would be in here and it's wrong for me to present myself in the same context as they are.\" Media observers had been surprised by Greer's initial decision to join the third celebrity version of the Channel 4 reality TV show, given that she has written critical articles about the format in the past. As she packed her suitcase to leave the house she told fellow housemates: \"I'm leaving over specific issues, but best for everyone if I don't discuss them. \"I have a problem with decisions, I make them fast and when I make them, I stick to them.\" Greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against Big Brother.\nOther celebrities to walk out of a reality show TV include Sex Pistol John Lydon, former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook and ex-E17 singer Brian Harvey who all left I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Previous Big Brother housemates to leave before their time were Sunita Sharma and Sandy Cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.\nVOTE   Was Germaine Greer right to leave Celebrity Big Brother?   Yes  No   Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion\nHappy Mondays dancer Bez is now 2-1 favourite to win the show, followed by Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie at 5-2 and actor Jeremy Edwards at 4-1. Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush said that the series was still \"wide open\", adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on McCririck slashing his odds to 8-1. DJ Lisa I'Anson is the outsider with odds of 40-1, while Jackie Stallone, who joined the house on Monday, is also one of the less popular housemates at 20-1. The first eviction of the series has now been postponed after Greer's exit unexpectedly reduced the number of competitors. The eight remaining contestants are competing for a £50,000 prize, to be donated to the charity of their choice, if they survive a series of public votes. For every 50p vote cast by viewers by telephone or text during the programme's run, 9p will go to a tsunami charity appeal.",
    "Tony Blair has pledged to \"never, ever, ever\" attack Tory leader Michael Howard over his Jewish beliefs.\nThe prime minister told the Jewish Chronicle: \"If you look at what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically.\" Mr Blair also distanced himself from recent Labour campaign posters featuring Mr Howard, which critics claimed were \"anti-Semitic\". These were \"not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the Jewish community,\" Mr Blair insisted.\nOne poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs. Another pictured the Tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said echoed the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.\nOthers compared the image to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. Labour has since taken the designs of its website, saying members had preferred other designs. During his interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Mr Blair said: \"I've been a very strong supporter of the Jewish community and Israel, and will always be so.\" Pressed on whether he would draw attention to Mr Howard's Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, he replied: \"The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. It's untrue. \"If you look what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically. I would never, ever, ever attack him on that basis.\"\nMr Blair also defended his party's attitude towards the Jewish community, pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the Holocaust Memorial Day. He added that Labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism.\nNeither the Conservatives nor the Liberal Democrats wished to comment on Mr Blair's words. The prime minister was speaking as London's Labour mayor Ken Livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a Jewish reporter from the city's Evening Standard newspaper. Mr Blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter, Oliver Finegold, to a concentration camp guard. Mr Livingstone \"should have withdrawn the comment immediately\" once he realised the journalist was Jewish, said Mr Blair. \"I'm sure that is what in truth he wants to do. Well, he should do it.\" Mr Livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made, and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper. He conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.",
    "Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venice's famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.\nViotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milan's La Scala and the Vienna State Opera. His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet's Manon last week.\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti's last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Vienna State Opera.",
    "Legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the man credited with developing \"total football\", has died aged 77.\nReferred to in the Netherlands as \"the General\", Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Cup - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Germany. However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final. Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971. His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world. The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football. Michels had recently undergone heart surgery and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: \"He was one of the best coaches we had in history.\" The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, named coach of the century by world football's governing body Fifa in 1999, also won five caps for the Netherlands as a bruising centre forward. Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp said: \"He was the man who, together with Cruyff, made Dutch football big.\"",
    "The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.\nStaff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered. US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.\nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand \"what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath\".\nAdding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate \"sickout\". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.\nUS Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.\n\"US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,\" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was \"embarrassed by the situation\" and \"deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,\" The probe will focus on the industry's compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair \"deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline's crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,\" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.",
    "Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else's agenda.\" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can't change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves.\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn't going to be there in New York, that's been taken out of the equation.\" \nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.\"",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.\nRates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August. Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.\nRising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.\n\"Today's no change decision is correct,\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"\nMr Frost added: \"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"\nOn Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\n\"So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.",
    "Germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.\nGross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. It is the nineteenth month in a row that the ECB has not moved borrowing costs. Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.\n\"During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,\" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt. \"If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.\" Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. They have also warned there are more cost cutting measures on the horizon.",
    "Tony Blair has launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a \"ludicrous improbability\".\nThe prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure. Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut £35bn in \"wasteful\" spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts. On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing \"inefficiencies\" which had \"burgeoned\" under Labour. In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.\n\"I believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government.\" Mr Blair added: \"They, the Conservatives have learned nothing.\" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed.\nMr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. \"So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight.\" In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education. \"Everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,\" he said. Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for \"huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy\". \"The public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a Tory government,\" he concluded.\nGordon Brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny. Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be \"distracted or diverted\". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: \"We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.\"\nMr Brown warned that the Tories were planning \"the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto\". Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of \"misrepresenting\" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans. \"He still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools, hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,\" Mr Letwin said. \"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans?\"",
    "British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.\nThe Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. Another 7% said they would not vote at all. The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006. The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.\nBallot papers in the poll will ask: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?\" The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.\nThe treaty was signed by all 25 current EU members in Rome last October and is due to come into force in November 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote. Meanwhile, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\".",
    "Ray Charles, who has won a string of posthumous Grammy Awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.\nHis sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent UK beat and R&B scenes.\nCompared in stature to Elvis Presley by some commentators, Charles' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison. His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the \"devil's\" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.\nWithout Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett. He was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock 'n' roll greats, including I've Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What'd I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael's sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack.\nHe also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of Hank Williams standards such as Your Cheating Heart and You Win Again. More than 40 years after its release, his 1962 ABC album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is still regarded as a classic. His version of Don Gibson's I Can't Stop Loving You topped the pop and R&B charts in the US. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People.\nOn it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a \"brother in every sense of the word\". \"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did,\" he said. Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes. \"I'm quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,\" he told BBC News Online. \"I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever.\"",

Warriors' goalkeeper Murambadoro, who made a name for himself at the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia, helped Bnei Sakhnin overcome Albania's Partizani Tirana 6-1 in the previous round. Murambadoro moved to Israel recently after a brief stint with South African club Hellenic. The club won the Israeli Cup final last season and are based in Sakhnin, which is near Haifa.

    "The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.\nShe told the Guardian newspaper there would be no \"Las Vegas-style\" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes \"a pile of pants\". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. \"You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots,\" Mr Pound told the Today programme. \"I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,\" he said.\nMs Jowell complained of the \"scale of misrepresentation\" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to \"protect children and the vulnerable\" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: \"We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing.\" And continued: \"We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way.\" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.",
    "The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor.\nNew owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers. It also plans to develop a \"worldwide entertainment concept\" with the brand, although details are not yet known. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.\nIn the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.\nThe Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.\nTulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run. The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m.",
    "The 2005 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is a geek's paradise with more than 50,000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event.\nTop gadgets at the show are highlighted in the Innovations Showcase, which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. The BBC News website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005. \n \nOne of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files. The 2.5GB and 5GB circular pocket hard drive from Seagate might help. The external USB drive won a CES best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket. \"It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool,\" said Seagate. \"It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality.\" \"It is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy,\" it said. In the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures. \n \nUniversal Electronics' NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house. It can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. Working with home broadband networks and PCs, the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful, simple interface. Paul Arling, UEI chief, said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. He said the Nevo gave people a simple, single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. The Nevo won two awards at CES, one as a Girl's Best Friend award and another for innovation, design and engineering. The gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (£425). \n \nHotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its Solo Chassis gaming chair. The specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own \"space\". It is compatible with all the major games consoles, DVD players and PCs. \"We found that kids love playing in surround sound,\" said Jay LeBoff from Hotseat. \"We are looking at offering different types of seats, depending on the market success of this one.\" The chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos, with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. And a drinks holder. The chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in April and is expected to cost $399 (£211). \n \nSatellite radio is big business in the US. In the UK, the digital radio technology is known as DAB and works on slightly different technology. Eton Corporation's Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US. DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. \"It is for the risqu&#233; consumer,\" said an Eton spokesperson. \"We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.\" The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. In the US is it expected to cost $250 (£133). \n \nThe average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES. This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years' time. One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo's tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months. A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. \n \nWearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. MPIO's tiny digital USB music players come in an array of fashionable colours, taking a leaf out of the Apple iPod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. Slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. Although the pendant design was launched three months ago, the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends. An even dinkier model, the FY500, comes out in May and will store about 256MB of music. The range of players recently won an International Forum design award 2005.",
    "The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\nJob creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.",
    "The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).\nThe Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal. Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.\nThe Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk.\nBut critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. According to Menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. \"We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,\" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. \"The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today.\"\nMenatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to \"virtually nothing\" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%. According to its Paris lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case. But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. \"Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,\" he said.\nYukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep. He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.",
    "Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nThe fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox.\nThe thrust of this year's show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. \"The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,\" Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website. \"It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.\"\nConsumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. \"This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. \"Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,\" said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the \"democratisation\" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple's iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.\nThe CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft's Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January.",
    "Web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.\nThese online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. The most well-known examples include Iraqi Salam Pax's accounts of the US-led war, former Iranian vice-president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign. There are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last November.\nThe blogging movement has been building up for many years.\nAndrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. \"You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before,\" he says. \"And blogs were a key part of that transformation.\" Among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying \"we are sorry\" for George W Bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio. \"We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas,\" he told the BBC News website. \"But they followed the story, they didn't lead it.\"\nSome parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.\nOthers, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content. \"I don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. It is in transition, as society itself is in transition,\" says Mr Nachison. However, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. \"The one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, it is threatened. And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse,\" says Mr Nachison. \"The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't, that's gone forever.\" \"With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.\"\nIt seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.\nBut the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. Tools such as Google's Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog. US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. But experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay. \"We are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other,\" said Mr Nachison. \"And there's going to be bad that comes with the good.\"",
    "China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.\nThe move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. \"Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,\" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website.\nSome of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.\nThe Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.",
    "European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro.\nThe European single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months. Tacit approval from the White House for the weaker greenback, which could help counteract huge deficits, has helped trigger the move. But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden.\nChina is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar. \"Asia should engage in greater currency flexibility,\" said French finance minister Herve Gaymard, after a meeting with his German counterpart Hans Eichel. Markets responded by pushing the euro lower, in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the G7 industrialised countries next week. Early on Tuesday morning, the dollar had edged higher to 1.3040 euros. The yen, meanwhile, had strengthened to 102.975 against the dollar by 0730 GMT.",
    "Most areas of the US saw their economy continue to expand in December and early January, the US Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book report.\nOf the 12 US regions it identifies for the study, 11 showed stronger economic growth, with only the Cleveland area falling behind with a \"mixed\" rating. Consumer spending was higher in December than November, and festive sales were also up on 2003. The employment picture also improved, the Fed said.\n\"Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest,\" the Beige Book said. \"Several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.\" The report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. \"Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington DC, and New York City, two of the nation's strongest commercial markets,\" the Fed said.",
    "Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.\nMr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair. A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.\nThe event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, Mr Brown replied: \"You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy.\"\nHe refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. Mr Brown later told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\" Downing Street cited that comment when reporters' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe\". Labour's new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign \"which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country\".\nConservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: \"The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H.\" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.\nThe prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a \"scorching\" from MPs.\nOn Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: \"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.\" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked.",
    "Spectators were evacuated from Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and Real Sociedad.\nMore than 70,000 people abandoned the ground with the score at 1-1 and only three minutes left to play. The Basque newspaper Gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. But after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs, the police said that no explosive device had been found.\n\"The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything,\" said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. \"The best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us.\" Madrid midfielder Guti told private Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: \"I have never seen this before and sport should be above it all.\" Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. It is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand.\nIf the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. Initial reports suggested the Basque separatist group ETA may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. The Bernabeu was targeted by ETA on 1 May, 2002, when Madrid were about to play FC Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. A car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club.\nAnelka was quoted in a French newspaper as saying he would like to play in the Champions League for a bigger club. But chairman John Wardle said: \"I've spoken to Nicolas and he's apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the French press. \"We are a big club. Nicolas told me that he agrees with me that we are a big club.\" Wardle was speaking at the club's annual general meeting, where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker. The club still owe French club PSG £5m from the purchase of Anelka in May 2002. He has been linked with a move to Barcelona and Liverpool, and Reds skipper Steven Gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at Anfield. But Wardle added: \"There's been no bids for Nicolas Anelka. No-one has come to me and said I would like to buy Nicolas Anelka.\n\"If a bid comes in for Nicolas Anelka I will speak to the board and then speak to Kevin Keegan. \"If there was a bid and it was a bid of substance and worth taking then between us we'd decide. \"We still owe some money on Nicolas which we have clear out, so it would have to be above that.\" Wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips. He added: \"I've no intention of selling Shaun Wright-Phillips. \"If someone comes with a silly bid I'll have to discuss it. \"But we're not putting him on the shelf to sell. He is the heart and soul of this club and has his heart and sole in this club, and he would be very upset if I put him in the shop window. \"He was an academy kid here, he's just signed a new four-year deal, I don't think he'd do that unless he wanted to play for Manchester City Football Club.\" City recently announced debts of £62m, but Wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the January transfer window. He said: \"Like Kevin I'd like to see some players come in. We've got to see what we can do - whether it's a on a Bosman or not. \"We will try to be creative to generate some funds. But maybe we have to start looking at clubs like Everton and Bolton to see how they have been dealing in the transfer market and do a similar type of thing.\"",
    "The Conservatives would stand up for the \"forgotten majority\", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.\nThe Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values. In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. Labour says the document offers only a return to a \"failed Tory past\". The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.\nCampaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster. Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto. Other chapters will follow in coming weeks.\nIn a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the \"forgotten majority\" made up the backbone of Britain. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. He says in the manifesto foreword: \"They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair.\"\nSaying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue \"down the path of ever rising taxes\". He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall \"bureaucrats\". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. \"The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,\" he says.\nMr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. Mr Howard told BBC News: \"I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep.\" The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. It had nothing to do with putting \"clear blue water\" between himself and his opponents.\nLabour's election slogan will be: \"Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again\". Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of \"launching Thatcherism in instalments\" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September. \"The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust,\" he said.",

Radcliffe's career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the \"Big City\" marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. \"Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,\" said Radcliffe. \"I don't pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. \"I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. \"It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.\"",

    "Film-maker Spike Lee says black representation is stronger than ever in cinema and TV but the true power in entertainment lies behind the camera.\nThe She Hate Me director urged students at his old Atlanta university, Morehouse College, to seek \"gatekeeper positions\" behind the scenes. Lee told them to \"work up the corporate ladder because everybody can't be an actor, everybody can't make a record\". He spoke as part of a discussion panel, then led a retrospective of his films.\nReturning to his old university, which educates only African American students, Lee discussed the challenges facing black people in the entertainment industry. \"Even Denzel (Washington), he's getting $20m a movie. But when it comes time to do a movie, he has to go to one of those gatekeepers,\" Lee said. He told aspiring young film-makers in the audience not to ignore non-traditional routes to getting a movie made, including raising funds independently and releasing films straight to DVD. \"It's a huge market,\" the 47-year-old director said. \"It's not something that should be looked upon as a stepchild.\" Lee has made more than 25 films, including Jungle Fever, Do the Right Thing, Summer of Sam and 1986 hit She's Gotta Have It.",
    "Your computer can now help solve the world's most difficult health and social problems.\nLaunched this week, the World Community Grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems. The donated processor cycles will help the WCG create virtual supercomputers via the net. The idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop PCs. One of the most successful collaboration projects was Seti@home, run by the Search for Extra Terrestrial Life project, which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication.\nAnyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the WGC website. Once installed, the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process, and reports back after completing that task. The first WCG problem being tackled will be the Human Proteome Folding Project, which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold.\nThe subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences, and technology. The body will evaluate proposals from leading research, public and not-for-profit organizations, and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year. Organisations also represented on the board include the United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organisation.\n\"The World Community Grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues,\" said Elain Gallin, program director for medical research at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. \"[It] will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems\", she added. IBM has donated the hardware, software, technical services and expertise to build the basic infrastructure for the grid.

    "Cult British group Portishead have revealed they are writing their third album, their first in eight years.\nFounding member Geoff Barrow told BBC 6 Music the record was well on the way to being completed. \"We're actually into it as we speak. We took some time off for Christmas, but generally we're doing another record,\" Barrow told the digital radio station. News of their album plans comes after confirmation the Bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam's Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.\n\"We've just had our heads down really, we've never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. \"So for us it just seems, even though we haven't played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven't released a record for a long time.\" Portishead will not play any new material at next month's concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Other acts appearing include Liverpool band The Coral and former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Dummy was a critics' favourite in 1994, hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.",
    "Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.\nNew figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor's 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.\nThe economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.\nMr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. \"The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,\" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. \"But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.\"\nConsumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. \"The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,\" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was \"much less alarming\" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which \"are no indication of broad PPI pressure\", were responsible for the increase, he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said \"it is a good bet these increases won't stick\".",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "I'm seriously really upset at second boss vault of stars. For a pure melee rogue it's next to impossible to help with the ice. Since we're pretty squishy as it is if you're standing on ice for more then. 5 seconds you're dead. That's insane but I can dodge and shit so whatever. But the aoe the boss does for ice just randomly hits after putting a red circle around u. Like it's really hard to dodge as I haven't found its timed at all.. Again I can get past that. What I can't get past is the god damn icicles. It's literally impossible as a melee character to help get your team broken out. The ice surrounding it hits insanely hard which is fucked. So I can't be near it. If I so happen to hit one good encounter and break them out it explodes and kills me. So which leaves me with one option tunnel vision. Which does the job  UT only once every 60 seconds. Ice happens every 20 so wtf am I to do. Help if there is a way",
    "I'm not sure if this has been discussed before, but I wanted to bring it up because it's been a while, and it doesn't seem like this issue has been fixed... Every time and I mean, every single time I paricipate, regardless if I finish 1st or 5th, the game takes me to last place. The  moment i reach the finish line it starts loading and keeps loading until everyone has run \"passed\" me and obviously loaded the finish faster than me.... Is this a thing that's meant to be happening? Recently I actually managed to fishish first for the first time and that was only because everyone else had somehow lagged so much behind me that it managed to load before they finished, which is even more purplexing because it means it's not a techical issue that happens all the time. It seems to be more like a bad design choice.... It's extremily frustrating especially since the run itself is also prety frustrating... Is this an issue worth reporting? Is it my wifi??, I mean it's not good, but that's just unfair... I heard someone else here was having the same issue... Is this how the runs go, do you have to finish like a good minute before everyone else to get first place???",
    "As the title says, I got this extreme feeling of wanting to drink women's milk from her tits. I don't know if there is a link for that, but I always want to do it. Even if she's not pregnant. I want to like keeping sucking till some comes out. Maybe, when I have a wife, I'll be sucking on her tits while she's pregnant with our own baby😂. But, right now, I want to just suck on some female's tit for some milk. Maybe, it's because I wasn't able to do it as a child since I was allergic to a lot of things as a baby, so I couldn't. But, now, I'm fine. I don't care if the woman's tits are small or big. I just want to suck them for the milk🤤😂😂. Like a milk vampire🤣. I'll probably get off just by sucking them dry🤤",
    "Not exactly sure where to post this but I thought this was a good one. I recently moved in with my good friend from high school after graduating college in May. Things are good between us, I have known him since middle school and we get along great. The rough thing is I am and have always been jealous of him. He's a tall attractive blonde guy with natural good looks and I am let's say not that. I have come to terms with not being super attractive a long time ago but it is tough to hear him talk about all the girls he rejects or gets with. He just seems happier than I am with his life, I work IT and make a sizeable salary while he works part time with no degree and takes a nap for most of the day. He just seems better than me at all of our shared hobbies. I don't want these feelings to ruin our friendship because he is a good friend but I find myself getting more annoyed at it after moving in. Any advice?",
    "I finally got around to giving my retriever a bath today after a month. He's been itchy these past few days and I figured a bath would help him. He's prone to itchy skin from time to time due to food allergies to environmental allergies. I used a medicated anti-itch shampoo. Just now my brother started grilling me about what I used to bathe him with to what I used to dry him with after, because he was scratching a lot. I agree, he is still scratching, but no more than he was these past few days. I felt slighted cuz I feel like he's indirectly blaming me for making the dog itchy. And today's my birthday and I chose to spend a quiet day at home relaxing and giving my dogs a bath and my day just got ruined by that. He couldn't keep his mouth shut and blame me tomorrow instead...I'm sorry if I sound petty. I just feel sad suddenly..I wanted a day where I could mentally escape and just let my stress go and he completely ruined it and made me feel bad..",
    "I had zero anxiety about getting this shot, I’m a perfectly healthy 26 year old male. However, I had a terrible experience getting the first vaccine. Two minutes after injection, my ears start ringing and I become lightheaded. Next, my vision starts to blacken and become distorted. This intensified for several minutes and I was sweating an insane amount. At this point I’m freaking tf out because I can’t see nor can I hear and I know I’m like the only person having this experience. I did not flag anyone down I just waited in panic hoping my senses would return. After what seemed like a lifetime, but was only 3 minutes, my vision started to return and I suddenly got freezing although I continued to sweat. I left feeling like I just had intercourse against my will, and I also did not tell anyone at the site. I now feel very reluctant to get the 2nd Pfizer dose and am overall just still shocked I had such a terrible experience. Has anyone experienced something similar? Should I have told someone?",
    "I've only dated one person and I loved her with my whole being and she said the same to me but then she cheated on me and whenever we fought she made me feel like it was my fault. We tried to make it work but she kept talking to him behind my back and then she started to distance herself from me broke up with me and immediately fucked around with him saying that she didn't love me anymore when a week before she was saying how much I meant to her. Couple months later they stopped being together and we got together again after talking for a while and she said she started to like me again but then suddenly completely stopped talking to me saying she realised she didn't miss me that much and then blocked me everywhere and seems to be with him again. I don't know what I feel, I feel used, unlovable and worthless. I get massive panic and anxiety remembering everything and I've tried to kill myself three times and two times had to be taken to the hospital. She's the only person that's actually made me feel loved. It's like I have no value or reason to be respected.",
    "I’ll try to be as brief as possible: I was diagnosed with depression around five years ago, when I was only 17, after I tried to commit suicide. As a consequence, I started seeing a therapist while also taking medications. And I actually saw some improvements. However, Everything went downhill Two years ago, when my mother passed away. She was the person I loved the most in the world, and the only one who never made me feel guilty about my problems, so because I am dumb as fuck I just disappeared, never contacted my therapists again, stopped my medications, and moved to London while also taking drugs and leading a very wild life until I almost killed myself. I have now come home for nearly one year, and I made the hard decision of starting therapy again. Last week I went to see a psychiatrist that a friend of mine suggested me to see. After he asked me a few questions whose answers I am not sure he understood since he kept interrupting me, he told me, “Listen to me, kid, you are not sick, or depressed, look at yourself, you are all pretty and dolled up, you are probably just sad because your mum died, you simply need to toughen up and get over it, and you’ll be fine” I Was shocked. I left his office crying, and now I am totally at a loss. Should I give up on therapy? Should I see thiS guy again and give him a second chance? I don’t know what to do.. maybe I am just destined to be miserable.",
    "I am 16 and own a 66/80cc 2 cycle motorized bicycle I recently came across an issue with my carburetor leaking fuel due to the float needle not stopping the flow of gas coming from my tank, therefore, causing the carb to overflow. I did not know how to fix this issue so I installed a flow valve on my fuel line with the flow valve installed I can turn on and off the gas flow to the carb. To fix my issue I turn on the fuel valve thus allowing gas to flow into my carb and once the carb starts to leak I turn it off, now that I have my carb filled with gas I can ride my bike for about 2 to 3 miles before running out of gas in my carb I then fill it back up by turning on my fuel valve. I know this is not the best solution and am probably decreasing my engine's life span but it is all that I came up with. I then thought why not get rid of my gas tank altogether and just oversize my carb's float bowl. Please let me know what you guys think of this idea and if I should patent it or not.",
    "Just something that came to me recently while thinking of the past games I've played. My first console game was My Street for the PS2, which was a fun minigame fest with games like RC Kart, Dodgeball, and Volleyball. I spent so many hours playing My Street with my brothers and even just by myself against the CPUs. And looking at the games I like now, I can say My Street has definitely influenced my preferences. I love games like Mario Party and Mario Kart, and the LittleBigPlanet series was one of my favorites to play and explore all the custom worlds other players made. So I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences with their first video game and their video game preferences.",
    "I started self harm from 6th grade. It got to a point where even if a tiny problem would arise in my life, I would turn towards my razor. It was my guilty pleasure and it turned into an addiction. I couldn't function at that point without this. Fast forward a few years later, and I'm trying to give up my addiction. It isnt easy and 4 to 5 months pass and I get stressed to a point that I cannot handle it and I relapse. I've been thinking that whenever this happens, I look towards my razor, but should I instead go for Vaping? I know my parents will never allow it because I live in a society where mental health is disregarded and mental disorders are not real. But still, if I were to ever get my hands on a vape, should I? I get stressed like that once every 4 5 months so I will not be smoking constantly. However I will still have an exit ready for me. Is it worth it?",

Having  a good enough body but just a smaller chest with inverted nipples , he made me feel little about my 2 insecurities and never enough . I still held on until now but I’ve begun to question is it worth it ? Will someone love me better ?

    "Sooo you know how every character has 3 lives in the Dream Smp? How did they get those 3 lives in the first place? What if the second and third lives are just copies of the FIRST life. You may say this makes no sense but how do you just die and come back all fine with all your memories? Also there is a book called the revive book on the server which only dream possesses and has been used TWICE. Once on Tommy and once on Henry his pet cow. Which shows that the revive book can be used multiple times and the person you used it on gains all their memories after revival. So what if you can revive the \"copies\" or your \"lives\" that you have lost through the revive book basically creating infinite copies of you with all your memories. I mean they have to go some where right? The dead have to go somewhere RIGHT? Comment on this post if you think this theory is viable or its just bs. Also I have another question that is how or who created/found the revive book and gave it to Jschlatt who then gave it to Dream?",

While we were FaceTiming each other, one of her guy friends asked to call her and she asked me if it was ok for her to answer.

    "So I've recently finished The Betrayal of Jimmy and played halfway through Jimmy's Vendetta. The missions are actually awful and some are even ripoffs of the main storyline, the Chinese restaurant shooting for example. Also what does it mean that they are in an alternate timeline? Why does the Mafia universe have different timelines? There also isn't any real lore, which was the strength of the main campaign. Instead we got a few scenes and a character we know very little about and isn't even connected to anything in the main story. The only positive thing to say is that you can explore the open world after the campaign is finished, which is one of my few points of criticism in the main storyline. How can those DLCs be so bad and boring. Should I even try to continue or should I cancel playing them? Also what about Joe's Adventures? Is it also worth playing, or is it as bad as the Jimmy DLCs?",

It's stupid but I thought of using text to speech and just having a static image of my face, but i can't even do that cause the text to speech for my language is horrible.

I really like the owner and wouldn't want to screw him over when the time does come to leave. When accepting a new position, how do you go about the whole two week notice thing? Are employers actually cool with saying,\" Oh I can start in two weeks.\"? It feels to me like an employer might be upset or go with someone else if you can't start soon/immediately, but that may not really be the case in the professional world.

    "Title pretty much explains it all, my cat hates his wet food. I know wet food is much better for cats than the dry stuff, but my little guys just won’t eat it 95% of the time, I put it out and he turns his head an walks away. I’ve tried many many different types of food, and he doesn’t like any of it. He absolutely loves the dry stuff though, sits there and meows and begs for it constantly. After a while of him not eating the wet stuff I usually end up caving and giving him the dry stuff cause, obviously, I don’t want him to starve. I know cats are supposed to eat the wet stuff, that’s where they get most of their fluids from and it’s just better in general, so I’d like to get him to eat it, but he just outright refuses most of the time. On the rare occasion he does eat it, he’ll just eat like half and then leave the rest. What the heck can I do? Should I just give up on the wet stuff and only give him dry? He does have a fancy little water fountain that I see him drinking out of, so I know he isn’t dehydrated, but the lack of eating good food is a bit concerning. He’s about 5 years old, and has kind of always been this way, but recently has gotten worse. I even bought him some special bowls because I was worried it might be whisker fatigue, but that hasn’t helped either. If anybody had any advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",

All I could think of was you. I wish I could take you out for eel sushi, and I’d get your favorite beer, and your favorite bread. It would be so worth it to know you’re eating properly and see the huge smile you get on your face whenever you have your favorite food. We could do something really special together. Now thinking of that money opens up a pit in my stomach I’ve tried to think of something else to use it on but it all pales compared to you.

I hope no one said anything rude. I pray for your safety every day. I can never stop loving you, and I don’t think I’ll ever climb out of this dark pit.

    "So I’ve been learning the basics of forex and when to take trades through IM academy. Basically I know more or less when to take a trade through hourglass using the Cashtrap strategy. It shows you possible trades you could take. The educator says that just using indicators on hourglass you could win 60-70% of your trades. I’ve learned the point system they use to have more confirmations to know whether or not a trade is good to take or not. The problem I’m having is that the educators seem to kinda of repeat themselves over and over and I don’t think I’m learning anything more than what they are saying. They are trying to pass it off as something so simple when in actuality it’s not. I follow the strategy exactly how it was taught but I still seem to lose. I paid a lot of money to learn this and it’s starting to feel like a scam almost. I understand that the market does it’s own thing and you can’t predict right every trade but following everything I’ve been taught I still can’t seem to predict right. I have good and bad days but it’s confusing to know where I should be placing trades and I feel helpless because the educators are on repeat mode every time they go live.",

    "Now I know Victreebel can get swords dance and everything good mainly in postgame of fire red making the only real moveset I want to go with for him is razor leaf, body slam, toxic or acid, and maybe double team or rest. Victreebel isn’t the best in the older gens or maybe he is I have no idea. But I’d love to know what you think maybe I can give him other moves I’m deciding on either him or exeggutor and I really don’t know what else to use the rest of my team is gonna be Charizard, Primeape, Lapras, Raichu, and Nidoking and Victreebel is getting the 6th spot if I can find him viable, this is for ingame only also and I have access to get a bellsprout cause my brother has leaf green, I’d love to hear what you guys think and thanks.",
    "my best friend would always comment on my moms ass, tits, etc. he would always say how he fucks her yk the usual shit. until i came home early from playing basketball and i see my best friends car in the driveway. i go inside and it’s quiet but my moms home bc of covid. i go into her room to ask why he’s here to see my childhood best friend fucking my mom. she hurried for her clothes and that’s when i saw his dick. it had to have been at least 9 inches while i’m only 3 inches. while my moms rushing for clothes he tells her to stop and that he wants to see what’s in my pants. my mom didn’t say anything and neither did i do he came over and choked me against the wall and dropped my pants. he made my own mom take a picture or our dicks next to each other and then told me he wants to keep fuckign my mom. obviously i said no and we were going back and forth until he just holds me down and ties me up with bedsheets. he forced me to watch him fuck my own mom. she loves every part of it and was so surprised to see how much bigger his dick was",
    "I just watched fragment of trash taste how they lambasted Kazuya for that thing with not running after Mizuhara and i m wondering... I know when i started reading i felt he was pain in the ass but kinda understand where all those things he did come from and just gave him some pass. His pervert side is still annoying but i feel like it is author trying to be  funny but failing mostly. Otherwise he is really great later on even this situation when he said sorry to Mizuhara for not running after her made me sad for the guy and later on there where more moments where i really felt some emotions after him trying to open himself or trying to be brave. Is it really that bad in anime or am i just incel feeling bad for other incel ? I felt really down in my life for quite some time so i relate to characters with low self esteem especially this low like Kazuya, because it's uplifting when he tries to fight for himself out there.",
    "Ages ago it has its battery changed; after it wouldn’t turn on with the battery plugged in nor would the battery take any charge. It has done little other than sit since unused since then. Recently I decided I’d try using it so I readied a bootable El Capitan usb as it’s hard drive is completely blank, but the MacBook wouldn’t turn on. I eventually found out that holding down the power button for 10 seconds and then plugging it in continuing to hold down the power button for another 10 seconds. When it does turn on the fans are full blast and whether it’s to El Capitan install, High Sierra install, internet recovery, or the hard drive from a know working MacBook it will only make it a little past halfway before shutting off and coming back on again only to repeat. If it is turned off anyway other than when it shuts itself off the 20 second power button thing has to be done again. I’ve tried an nvram/pram reset and the option+command+shift+power to no avail. On the inside there’s no evidence of water damage. I’ve been trying at it for two days now and I’m out of ideas as to what the problem could be.",
    "I feel so incredibly anxious. I can’t sit still. After a rollercoaster emotionally abusive relationship that lasted two years and after 1 year sharing an apartment together, I moved across the country for a while. After a month of not seeing him, I’m back. I’m seeing him tonight. The level of anxiety I feel is unreal. I can’t sit still for more than a few moments without feeling nauseated with unease. We wanted to meet up to get closure for everything that happened, but it was a toxic relationship. He begged for me back a week ago and has been standoffish the last few days. He told me he’s incredibly depressed and wants to want to seek help, but it seems that he won’t. He’s erratic in his communication and seemingly his feelings toward me. He says he feels like it’s going to be weird to see each other and I feel the same, to an extent. Despite everything he’s done and everything that’s happened, I miss him and am excited to see him. I don’t know whether or not that’s wrong.. people who are close to me tell me that I shouldn’t see him at all. I can’t help but feel drawn to him, even if it’s for the last time. Advice on how to handle this situation?",
    "Started a new job, its kinda scary not physically knowing who your teammates are. I mean chat chat pero iba pa din like 1st day at sabay-sabay kayo kakain, tatawa kayo pag lahat kayo nahihirapan, etc. It kinda feels like on your own dba. Parang zoom meetings feel awkward din, saglint lng and like its kinda different din like having the vibe of someone working beside you and making chikka. Its awkward just inviting people na \"hey magzoom tayo para lng may presensya\" and it doesnt feel the same. Anyone who can give advice on how to handle this scenario? I guess its the feeling of uneasiness din sa new role, new company and before pandemic, hadn't realize the value of having people starting with you.",
    "Their motivation is pretty weak to be honest and Marvel's attempt to connect their motivation with \"The Blip\" makes absolutely zero sense either.  Like what motivated them to do what they do in the show? We got a glimpse of it like wanting the life before the blip to come back and \"blip refugees\". Why are the blip refugees struggling exactly? Why the life after the blip sucks even more? I'm not saying that every single question have to be answered ,but the way they try to make the audience sympathize with the Flagsmashers just doesn't work. Maybe they could have showed us a small glimp of the struggles people faced after the blip and the struggles the blip refugees are going through ,but none of it was hinted properly at all. It was just \"bad\" things that's happening and we're supposed to relate with that suddenly.",
    "I am like 90% sure Isayama was made to make the ending more digestable. Why, you ask? All we have to do is look at the Season 2 ED. EVERYTHING is a reference there, EVEN THE FUCKING BABY is in there. Do you know what was in there that we've never seen? The mass of people wandering away. Those surely had to be the collossals turning back. This in itself is not the reason why many people dislike the ending, but I can surely say that some things were fucked with, and I doubt that that was the only one. I can even imagine some executive telling him literally after 138 that \"yeah man your shits fucked up no way we can have those characters die. figure it out\" Jean and Connie were brought back without even them getting brought back. They just kind of.. appeared? I don't know, maybe it's just my last dose of copium, but I am convinced that this was not that was envisioned.",
    "I am about a month into this hobby. I got myself a giant trance x. I walk with a cane do to a hip injury I received from a motorcycle accident when I was younger. Over the last year I have lost 168 lbs and wanted to strengthen my leg muscles before my hip replacement surgery. I told my doc I want you to have to work to get to my hip after I put on all this muscles lol. My legs were so weak. I started riding a beach cruiser about 8 months ago and was able to build up to a 20 mile ride, but I was limited on where I could go because of not having gears. Now I have open up so many doors with this bike. Me and my brother did our first climb two days ago. Holy crap that was one hell of a workout. It is a 14 mile ride with elevation gains of 2200 feet. We were only able to do like four miles with a gain of like 500 feet. The ride down just from that far up the hill got me hooked. This hill now has become my unfinished quest and i will beat it. It feels so good to have purpose again in my life and to seek out these challenges that are hard instead of running away from the hard things like I use to do.",
    "Title basically. I have an iPod Mini I recently upgraded, swapping out the 4 gig hard drive for a much larger compactflash card and it's eventual home will be a little cabin I'm building on a plot of land out in the middle of nowhere. It's being stuffed full of audiobooks and radio plays, including from my sizable Audible collection. At the moment I'm downloading my books, converting to MP3, splitting into chapters and then putting on the mini. This is mostly automated for me with the toolchain I've put together with shell scripts, but still takes a pretty long time. The mini is compatible with Audible formats 2, 3 and 4 which would greatly simplify things into drag and drop but for the life of me I can't get audible's servers to spit out the old formats. Is it impossible or is there a trick I'm missing?",
    "Just got home from a visit with my GI doc. Wasn’t even a visit, it was more of a lecture. He canceled my GES. I’ve been waiting for it for so long. He says that he found that I am lactose intolerant and that must be what is causing my symptoms. I was on a lactose free diet and I saw no fucking difference. Lactose intolerance isn’t nausea every single moment of your life. Lactose intolerance isn’t eating and vomiting the undigested food a couple hours later. He didn’t even give a shit about how much weight I’ve lost. I was so fucking overweight before my symptoms and now I can barely get it above 105 lbs. I’m not fucking crazy. I went to that appointment so bloated that I looked pregnant. Nobody listens. My mom doesn’t care. My dads a doctor and even HE won’t listen to me. He says he doesn’t want me on gut stimulators because I’m under 18 and they cause abdominal pain. Abdominal pain? That’s my middle name at this point. My mom is calling my primary doctor now to adjust my anxiety meds because I broke down when we left that appointment. Wanna know why I’m anxious and depressed? BECAUSE OF THIS FUCKING HEALTH CONDITION. GOD DAMN IT. What the hell do I do? Do I need to say my symptoms in French since nobody seems to understand them in English? Why won’t anyone listen to me?😭",
    "I know that I am overly quiet in social situations, and that it’s because a lot of the time I overthink anything I might say. Most of the time it keeps me from saying anything at all. I feel like it makes people think I’m stuck up or unapproachable. People tend to fill in the blanks if you know what I mean. A lot of people will say I should try not to think so much and just say the first thing that comes to mind, but the thing is on those rare occasions where I don’t overthink too much and start to get comfortable so I actually talk to people I feel like a lot of the time I’m awkward, and in ways I can’t always quite put my finger on either. Like I put my foot in my mouth or overshare or just say odd things that people don’t know how to respond to. It all makes me cringe and go back into that overthinking mode and I feel socially inept. It makes me want to cry and be a hermit. I don’t know what I’m looking for here, maybe I just need to vent. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "So this post is going to be somewhat of a jumbled mess as I dictated in my car as I’m driving from my iPhone but I just had a thought after reading some news about student loan forgiveness and with all the money that’s been spent through the government I think there’s an agenda in motion to cancel Fiat currency and the future is going to be only a Cryptocurrency somewhat like China just did. the United States will probably create its own so I don’t know where that leaves all the currencies that we have now but I think it’s important that we invest as much as we can into these currency’s now. I can see the US dollar becoming worthless and these things come quicker than we realize it could happen within a year could happen within 10 years we don’t know my advice to everybody is put everything that you feel comfortable putting in the crypto currencies as you can. And thank you for reading this if you did. And please comment your thoughts",
    "Honestly, the storyline I'm most worried about in the show is the shipwreck storyline with Matthias and Nina. All the other storylines in the show, including the crows, tie in to Alina's story, and are all connected. But I feel like, especially for new viewers, the Helnik storyline is just gonna feel like a random shipwreck in a random part of the world with two random characters who we don't really care about and have nothing to do with the main storyline with Alina. I just feel like it will feel a bit random and disconnected to the rest of the plot, especially considering all the other plots are connected. Maybe they have come up with a sensible way to believably tie them together, but even then it doesn't really look like nina and matthias is gonna interact with or even meet any of the other characters, unless it's just one scene at the beginning or the ending. I think I am most worried about the fact that new viewers are gonna be confused and not really care about the storyline at all.",

Because of this I have found cooking and cleaning very difficult, almost impossible.  This had lead to me needing to order out almost every meal. Funds are dwindling and I'm getting extremely overwhelmed. I've been finding it very difficult to even keep trying. I've been in too much pain to effectively  take care of myself.

I feel like I can't even talk to my partner because they keep recommending therapy and while I know they aren't my therapist sometimes I just need to talk to someone. I moved to a new state in order to be with my partner a few years ago and have struggled hard with making new friends, got a better paying but less satisfying job, we're even expecting our first kid soon.

    "I don't want to be like this - I'm too old for this shit. I don't want to spend the rest of my life posting about my heartaches. I don't romanticize heartbreaks. I dont intentionally torture myself with thoughts of you, they just come to me - like a thief in the night, leaving me robbed and helpless. There's nothing sweet about this and I'm far too logical for this. I don't enjoy wracking my brain, trying to find words that would best describe how I feel - and every time failing because no words could really come close to how gut wrenching, soul destroying this is. I put into words how I feel because supposedly it helps - I haven't seen any result yet at all. There's only one thing that would help me - and that only comprises of three letters - YOU. I'm so fed up with myself. I have no fucking illusions, no grandiose dreams of getting back together, of a happily ever after. I've lived in the fairy tale we have created long enough - and I'm living now my reality. I'm tired to my bones of feeling this way...I just want to move on. I'm not harboring any negative thoughts about you or about myself - no blaming, it is what it is. Some relationships are not meant to last, and some people are not meant to be together. That is life and I'm well too aware of it. But fuuuuuck, the pain. I just want it to stop. Now. Not when I'm six feet under the ground and I wouldn't give a fuck at all. I don't want to continue going through this anymore. I have accepted that we are not meant to be. I'm not angry about that. Just please, let me be free of this pain. Cause I just can't anymore.",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country. Personally, I think the trans-atlantic alliance must end and we should go back into isolationism.",

    "When my son was seven I took him to Dover Castle.  Neither he or I were aware of specific hauntings at the castle prior to the visit.  After a great day we returned home.  On tucking my son up in bed that night we chatted about the day and he asked me about a woman he’d seen dressed in a long red dress.  I thought it odd, although he was clearly not scared but more intrigued by her enough to ask me who she was.    I had not seen anyone matching the description although had been with my son throughout the day.   I thought nothing about it until a day or two later when, out of general curiosity I googled the castle and discovered that it is famous for being haunted with several ghosts one of which was a lady in a long red dress exactly where my son had seen her.",

I just tried another movie tonight and I had it set to direct stream, but it failed converting again. I had the mode set to auto, so I changed it to force and it loaded up super fast but said it couldn't detect any audio. So it played the direct stream 35mbps 4k beautifully, but without sound.

The thing is when I pee I don’t feel any burning it comes out normally. But after I pee i still feel the pain maybe even worse. It also feels like I have to pee when I don’t. It just feels all inflamed and burning inside of there. It’s been going on for I’d say 5-6 days now. The worse part is I’m on vacation and dealing with this sucks, I can’t even relax on vacation. I’ve had a hard time sleeping too. I made a doctors appointment for Monday. I’m just trying to see if anyone else experienced these symptoms.  It was worse when I took CBD too thought it would help. I’ve also been peeing a lot since this started too I guess my body is trying to flush this out if it is something.",

The recent 1.2 patch made it so you can make the “key item” icon on Johnny’s gear disappear by collecting all of his stuff and getting the Breathtaking achievement. Thing is if you decide to upgrade his gear from rare to epic then the epic version will have the “key item” icon and you won’t be able to get rid of them. Same thing if you upgrade the epic version to legendary. What you need to do is upgrade the rare version into epic then epic version into legendary before you get his pistol. Once you get the pistol all three versions in your inventory will have the “key item” icon removed from them. Then you’ll be able to delete them or store them in your stash or do whatever you want with them.",
    "I do group therapy with my family because my family is screwed up especially my dad and brother and every session ends with them blaming me for something and trying to convince the therapist I'm horrible. Recently they talked about how I dont enjoy doing chores, I dont do them because i score very high in school and it's very stressful. My therapist says they need to control me more. Keep in mind this is the person that's supposed to help me. Fast forward a week I pass my learners permit test, this day is probaly the only day I've been genuinely happy in about a month, and when I come home my dad just tells me to take out the trash. I tell him \" I'm eating right now, I'll take it out when I'm done eating\" and my dad is very childish and he likes control. So of course being the lazy fat and impatient dad he is, he says \"no do it right now\" so I say \"listen, i just got my permit, you are not going to ruin this day for me.\" And he says \"take it out by 5 30\". So I take it out because I'm not lazy like him, and now I'm mad and stressed out when I should be happy. I havent been happy for like 2 months and he ruins it. Take your own trash out you imbecile. Time to wait 2 more months to be happy, who knows if he will ruin it that time too.",
    "I don't understand why people hype up the Ivy League to be this great thing that you must get into. I personally didn't apply to any. Now, I understand that parents put some of the pressure on the students, the tuition is really good, and they all have fantastic programs, but the schools just get hyped into this god-tier status that if you don't get in, you're never going to be successful. There have been tons of successful people who have gone to state schools and have been more successful than those who went to Ivys for undergraduate. If you don't believe me, do a quick google search. Furthermore, jobs don't care about where you went to undergraduate. They care about what experience you have. I know that Ivy day is coming up but I think we all need a reminder that whether you go to an Ivy or not is not a reflection as to how smart you are or how good you are. Keep your head up high and continue to do your best during your undergraduate experience and you'll be successful regardless of where you went to school",

For the past three years or so, I have been consistently getting choppy haircuts with chunky layers that need to be fixed every time. I just got a haircut yesterday. The top 2/3 of my hair looks fine, but the bottom third looks about half as thick and very choppy and bizarre. I’m going to have to cut it again. I haven’t been able to grow my hair past shoulder length because this keeps happening. There’s no way that I just have bad luck picking hair dressers. It has to be something about my hair causing this, I just can’t for the life of me figure out why or how. Does anyone have any ideas at all? Has anyone else experienced this?",
    "In my opinion Charmx isn’t leaving. The fact that it still shows that he still has 2.4K videos is pretty fishy, they could all possibly be unlisted or maybe deleted which could suck for him. My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

    "Whilst playing in the Great War mod I was loosing a war of attrition. The allies had pushed me back almost to Berlin but then I mounted a massive counter attack on the Eastern front and reached all the way to Stalingrad which capitulated Russia. I was pleased to have so much land after such a long war. However, my happiness was short lived as I was slapped in the face by the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. But still I mounted a western front counter attack and pushed the allies back to the Benelux border. My attacks were green across the bord and the troops I had spent the last year preparing were making short work of the entente. But then suddenly out of nowhere I get hit by the Versailles treaty.

    "Hey everyone, what are some tips and advice on how to make your body smell extremely good 24/7? I would like recommendations from diets to deodorants to which fabric softener or detergent to use to wash your clothes, which product to use on your face and hair, which body wash, body lotions, body oils, perfume, showering technique, dental hygeine, flossing technique, anything, to use to make your body and mouth smell like heaven. I can make my hair smell really good, I use Amike Soulfood nourishing hair mask, Morrocanoil leave-in conditioner, Morrocanoil treatment, and Briogeo Anti-Frizz heat protectant. I have been complimented on the smell of my hair multiple times but I do not know how to make my body smell very good. Does anyone have any good body wash recommendations, body lotions, body oils, or perfumes to make yourself smell really good? Has anyone been complimented on smelling good all the time, and if so, what do you use? I have heard the Yves Saint Lauren perfume is amazing and I will buy that, but I was also thinking of just using something to smell good all the time naturally, not exactly with perfumes all the time. And by smelling good, I mean I really want people to constantly compliment me on how good I smell when they get closer, I am not really talking about just preventing from smelling bad or smelling neutral, or decent, but just smelling really good. Let me know, thank you.",
    "So last night my roommates, some friends, and I were having a good time having a bonfire. I decided to get wonky for the social gathering so I kept going back inside to my room to snort more ket. We have like 5 snakes and my roommate was showing one of our guests her snakes but one of them nudged the heat lamp keeping them warm when they were going back outside to the fire. Some time passes and I decided to go inside and snort some more ket. But when I go inside it smelled like something was burning but I didn't think much of it since we were having a bon fire. I proceeded to my room until I got near the reptile room and saw a bunch of smoke in that area. I freaked out and looked for the source and saw it had something to do with the heat lamp. I was so wonked I really didn't know what was starting to burn and catch on fire but I immediately ran back outside to inform my roommates something was catching on fire. They come inside and fixed the situation. Man, that was a close call. Thank god for my ketamine addiction and that I decided to get wonky af that night. I could've not have a place to live today if I didn't want to go back inside to continue the wonk. I just felt the need to share this with everyone. Thank you guys for listening to my experience last night. That was pretty scary when I finally thought about it.",
    "Our relationship is already stressed, and she is going through that phase everyone goes through where if someone dares correct her or politely inform her that she is making a mistake she blows up. I’ve done everything I can, and managed to find a ten gallon. It used to be in a five gallon, and a ten gallon was all I could find for her considering I’m broke from my own gosh and she wasn’t putting any effort into it. She comes to me with her fish problems but doesn’t listen to my advice when she hasn’t asked for it in regards to her fish’ safety. She told me a couple minutes ago that his stomach was looking a little big, he hasnt been swimming around much any more, and he isn’t eating as much/ at all. Tomorrow morning I convinced her to put him into a smaller container for a bit so I can get a good look at him and take a picture. Any suggestions?",
    "I’m still struggling in some aspects of the therapy. I’ve got the Amara View mask, which is comfortable enough. No problems falling asleep. Not snoring, which is great. AHI is generally between 4 and 8 while I can keep it on. But if the thing, Philips Dreamstation, goes 12 or over, i cannot breath out and end up almost choking on my own air. Doesn’t happen regularly. Maybe 2x in the last 2 weeks. I get a good, solid 3 hours after I initially fall asleep. After that, i’m usually up like at least 2 or 3 times and, recently, take the thing off after i hit about 4.5-5 hours just to get some sort of sleep. I don’t THINK i’m having claustrophobia issues. I’ve never had issues with claustrophobia in any other situations. I’m struggling to function during the day more now than before i started on the CPAP. I don’t know. I’m venting more than anything.",
    "Those of you in condo's and detached homes in Victoria, That have mini split heat pumps. How loud is your compressor unit outdoor? We had a two head unit mini split installed in August and it is loud as heck. The installer came out multiple times. Of course every time they came the unit wouldn't make the noise. It happens more at night and when it's really cold. I know they make noise but I feel like the amount of noise this unit makes is substantially louder than it should be. A friend of ours had one put in by the same installer. And his is whisper quite. I'm at my wits end on what to do. The installer keeps saying it's normal noise. But when the tv volume had to be turned up to drown out the noise of the outdoor unit. I feel like that's excessive.",
    "It gives me extreme anxiety when people come toward me for a hug or high-five. This is because everyone seems to do hugs or high-fives differently. In the milliseconds before someone hugs me, I think through how I will have to hold my arms, if they are going one arm up and one down or both up or both down or a side hug. For high-fives, it’s the same issue. Some people will grab your hand when you high-five, others have a weird pull you in for a hug thing, some grab your hand after slapping it and shake it or something. Anytime someone high-fives me, they look at me as if I am retarded when I try for a normal high-five because I don’t know what sort of weird-ass high-five they will try for. Sorry this is so long.",
    "I bought my first truck recently. It belonged to my dad’s boss who pretty much babies his vehicles. Only he let this sit for about a year. I got a pretty good deal on it considering which I wouldn’t normally do if my dad didn’t trust the guy. I couldn’t take it home at first because we found a fuel line leak. We repaired it and we jumped it and it ran really good. Until it died on an exit ramp. We got it towed home and it hasn’t started since. We’ve replaced the batter and now the ignition coil. It will turn over but it just won’t start. It’s an electrical problem because I’m not getting sparks from the ignition coil, hence the replacement. But still nothing. If I can’t get it fixed, the guy said he’ll take it back and give me my money back but damn I really want this damn thing to start. I hate that I can’t drive it or do anything with it",

    "I think when modeling for games the modifier aspect and the non destructive workflow puts blender above most 3D packages in this regard. One thing that is essential though when working with a high to low poly workflow is keeping the geometry relatively simple and be able to adjust it without having edgeloops around every corner. Maya's crease set tool was very good at that and I wonder why someone has not released an addon for that yet, I would really pay any amount for such tool since it would speed my workflow a lot. Don't tell me that you can do this using vertex groups cause it just doesn't make the cut, is too messy and the values of the crease get lost when you start to have a more complex model. Maybe it is too difficult to create? I would be happy to fund it. Let me know what you think.",
    "Signed up for Fraser’s HWPO app and was looking forward to it but it’s been a complete disappointment so far. Didn’t get a password email like the first email today said I would. Figured out I could do a password reset and get into the app. Got into the app and didn’t have the program in there. Checked back a bit later and it had shown up so got my hopes up that issues were over. Not so much. App is SUPER slow, nothing will load and all I can get to is a list of “Day 1, Day2, etc” if I click them it just spins and loads. Has been a complete let down so far. I’ve used various fitness apps before and all of them have been pretty decent and seem to be built on a pre-canned template app that whatever celeb throws their name on and was expecting similar for this one but not so much. This is like a freshman programming class tried to do a school project and failed at it hard. Anyone else get different results?",
    "Like two months ago I was using my newly acquired prostate vibrator, so to get things into perspective I was laying in my back inside my bed just chilling with the vibrator in while I tried to meditate and then suddenly, out of fucking nowhere a huge wave from my prostate flew through my whole body, it was so fucking pleasurable and only took like 4 seconds it even made me open my mouth as if I was about to moan, never had anything like it again, no cum came out it was just so good, after those pleasurable 4 seconds I thought \"I have no idea of what the fuck that was but I loved it\", that shit is the only reason I am still into prostate play cause after that until now I have felt nothing from it again not even a p wave I think, am I doing something wrong, and for God's sake someone tell me what the fuck that was",
    "One time I went to a party in Dahlonega, we started out at Taco Mac getting really drunk. I started getting really frisky so the two guys I was there with took me out back to where their truck was parked, turn down the music in there truck, and we started our own party. Of course I started taking my clothes off and dancing for everybody that had gathered. I brought one guy up on the bed of the truck with me and started putting his hands all over me. Eventually he started touching me and feeling me up, he took off my pants and started finger me in front of everybody. And his buddy got up on the truck push me down on my knees and stuck its dick in my mouth. They put me down on all fours and spit roasted me for a while... Then other people started climbing on the truck, a few other women took off their clothes and we all started sucking each other. Mostly us girls and the guys watching sucking on each other's tits, licking each other's pussy, trying to fit as many fingers as we could inside each other. But some guys were still up in the truck fucking us and putting bottles in us, and other things they were finding, not quite sure what was inside me at some points. But of course someone had to spoil the fun and eventually the cops showed and threatened to start arresting people if we didn’t pack it up.",
    "So recently all my purchased cards vanished from the client. I believe this had something to do with unlinking my original metamask address. I did this through support after linking my hardware wallet, as nothing has been minted yet I assumed all the cards would be minted to my new address. Apparently I was wrong, support didnt answer my questions about if unlinking my old address would have any negative side effects, they just did it and closed the case. They wont reply now the cards are gone and still havent replied after I made a new support ticket. I have relinked the old address to see if that would bring them back, but nope. Some people on here suggested I try the discord but that hasnt worked either. Starting to feel like I'm up shit creek without a paddle here.",
    "For a couple years now my 2009 v star 1100 was having trouble starting.  I would have to roll on the throttle slightly for it to start.  I recently found out that is a horrible thing to do on the v star.  All my research led me to find out that the tps sensor was the culprit.  To be in spec the tps sensor ohms have to be between 500 and 800.  Mine at its lowest setting was 1150.  I read multiple posts where people paid $165 for a new sensor and its was still out of spec.  The bracket that the sensor screws into is big enough to drill new holes right next to the existing ones so that the sensor can turn more and be within the proper range.  I drilled the new holes and tapped it with an M4 tap with 0.75 pitch.  It worked and the hard starting is fixed.nice to get the old girl back to normal.  I love the V star 1100 but pretty said that Yamaha made the sensor out of spec.",
    "Usually I play on PS4, but I still own my PS3 and recently installed it in the living room so my roommate and I could use it as a dvd player and we could play some old games together. However, when I wanted to let her play Journey, I found out the game disappeared from my ps3, I also cannot find it in my list of purchased games in my PS account either. The only evidence I have of ever owning the game on ps3 is a confirmation e-mail from the PS store when I bought it years ago and some trophies I earned are still listed on my profile. Has the game disappeared for anybody else? Does this have to do with PlayStation ending PS3 support? I apologize if this is not the place to ask this question, but I’m unable to contact PS support in my own country at the moment because they are “too busy”...",
    "Easter night. 98 years old. I got to hold her hand, touch her hair, and kiss her forehead. I got to say goodbye hours before she passed. I took pictures of her photos hanging on her walls, I took in the smell of her bedroom, I walked around her kitchen with family one last time. It was such a beautiful day, perfect weather, the sun was shining, birds were chirping. My aunt said to me \"when I hear the birds sing, I'll always remember mom.\" It broke my heart. I love my grandma. I love my family. Every family has its problems, I learned so much just from sitting and listening to my aunts and uncle talk that those problems just didn't matter. We are family. They had so much wisdom and love to give to me. They knew I wasn't very close with her, but they let me sit as long as I needed with her. I'm so happy I didn't wait any longer to see her. My brothers didn't get to say goodbye, only me. I feel lucky to have looked into those blue eyes one last time. I know she loved me and I love her. Rest easy Nan, tell Papa and Nick we love and miss them dearly.",
    "My son just turned 5 a couple of weeks ago. We always give kisses and hugs but I told him for awhile now that I don't want him to kiss me on the lips. I use the term inappropriate because it's the best way I know how to put it for him to understand. He sees me kiss my husband tonight and he said that I shouldn't kiss daddy on the lips. I explained that because mommy and daddy are husband and wife that it's okay. I told him that if he ever gets a wife, he can kiss her on the lips too. And he simply said \"or him\". I told him that is exactly right. He can love whoever he loves. I'm so proud that he even thought to say that because he has been around a few trans people but never a gay couple before. Love is love little dude. ❤",
    "Fast food has some kind of backroom deal with the pickle industry. Notice the hamburger pickle chips sold at the store are far thicker than the pickles on fast food burgers? They are also packed in a weaker brine, so the thick consumer chips require much higher brine content to maintain the pickle flavor. So while fast food gets paper thin, moist but not drenched, just as flavorful pickle slices: consumers are left with thick, sloppy pickle chips. It affects the profile of the burger. How many times has pickle juice washed your toppings off your burger, left your burger too high profile to add the other toppings you wanted, made such a mess with all the juice that anything else on your plate was ruined, or just made it impossible to hold your burger together with a couple of 1/3\" thick sponges slipping around on top drenching everything anytime you tried to grip it? If consumers had access to fast food pickles, they wouldn't rely on the fast food industry for low profile, topping worthy, manageable burgers. How entrenched is this conspiracy? Go to your local deli, buy one of those boars head pickles they have sitting in a jar on the counter, ask the guy to slice it thin with the deli meat slicer. They won't do it. Or go to Sam's Club and try to find fast food style pickles. You won't. All they offer is the thick consumer quality ones you can get at the grocery store. Even though their target customer is small business owners, they know regular consumers shop there too, and they won't risk any of us having access to fast food thin sliced pickles.",
    "The depersonalisation/derealization is increasing. Ive been mentally ill since i was 13, im now 23. The worst its ever been was in 2016/2017, and now its coming back severely. In 2017 i was diagnosed bipolar type 2, but my psychiatrists evaluation was short and he suspected schizophrenic psychosis as well. In other words schizoaffective disorder. I have a lot of trauma and cptsd symptoms. Ive painted since i was 5, and i cant describe with words all of the fantasy and creativity i have stuck inside my head. My paintings went from realism mixed with surrealism and now an increase in surrealism because of my dreams. I dont relate to most in my age and it makes me lonely and isolated. Most people dont percieve the world like i do even though i know there are some out there. But i cant find them. As im writing this im experiencing deja vu. I remember writing this before. I can see into the future but no one would believe me if i told them even though i can even prove it sometimes. I feel like i might not make it past 30 and i feel like this world is more of an illusion than we like to admit, but it doesnt matter. Im just exhausted and i dont know what to do.

    "So I’m terribly , horridly , confused about my sexuality . I’m a very very curious person by nature . I’m curious about everything . I’m a 17 year old girl in a homophobic family if that’s relevant . However , my friends and schools have always been very friendly and I’ve never been told that gay people were wrong by them . Lots of my friends have been bi , and it’s made me curious . I’ve fantasized about girls when I was 14, and these fantasies were sexual in nature. I had “crushes” on girls though idk if I should call them that . It was more being shocked at their beauty , and kinda fantasizing about them . Although if I ever had to date a girl I’d pass . Kissing a girl seems interesting but not desirable . I’d do it out of curiosity idk if I’d legitimately like them . When I was around that age , I’d wanted to be gay . Like I know how weird that sounds but I’ve had pretty bad experiences with boys . Lots of very poor male role models in my life , and my mom is pretty anti guys and tells me how awful all men are , when I was growing up . Some lesbians try to make themselves like men and even marry one right ? Could the same thing happen in reverse ? Fake attraction fueled by desperation. As of now , I find women beautiful the way flowers are , its aesthetic . My “crush” was extremely beautiful but I wouldn’t do anything with her not really . I’m so confused .",
    "\"We knew that fans were hungry for more Survivor--and so were we. We looked at this group of players and thought, 'these guys came ready to play.' And as always, we have to stay a step ahead of them. So we decided, let's put the game on fast-forward. 'You think you can take your time figuring out your strategy and looking for idols? Think again. Everybody else is talking and somebody already found the idol. And if you blink, you're voted out.' I think it's the natural evolution of the game. The last few seasons, every single vote is complex. Every single Tribal Council, the gameplay is aggressive and has consequences. So this is almost a response to that. 'You wanna play hard from the beginning? Got it. We'll make it harder.'\"",
    "I just got a request to help out the child of a person I haven't talked in 18 years. This old and close friend's wife disliked me so I was already on limited contact. But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

    "so Im 21.  My friends are all my age or younger and we are in our 3rd year of college.  They LOVE to drink.  I have since fallen back from drinking, and that has made me realize that I have little to nothing in common with them.  I like my friends a lot, but recently I noticed they tend to ignore my invites to do things that dont involve going to booze late at night.  Even normal, fun things that most people would like to do they arent interested in and will ignore my offer.  I get liking to drink, but holy fuck it seems like its their whole life purpose to get drunk.  This is a very hard time to meet new people as well, so I kinda just feel lost.  When i talk to them sober/when were not drinking and partying our conversations suuuuuuuuck.  Its like I just met them but these are people ive known for 2+ years.  I got a job on the weekends, and so far Ive had more fun at work with my coworkers than I have with my friends.  It sucks.  Its so stupid that society expects college kids to all be wild, unhinged, borderline alcoholics.

There is no battle phase on my turn one, so after performing actions, I'd ask if he has a response and he'd say no. Ok, my board is set and I end on Bow Wow and one Prank Kid. He allows me to set backrow. I declare End Phase and he says he Nibs me at the end of my Main Phase. Can he do that, I gave him several chances within the main phase even after I completed my combo?

    "So, I just wanted to make a little post about the condition of atheists and how it's like being one in this country. First of all, it's quite disheartening to see that literally most of your country's population loathes you for your opinions and lack of belief in religion. In most social media groups of our country atheists are seen as outcasts. Most of us here are closeted atheists since there's a pretty massive chance that our families won't take this matter well. Moreover, there have been a number of brutal murders of atheists whose \"fault\" was expressing their opinions, which lead to their demise. In my opinion, freedom of speech doesn't exist here and it's despairing being in a country where you can be murdered for your opinions.",

Então tipo, eu falei pra ela, que eu tinha me comportado a semana passada e eu queria comer chocolate né, e que tipo, por mais que eu faça as coisas direito, a gente tem a necessidade de comer um doce de vez em quando. Aí ela ficou puta, começou falar que eu preferia os doces do que os amigos, e na real, pra mim os dois caminham lado a lado na vida. Se eu não como doce eu fico estressado e se eu não tenho amigos, eu me sinto sozinho, o que me deixa triste e me leva a comer doce pra maquiar a tristeza.

    "GB is what go me into my love for hot sauce. I have bought a lot of it over the years. Recently I've noticed some small changes. The red sauce no longer has Japanese chilli peppers in the ingredients. The green sauce no longer has Mojo. Today I opened a new bottle of super hot and it wasn't even as hot as the red sauce. I shook the hell out of it and tried some more. I thought it was my tolerance but I tried a spoonful of Hell Fire Detroit's Beer Scorpion habanero sauce and that lit me pretty good. Perhaps that batch or bottle just lacks heat? I know GB isn't doing a private reserve anymore. Maybe the ingredient changes were to save money. I'd honestly pay more for it if it meant keeping the OG recipes. Maybe Dexter is getting tired of running the company? Maybe he is going to sell it?

    "I regularly lose all kinds of attraction for everyone,meaning no sexual or romantic attraction to anyone,meaning no desire to date anyone and looking at content and people that usually would make me feel feel sexually attracted stops doing just that.Those phases usually last between 2 or 4 months and I'm always worried that that my attraction will never come back when I have those phrases,however up until now it always has.Im pretty sure it's not sexual dysfunction becuase that doesnt include loss of romantic attraction and it doesn't affect me in any physical way,its all psychological.Im also sure that I'm not asexual since I do feel all that attraction outside of those phases.I have tried researching my symptoms but I've never really found anything that would match,and it's just really worrying me and I dont even know if its abnormal or  just a normal part of puberty.I also marked it NSFW just to be sure.",
    "So I’ve noticed that viewer ship is all over the place depending on when I post or what I post. I just recently had posts get around 5000-54000 views. I posted again earlier in the morning and only got about 14 views. I’m wondering if when I posts effects my views as much as even the content I’m posting. I’ve also noticed people don’t really want to know about my life they would rather watch me do impulsive things that they more or less want to do but can’t go through with like dying my hair or making things that the audiences hobbies coincide with. The steps of getting viewer ship seems very difficult but also all over the place. Some people use hashtags some don’t but still get 1000’s of views. What constitutes as the perfect time, the perfect description with hashtags or even the best content for your demographic? I’ve definitely improved my viewership since the vine era but it’s all really an equation of when and what. At some point I’m really hoping to find what it is my followers or new viewers exactly want to see but until then I am still figuring it out. Has anyone noticed what seems the best time to post or even the best hashtags to use? What content seems to do better for newer users to help boost their platforms? Maybe some people could take a look at my platform and critique what I post so I can improve. tiktok: ",
    "I was talking with my therapist today about all of the judgements my JNMIL has about me.  We talked about how a lot of these judgements are at odds with one another and don’t make sense.   For example, following my DD’s birth she complained that I contribute nothing to my marriage or our finances, despite the fact that DH and I both work successful high paying jobs where I frequently earn more than him.   Then when i returned to work, she accused me of not caring about my DD’s wellbeing and being an awful mom. Despite knowing that these ideas literally don’t make sense when taken together, I still can’t help but let her get in my head.  My therapist asked why I thought that was and truly I can’t answer.  I’m curious, why do your MILs words/judgements bring you down?",
    "Reading a translation of Anabasis, I noticed that having escaped the Army of Artaxerxes, and made it through the Armenian mountain passes, the Ten Thousand encounter a reoccurring trope amongst the various Pontic peoples they encounter. There are multiple instances where the local villages flee their homes in the face of the oncoming army, and hole up in Strongholds/Citadels. From the book, it is my understanding that these are not populated settlements and are only occupied to wait out hostile forces. It also seems that they were built collectively between multiple villages rather than each village having its own small strong-point. What other sources, if any, reference this practice? Is there any evidence for these small strongholds? In the book, they are often taken by the greeks without a prolonged siege or any equipment so how sophisticated could they have been?",

    "After reading some of the reviews that trash this film I had to speak up.<br/><br/>This film is gritty and dirty. There is content which is not pleasant, swearing and violence amounts other things. What else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? Well more than that actually, it about choices and what you Choose! Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did. At no point did it ever say \"Look at this, its cool.\" For those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in Britain, not just Scotland. I being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.<br/><br/>That being said, those things do not take anything away from the film, the quality of plot and story, or the acting which is Stunning! Robert Carlise as Begbe was excellent, and Ewan MacGregor shined. Also the character Spud was worth a mention he really was quite good.<br/><br/>This film is in my Opinion a work of Genius, that represents the book accurately.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.",
    "Why the poor box office performance?  Why the bad reviews?  Why the bad word of mouth?  I really didn't see anything horrible about this movie!  First of all, it's a character-driven story.  There's little subplots involving jealousy and philandering, but it's not handled in a soapy fashion.  I didn't feel any of the characters were one-dimensional.<br/><br/>\nOf course, Mike Myers steals the show as the homosexual club owner Steve Rubell.  I don't know the real Steve Rubell, so you be the judge whether or not his performance was accurate, but I have to say that Myers did an incredible job!  And I'm not overstating the least bit!  You watch him in this movie and you totally forget that this is the same guy who played Austin Powers.  Not to say I didn't realize Myers had talent prior to watching this film.  He has definitely proven that he has talent as a comic actor, but I didn't know he had the chops to pull off a straight, dramatic role.  Even his accent sounds real, not the least bit phony.  I'm surprised Myers didn't even get an Oscar nod.  He should've at least gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Trust me--you will be blown away by his performance in this movie!<br/><br/>The music is great.  It's always great to reminisce to the great songs from the seventies.  Mark  Christopher nicely captured the whole rebellious atmosphere of 54.  We're given a taste of the drug addiction and even the sexual promiscuity that made the place famous--there's a scene where a couple shamelessly pounds away on the balcony.  I read one person's review, saying that this movie should've been an hour longer.  I find it ironic that people watch movies that are two and a half to three hours long and complain, \"Oh, this movie dragged!  Oh, this movie needed more editing!\" Yet they watch a succintly timed film like this and complain it's too short. This may not have been the most thorough examination of the famous nightclub, but I think it got to the point.  No reason why we have to go into every tiny detail.<br/><br/>This is a serious, dramatic film but it's also very entertaining.  I actually had a smile on my face when the movie ended.  It ended on a happy note without having that forced, schmaltzy Hollywood feel.  Plus, I really like that song \"Knock on Wood\" that they played over the credits.<br/><br/>\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",
    "The Silence of the Lambs is a timeless classic, whose more than adequate storytelling never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most entertaining but least fun films to watch all because of its disturbingly genius atmosphere.\nIt's masterfully acted, especially from Hopkins's side turning this film into a clever and unforgettable masterpiece. Even though Hopkins and Foster don't have much screentime together they still put on a show to remember. Aside from top of the line acting and the directing the script from Ted Tally's (based on the novel by Thomas Harris) is career-defining. From thriller to psychological horror, this movie handles the tone and atmosphere perfectly while switching between the two. In terms of being a psychological horror movie, it does it perfecting as it wraps itself around the viewers' head and proves that gore and blood aren't needed to scare an audience. Surprisingly (and deservedly) this film swooped all five major Oscar categories (Best actor, actress, director, screenplay and picture) even though it was released in February, a whole year before the academy awards.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable feat in film making and you be seen by everyone, a film lover or not. Shocking and suspenseful it is a thrill to behold.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10",
    "The best film in the era of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Supremely well acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize.

Realmete with this film you can compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly.",
    "I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.<br/><br/>\nIt is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. <br/><br/>As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see \"Hart's War\" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).<br/><br/>All in all, \"The Great Escape\" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",
    "Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel \"Hearts of darkness\" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.<br/><br/>The film has a simple premise, US Army Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into Cambodia through a river, to assassinate a renegade, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. It's an accessible premise, allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers, and yet this film is anything but shallow. It's a journey into madness and hysteria, an observation into the darkness of humanity. I could write a book analyzing this film, there's just so much to talk about. My interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find Kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character's inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie, dehumanization. The journey through the river is also reminiscent of Dante's perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. There are three major stops before Kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought, as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.<br/><br/>The first stop is with lieutenant Kilgore. That stop shows that Kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. Their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can't comprehend the consequences the war will bring. In one scene of the movie, the \"heroic\" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies, Captain Kilgore uses Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures Valkyries, he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. At this stage, although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy, they still understand the innocent.<br/><br/>The second stop is the USO show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. At this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself, becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. The soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. Now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.\nThe last stop before Kurtz is the Do-long Bridge and it's at this point that a soldier has gone too far, he's experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can't return to a normal state of mind.<br/><br/>The final stop on the journey is Kurtz, at this point only Willard and Kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness, the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. Kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. Bypassing the madness stage he's able to see the world for what it truly is, filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. Willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. He kills Kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. In the end Willard has a choice, succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken Kurtz's place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon, he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving Lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe, he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. Both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn't, they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.<br/><br/>The film presents this study of the human psyche through Carmine Coppola's eerie score, hypnotic images, and some haunting scenes, essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. It's here where Coppola succeeds the most. His ability to create a living \"hell\" is so amazing, and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. It provides a commentary on war and religion, making the subtext even vaster. The film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film's runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat, and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner, conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer's breath away. Coppola's direction transcends itself, the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows, most notable during Col. Kurtz's first appearance. The troubled production obviously didn't hurt the film at all, and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. Apocalypse Now is beautifully haunting, utterly hellish, terrifyingly intelligent, and magnificently wrought, it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war, but also its meaningfulness and beauty. Not only is this one of the best films ever made, it's a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. It is Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. Rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon, immortal for its contribution to cinema, and a truly unforgettable experience, Apocalypse Now is cinema at its most complete, crystalline and pure.",
    "After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions, ridiculous CG-assisted stunts and mindless action, I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better. <br/><br/>The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle. <br/><br/>De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots, but all are carefully tied into the through-line of the story to match the main character's progression. <br/><br/>The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story, The Bay of Pigs debacle, and traces the steps that lead to it, one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character, Edward Wilson, barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did (the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wire-rimmed or horn-rimmed glasses), but it didn't ruin the film for me. <br/><br/>Overall though, definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand, rather than forget.",
    "Well I guess it's official, I'm eating my words as we speak. Yeah, I'm the guy who doesn't like sequels and yet here I am giving positive ratings to Star Trek Into Darkness and now The Hangover Part III. It's scary to think of what I might do next. If the new Fast and the Furious movie impresses me, I guess I'll just skip reviewing it and go straight into denial. But seriously folks, I went into the new Hangover with really low expectations. We're talking bottom feeder if you know what I mean. So from now on I think that's the key. I'm going to take this approach with every film I see. That way I'll stroll out of the theater as a movie critic that raves about everything and comes off as not so darn grumpy. Whoa, forget what I just said. I was merely kidding people!<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what occurs in part III. At the very beginning, we find mentally unstable \"wolfpack\" member Alan (Zach Galifianakis getting the most exposure he's had in any of the Hangover films) buying a giraffe, putting it in the back of his truck, and killing it on the freeway (I'm thinking you know how it happened). Upon doing this, he irritates his family and draws concern from the other \"wolfpack\" members (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha). Everyone but Alan, stages an intervention on his behalf to get him to a treatment center somewhere in Arizona. He'll agree to go if his three buds will drive him there. As the four of them set out on a moderately short road trip, their car is rammed off the road, they are dragged out of it (held at gunpoint mind you), and one of the crew (Bartha of course) is taken hostage. This sets off a chain of events which leads everybody to venture back to good old Sin City.<br/><br/>Well let's get down to it. Right off the bat I want to let you know why I liked The Hangover Part III. I enjoyed it for the exact reason that some critics panned it. This flick doesn't try to be like the other two in the trilogy. In fact, it feels like a totally different animal all together. Yes there is a dash of the funny (something part I did effortlessly and part II attempted miserably), but there's also a hint of darkness that comes close to turning everything into a sort of black comedy with shards of mild violence. For me, this is an effective way to wrap things up (unless there is a part IV of course). You can tell that the director (Todd Phillips) wanted to avoid copping out and injected part III with a little more juice (this is the other reason I liked it and most critics didn't. They think Phillips went way over the top or felt he had to prove something). He did the film justice by avoiding the same tired plot line (everyone gets smashed and wakes up not knowing what the heck just happened) while making an effort to tie together loose ends from the other two movies (by way of flashbacks). This is done to effect in the first 15 minutes and it sets everything in motion.<br/><br/>The actors then promptly assume their personalities from the first two installments. Doug Billings who's never around for the debauchery, plays the happily married nice guy. Alan, plays the screw loose, borderline mental patient who nonchalantly goes about his business. Phil, is the smug, unhappily married school teacher who is calm under pressure, and Stu is the manic anxiety ridden dentist who thinks all hope is gone. Together they fit their roles like comfortable old shoes. Overall their performances are manically unhinged. You get what's required of them coupled with a fresher more potently nasty script this time around (part II's had lazy written all over it).<br/><br/>As far as supporting work goes, I thought John Goodman (gangster Marshall) was a nice little addition to the Hangover family (he riffs off his Big Lebowski character but just not quite as intense). I also like the addition of a love interest for Alan (someone besides man crush Phil) in Melissa McCarthy. She seems to make a cameo in everything these days and certainly is a hoot as a pawn shop owner who candidly berates her wheelchair confined mother.<br/><br/>The only setback for this Hangover is the blatant deviation from the focus of the four stars of the movie (the infamous \"wolfpack\"). This exercise is bent on giving two supporting characters their own vehicle (Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Galifianakis). True these guys are funny and steal many a scene, but the other members of the cast don't get a lot of room to breathe. They get kind of pushed to the side and become sort of frowned upon (Bradley Cooper recently got nominated for an Oscar, give him some props for gosh sakes). And what's with always having Justin Bartha's character not present with the other members of the \"pack\" when the madness of their misadventures is going down. It seems predetermined and silly. What, is he not good enough an actor to occupy some precious screen time with his buddies (Bartha was in the colossal flop Gigli (2003) so maybe that's it, who knows).<br/><br/>When it all comes down to it, I found myself at ease with the way part III whisked by. It's darker than the first one, funnier than the second one, and more daring than both of them. I laughed, I winced, and felt confident in recommending this hot mess of a movie. It's a sequel all right, but it tries really hard not to be one. I admire that. With nothing to lose, you should go check out The Hangover part III. It's a solid time killer and a required \"hair of the dog\" if you will.",
    "As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.<br/><br/>However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.<br/><br/>For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).<br/><br/>The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.<br/><br/>What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.",
    "I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as \"one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles\" and \"one of the classics of the 70's\". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a \"crazy house\" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.<br/><br/>What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.<br/><br/>-10/10",
    "I am an engineer working offshore in North Sea. I have seen the movie this evening in UK. Is really a good movie, congratulations to all involved you done a great job showing a little bit of ''life in offshore rig''. Looks like in this movie is BP fault but in real world at the rig site everyone has the right to STOP THE JOB if something is wrong or something is going on against the procedures. I have work before in BP rigs in North Sea and I stop the job when I wasn't happy with what is going on I had all the support from the Service Company that I am working for and also BP company understood my concerns. If you are a engineer, roughneck, derrick-man or whatever you are at Rig Site if you think that something is going wrong and against the procedures STOP THE JOB. I do it and I will do again better to lose my job than to see people dying.(Thanks for reading my review)",
    "Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.<br/><br/>Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.<br/><br/>Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.<br/><br/>I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.<br/><br/>I hope my talk helps.",
    "My name is Cecilia and being from Manila this film is very personal to me because my grandfather sacrificed his life during WWII. According to eyewitness accounts, he was tied to a post, doused with kerosene and set on fire. I am watching this film to somehow pay tribute to him and those who selflessly gave up their lives to ensure a free and humane future for all of us. I felt though that the film underestimated what we Filipinos really went through during the war. It would have been just to include the other atrocities perpetuated by the Japanese: babies thrown in the air and caught with bayonets, women brutally raped and breasts carved out, or the massacre of approximately 100,000 unarmed and innocent civilians during the battle for the liberation of Manila on the first days of February 1945. Nevertheless, I am grateful for director John Dahl for shedding light on a chapter in our history that many people hardly know about , specially the present generation, The Bataan Death March.",
    "After watching this movie I can say that no it is not as good as the original but that does mean that it is a bad movie. What I was really excited to see in this movie from the trailers was the scares and the demon nun Valak. The movie does not disappoint and can't wait to see the next entry in the conjuring series!",
    "`The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped, bound and gagged, into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most, if not all, of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet, Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving indifference, to be a criminal-type with a heart of gold, and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline, which exists merely as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed, well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright, sparkling sheen.   In fact, Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham, who makes for a very `cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",
    "Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!",
    "8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.<br/><br/>The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.<br/><br/>The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the \"Free World,\" are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.<br/><br/>Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.<br/><br/>All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.",
    "Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney.  That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist.  He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br/><br/>But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.  Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself.  Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!  Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.",
    "Dawn of the Dead<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.<br/><br/>And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>Grade: A-",
    "This film will generate anger because it throws a \"deadpan\" brick directly towards cultural dysfunction and mass delusion. \"War Machine,\" and Brad Pitt, even exceeded the deadpan message of \"Being There\" a film from a less cynical time in history but still relevant to this day. <br/><br/>\"War Machine\" does a great job illustrating how disconnected the every-man has become in relation to reality. We live in a time where facts are now selectively chosen to support forgone perspectives rather than being absolute, universal, and irrefutable. <br/><br/>We live in a time where personage, perceptions, and public relations matter more than overview, objectives, conclusions, and endpoints. Reality has been set adrift. <br/><br/>It was a brave thing to produce this film because it speaks to a very narrow audience. Most people won't be entertained by the communication mechanism (deadpan) nor will the understand the message. Few people will be open to perspectives other than those which are preconceived. Some people are not aware and thus cannot acknowledge the wounds and damage that political lies have done to the American process and psyche. <br/><br/>To conclude our failed state of affairs, the affairs of a failed nation state (our nation state) I am not with him because he is certainly not with me no matter how much he tells me otherwise. The cohesion of leadership, truth, and the American way has left the building.<br/><br/>It is more of a shame that people won't understand this film, or won't want to. And that is how far we have fallen. Perhaps Rome fell the same way on the sword and misadventure of its own lies and delusion.",
    "\"The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived, without wealth, without property, without official title or office.  Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies, nor the ruler of vast lands.  He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift.  Yet men, governments, dignitaries from all over the world, have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth, who led his country to freedom.\"<br/><br/>This quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film \"Gandhi\".  Richard Attenborough directed this massive epic about the man that freed India. The film opens with Gandhi's assassination.  The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi's funeral on January 31st, 1981, the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral.  It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation. This film was made before CGI (computer generated images), so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed.<br/><br/>\nMahatma Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art.  This film has made and will make millions of people aware of the little brown man that took on the British Empire and won.  \"Gandhi\" serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history.<br/><br/>\nBen Kingsley played Gandhi.  He was the perfect for the role.  He resembled the real Gandhi.  He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man. He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.   He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part. And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the \"big-time actor\" persona did not get in the way of viewing the film.  He did win both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor, for this role, which I agree he deserved.  He became Gandhi.<br/><br/>The cinematography was outstanding.  Attenborough filmed \"Gandhi\" on location in India.  The scenes of India are spectacular, and India is very much another character in the film.  This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi.  Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta.  It is suggested by Kingsley, on the DVD, that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming.  They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman.  Undeterred by their negative thinking, he persevered to enlist thousands of Indians to help make this film.  Every crowd scene, he used real Indians from the area. Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for everyone.  It should be required viewing in high schools, as part of History class.  The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant.  It is also a beautiful work of art.  This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood (see \"Pearl Harbor\" for that). Of course, it would have been hard to screw up a movie about such a great man. 10/10",
    "I walked into the movie theater expecting to see Adam Sandler make a complete buffoon of himself. However, when I came out I was impressed. There was a depth to this movie I did not see coming, and it took me completely off guard. \"Click\" proved to be a powerful, emotional, and humorous piece of work. There was a certain philosophical message in this movie, in which I think, we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work-aholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie, and in \"Click\" he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh. Definitely a 10/10 in my book.",
    "It's hard to say if is an improvement or not on the original, but it's certainly a good continuation of the story this time more focused on Alex's origin and life.

    "There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.<br/><br/>The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.<br/><br/>You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless. <br/><br/>The King's Speech boasts an exceptional cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.<br/><br/>The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year.",
    "I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.<br/><br/>10/10 Highly Recommended",
    "I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.<br/><br/>'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx (all good actresses) could respectively bring out the sweetness, vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy, humour, liveliness, enthusiasm and devotion (towards family) of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.<br/><br/>In addition, the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laugh-out-loud Bonnie Hunt, a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston, a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki (one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves)'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating oh-look-I'm-so-cute child models.<br/><br/>The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio, switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side, the wild and smooth cinematography, slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.<br/><br/>The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well, actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story.",
    "This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",
    "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. <br/><br/>This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. <br/><br/>The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. <br/><br/>The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. <br/><br/>I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.",
    "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.<br/><br/>But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.<br/><br/>I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date.",
    "When I see films like this, it really underlines the programmed ignorance of most Americans, and just how effective the government and the media are at shaping a false narrative. Al Qaeda was never an existential threat to America, and the Taliban was an internecine problem only to local Afghans and different Islamic sects. The conflict and motivation set up in this film is just ludicrous and phony. I am retired US Army, I still have contacts in the service who know the truth about Afghanistan. This film is a sham.",
    "Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for \"Airplane\", \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\", and the \"Naked Gun\" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody! <br/><br/>I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the \"Hotel Gay Schluffen\", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.<br/><br/>I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him afterwards!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If \"Top Secret!\" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means \"She whose bosoms defy gravity\"?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)<br/><br/>The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.<br/><br/>It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, but there's no doubt about it, \"Top Secret!\" IS one of the great comedies of our time.",
    "Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. \"When you re-write a script it gets better and better\" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like \"Nick of Time\" \"The Astronaut's Wife\" and \"Secret Window\" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a \"safe\", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!",
    "Heartbreaking yet captivating, Changeling's story was fascinating all the way through, even if the first half was a little slow. It certainly was a compelling story, shot beautifully, and written well. Angelina Jolie gave a mesmerizing performance as grief stricken Christine Collins, as well as the many young actors in the film. It's certainly worth the time.",
    "In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends because he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it was free, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.",
    "For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the characters in the movie. Sorry for those who's lives were so well protected that they've never been exposed to the likes of us but, that's how we talk and act. It's a type-A environment and we use it to protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.<br/><br/>I am well versed on the facts as provided by the MSM however, as someone in the biz I also know that the fly in the ointment are the facts.<br/><br/>1. The firing of mortars is an art and the mortar launcher has to be anchored to the ground or every mortar will land off target. The mortars landing on the CIA compound are dead accurate and also require spotters to assist with any corrections.<br/><br/>2. Aviano AB, Italy is about 2-hours away. Had they been launched, even if only to do a low fly-by, would have driven off the attackers; just like I used them in Iraq in Mosul, Tikrit, and Baghdad. I don't know why the Commander of the 555 (Triple Nickel) didn't launch. It's one of the big questions that remain unanswered by the media or the movie.<br/><br/>3. Hillary's statement that, \"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?\" was a red herring. Because it was neither. As later testimony bore out, it was a planned, coordinated, terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11.<br/><br/>4. All UAS aircraft are armed.

    "In the midst of the many wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick, it is strange to note how rarely people mention \"Barry Lyndon\".<br/><br/>The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.<br/><br/>Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in \"Barry Lyndon\" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.<br/><br/>The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.<br/><br/>\"Barry Lyndon is\", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them! KimotoCat",
    "It is too unbelievable and too lame. It is unfunny and like a cartoon that is on film.\nExaggeration is OK when it is interesting not when it is a spoof that takes itself seriously.",
    "When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.<br/><br/>Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots. <br/><br/>I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish \"whodunit\" as well. <br/><br/>Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as \"Del Spooner\", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in \"Enemy of the State\" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, \"Independence Day\" and \"Men in Black\". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.<br/><br/>A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. <br/><br/>The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a \"good guy\" or not. <br/><br/>This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.<br/><br/>Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the \"camera moving with moving object\" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment. <br/><br/>In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. <br/><br/>Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that \"I, Robot\" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.<br/><br/>Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie, any movie that gives you fun, drama, action, mystery, and makes you think is a great movie. Thank goodness I, Robot is all of the above.",
    "Being German I'm not really into the Hooligan way of life. I'm just fond of the Brit way of making films and this one is just brilliant. Of course you can argue about whether the director Nick Love is showing the life of some football thugs too positive and without the \"never do this, kids\" attitude, but...this is just a great piece of film. It has terrific acting (especially Frank Harper does a great job), splendid camera and editing and a more than suiting soundtrack. Watched it with some pals and it was just great fun. The scene where Rod tells his girlfriend's parents about his inner thoughts is a highlight. So if you're able to shut out all thoughts of moral and you're just interested in 90 minutes of quality film-making of today...watch this. It's definitely all worth it!",
    "A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Helen Mirren works a miracle with her characterization. When the Queen is forced by circumstances to address her people and mourn in public Diana's death, Helen Mirren doesn't forget that her character is a seasoned public speaker but not an actress. When she delivers her speech to her subjects, the real strength is in her commitment to her duty and not the meaning of her words. It is a chilling, masterful acting stroke. Stephen Frears uses the brilliantly structured script to reveal something that's always being in front of our eyes but we've never seen. The privacy of the most public people in the world. Michael Sheen is terrific as Blair and every piece of casting is truly inspired but it's Helen Mirren's film, oh yeah, one hundred per cent.",
    "Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.<br/><br/>The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous \"blondes\"), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.<br/><br/>\"To reveal more,\" as Leonard Maltin wrote, \"would be unthinkable.\"<br/><br/>While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!<br/><br/>One of the all-time greats. They definitely don't make them like this anymore.",
    "What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!<br/><br/>BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.<br/><br/>Go see this movie!",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "This of course is not a great movie but I just have to give it a 10/10. I have never laughed more in my life. Even the jokes that aren't funny are funny. This film's comedic build up is about the best you will ever see. It doesn't even matter what the punch line is, its how they get to it thats hilarious.<br/><br/>Now this cast was perfect. Anytime you have Randy Quaid in a film you just know the film is going to make you life just by looking at him. Kingpin couldn't have shown this any better as he plays an Amish man who just happens to be amazingly talented at bowling. Woody Harrelson plays a has-been ex-professional bowler who makes a comeback with managing through Randy Quaid. Together they go on a ride across the country making money left and right. Along the journey they are great supporting comedic performances given by Bill Murray and Vanessa Angel who certainly makes the look of the film more appealing.<br/><br/>The Farrelly brothers in my opinion give their best direction they've yet to have. Yet it is the writers who so perfectly set up one joke after another. It seems as if the script is so sharp that their are jokes within jokes. The Farrelly brother handle this material so well by virtual unknowns.<br/><br/>As I have said before this is not a great film but I would highly recommend this if your in the mood of watching something spontaneous. It may not be the most technically sound movie ever made or the deepest but I have never laughed so much in life and that in it self is what comedies are about.",
    "Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with Bill Murray losing his job, girlfriend, and apartment, all in the same day. He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups, exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, \"I think your ready for the Special Olympics!\" Harold also shines in a bit-part in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand, \"You speak some English?\" The student answers back \"SOB and $hit\" and the whole class than repeats it.<br/><br/>The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy joins the fun as likable, lovable \"Ox.\" There are the typical sex gags, simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.<br/><br/>After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine, having silly one-lines like, \"Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do.\" rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe, the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.",
    "I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\".",
    "Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****<br/><br/>What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.<br/><br/>In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. <br/><br/>Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. <br/><br/>Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. <br/><br/>We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. <br/><br/>These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. <br/><br/>Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. <br/><br/>Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>4/4",
    "Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.<br/><br/>Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.<br/><br/>Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.<br/><br/>The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!<br/><br/>This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.<br/><br/>PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive.",
    "The Auteurist Perspective - The most unorthodox way of viewing this picture is as a kind of formalist exercise. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has talked about his desire to make a film tailored exactly to the format of a Hollywood action movie, even going so far as to count the number of cuts and camera set-ups in the blockbusters he watched for research. Everything in the movie may be taking place within quotation marks, as in the melodramas of Douglas Sirk or, more obliquely, Gus van Sant's 'Psycho'. The film wants to be both an archetypal big sci-fi action movie whilst simultaneously a pastiche of the form. The gorgeously overblown shot of Ripley and Call standing amid the clouds at the film's close certainly suggests a playful tweaking of blockbuster bombast. However, the 'Alien' series may not be the most appropriate place for this experiment; the series is far more defined by spaces and silences than by frenetic action of the Bruckheimer variety. Even James Cameron's 'Aliens' is surprisingly slow in its build-up; by contrast, Resurrection's relentless pace becomes oddly monotonous and the film loses the distinctive texture Jeunet brings to it.<br/><br/>The Whedonite Perspective - The problems with the script are mostly additions or changes to Joss Whedon's original (which is available online). Whedon rightly made Ripley's resurrection the backbone for the story, finding new things to do with a character many believed had reached the end of her life, both literally and creatively. He also carefully fleshed out the supporting characters just enough to keep them interesting. There are small problems even in his original script - Purviss is sidelined when his predicament demands imaginative exploration, and the narrative is more linear than you'd expect from this writer. But it's the feeble alterations that damage the film - reducing characters like Hillard (in particular) to cyphers, changing the ending so the audience never gets to see earth (the only place, as Whedon instinctively understood, that the climax could possibly take place), and removing a lot of the texture of the setting, like the marijuana fields. 'I'm a stranger here myself' should have been one of the great closing lines in movie history, up there with 'Tomorrow is another day' and 'Shut up and deal', but the dialogue (Whedon's great strength) is mangled by a director working in his second language, and who seems to be paying more attention to the lighting anyway.<br/><br/>The Cynical Perspective - The 'Alien' series is, by this point, a cash cow that everyone involved wants to milk until it bleeds. 'Alien3' ended Ripley's story with an unflinching finality that 'Resurrection' can only cheapen, no matter how good it is. The hiring of a cult french director is a sop to the critics who lionise Scott and Fincher's contributions - and whilst prior instalments were filmed in England, this production was mounted in LA, for the convenience of everyone involved. It wouldn't do to make too much of an effort on what is, after all, the latest sausage on the string. The suits' only concern is the opening weekend; hence Winona, shoehorned in just in case Sigourney's box office draw is waning.<br/><br/>The Aesthetic Perspective - John Frizzell's score is the fourth classic in a row for the series; both lushly romantic and queasily menacing, it gives the film its own distinctive flavour. The production design is bold and distinctive, with perhaps a hint of playful parody (the sickly green light, the mad scientist outfits, the giant glass jars in the lab); the film looks like a comic strip version of its predecessors. Some of the direction is highly effective - the underwater sequence is devastatingly beautiful. The problem is the slightly over-ripe grotesquerie Jeunet brings out in the material, particularly in the way the cast is shot (Dominique Pinon looks like a malevolent garden gnome, Dan Hedaya resembles a sweaty gendarme). It sits uneasily with the straightforward disaster movie plot. The biggest miscalculation on the production front, however, is the Newborn. The thinking behind it - to give it an expressive face and thus complicate Ripley's (and our) emotional response to it - is sound enough, but it doesn't really come off in the finished creature, which looks like moldy old tissues clinging to a pipe-cleaner frame. Whedon's original conception of a white, red-veined alien of the traditional design might have worked more effectively, although even that might not have survived the aesthetic indignity of its impossible demise, getting sucked into space as a string of alien linguine.",
    "I've been slowly making my way through Guillermo del Toro's catalogue of movies and this is my first time watching Hell Boy. If you're a Del Toro fan, then this one won't disappoint. He's such a superior director - he adds artistry to this action film through his use of shot making, pacing and colour. At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself.",
    "George : Hey guys, remember that movie we all did a few years back called Ocean's Eleven?<br/><br/>Brad : Course we do, we had such a great time.<br/><br/>Julia : And let's not forget we made stacks of money on it. It was a hit!<br/><br/>George : Well here's an idea.Let's make a sequel!<br/><br/>Matt : Fantastic idea! I mean the first one had all of us in it but most of all it was directed, had cool music, had lots of us in it and had a great script.<br/><br/>Brad : The script? Oh yeah, the script, whatever.<br/><br/>Julia : Let's do it. Everyone will love seeing us mugging it up on the screen. Steven Soderbergh's a friend of mine so he'll love directing us again.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, he'll do it. He won't have to work too hard though because it's got us in it. In fact he can just stuff around and experiment with all sorts of stupid camera angles.<br/><br/>Matt : Won't that just confuse the audience and make them dizzy?<br/><br/>George : Stuff that! Just so long as everyone can make out it's us up there on the screen they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : And the music??<br/><br/>Brad : Pfft! Music? No one goes to the movies for music. They want to see stars. Like us! Let's just have any old stupid music for this one.<br/><br/>Matt : That's fine. What about the script?<br/><br/>Brad : What is it with you and the script? Hey here's an idea. Julia, you're so famous and wonderful<br/><br/>Julia : So are you Brad.<br/><br/>Brad : Thanks Julia. What I was saying was how about we have an entire sequence where your character pretends to be you! Everyone knows you're fantastic so they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great idea Brad. How do we fit that into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Julia! Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK. How about we get someone else as famous and wonderful as us to join in the cast? The audience will love that.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, let's get Bruce Willis in a pointless uncredited cameo. He's never been too fussy about what movies he's made before. He's bound to say yes.<br/><br/>Matt : How do we fit him into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Bruce Willis. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK, who else?<br/><br/>Brad : I'm way ahead of you here, Julia. I've got a famous wife so let's get someone who is famous and wonderful, with a famous husband and who they audience will love if they see her and I having a romantic scene.<br/><br/>All : Catherine Zeta Jones!<br/><br/>George : I'll call her and see. <br/><br/>(Ring Ring)<br/><br/>Catherine : Hello. George : Hi Catherine, George Clooney here. You might remember working with me in Intolerable Crueltythe audience loved it!<br/><br/>Catherine : Hi George. What's up?<br/><br/>George : We're making a sequel to Ocean's Eleven. It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt in it. How'd you like to be in it too?<br/><br/>Catherine : Yeah sure. What's it about?<br/><br/>George : Who cares?? It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt and you in it!!<br/><br/>Catherine : OK. But how about we film it in Europe? The audience will love that!<br/><br/>George : It's a deal. See ya.<br/><br/>Catherine : Bye<br/><br/>Julia : So how'd it go?<br/><br/>George : She's in AND she had a great idea. She reckons we could film it somewhere in Europe.<br/><br/>Brad : Fantastic!<br/><br/>Matt : So how does that fit into the script?<br/><br/>Julia : Who cares about the script!! It's got us in it! And anyone who liked Ocean's Eleven will get sucked into seeing it and by then it's too late for them to worry about the script because they've already paid their money.<br/><br/>George : And besides they'll love it because it's got me and Julia and Matt and Brad AND Catherine in it AND it will be filmed in Europe. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great. Let's do it!!<br/><br/>you get the idea.",
    "I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original – just: Wow!<br/><br/>It's clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the 'office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) – this movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for film geeks like me.

    "So once again, after the debacle of Prometheus, Ridley Scott has proved himself simultaneously a master of visuals and yet utterly incompetent when it comes to creating a believable Alien story.<br/><br/>The single biggest problem I had with Prometheus was the collection of imbeciles and weirdos that made up the crew, and one might have hoped that Mr Scott would have realised that himself and made amends this time round. Errr.... no, sadly not. Once again we're treated to a crew of simpletons who make THE MOST pathetic and unbelievable decisions possible. Are we really supposed to believe that a crew would just ditch it's primary mission (that we're told had been over 10 years in the planning to ensure their destination was safe, etc) just because they happened to stumble on a new planet purely by chance? Just plain ludicrous. And that's just the start. A few more examples :<br/><br/><ul><li>Assuming we suspend our disbelief and accept the whole \"let's risk all the colonists and everything we have planned for decades for to land on this new unknown planet instead\" premise, why do these alleged scientists once again TOTALLY disregard the need for any protective clothing? So no breathing equipment, nothing at all to protect them from any alien pathogens. Good thinking!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Faced with a choice of sending either an android, or pretty much the entire human crew with no protective gear, to investigate an alien world, who should go? Yeah that's right, send all the unprotected humans!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Choice of landing right near the source of the unknown signal, or land several miles away and in a foot of water despite there being solid and flat ground a few feet away? Yep, it's wet feet and a huge hike all round folks!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Little alien pods on this alien world puffing their alien spores into the air? Sure, just get your nose in there and have a good sniff. I'm sure it'll be fine!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crewmen get infected by said spores? Don't worry about any quarantine procedures, just carry them back to the ship while getting covered in their vomited-up blood.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alien organism just burst out of said infected crewman? Just open up the locked door and try to shoot it, but be careful you don't miss at point blank range and then slip up on the blood.... twice. (When that happened, people actually laughed in the cinema. I was half expecting a comedy sound effect the second time!)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tens of thousands of dead bodies, and an enormous dead city solely inhabited by David the android from the Prometheus mission, that the planetary scan managed to NOT pick up from orbit when determining the planet to be \"safe\"? No need to ask David what happened, just accept that it's all fine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dark basements to go into all on your own? Do it! Nothing bad will happen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Huge alien eggs opening in front of you? Just have a good look inside. What could possibly go wrong?!</li></ul><br/><br/>The list of stupid decisions just goes on and on AND ON!<br/><br/>While visually the film is generally excellent, the all-CGI-Alien was a huge let-down. Personally I found it considerably less convincing than the practical effects used in Alien and Aliens, which is unforgivable considering the creature is what these films are all about!<br/><br/>Additionally the crew, apart from being imbeciles (as is usual under Mr Scott's direction these days), are also completely forgettable. I saw this movie last night and I can't remember a single character's name today. The one exception is David/Walter, and once again Fassbender does a great job. (Perhaps that's why there's two of them - to make up for a lack of any other decent characters).<br/><br/>The other problem narrative-wise is that both Prometheus and Covenant have actually served to make the Alien universe much SMALLER in my opinion. In the original Alien and Aliens, the creature was just an unknown organism from the far reaches of the universe, and all the more scary because of it. (The same went for the Space Jockey for that matter). But these new movies have tried to tie it all back to humanity in some way - i.e. the Engineers (who are also the Space Jockeys) created both humanity and the black oil virus, and then the Xenomorph was apparently created by David (who was in turn created by man) somehow doing some genetic tinkering with the black oil and human DNA, while living in a cave and playing with his flute. Far from expanding the Alien universe, both these prequels have actually shrunk it by making man the centre of everything, while at the same time managing to sanitise and neuter one of the greatest movie creatures of all time. So what Ridley Scott is saying is that the entire Alien series and the iconic Xenomorph itself was just created by a deranged android with God/daddy issues. How very pathetic and disappointing. I personally hate it when movies try to explain everything to the millionth degree because it invariably ends up as a massive anticlimax. What was wrong with the Xenomorph just being some hideous unknown life-form from the far reaches of space???<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but there's a word limit here.<br/><br/>Lastly, the end is just pretty feeble and anticlimactic. The CG- Alien just kind of gets killed and that's it. And the *ahem* \"twist\" with David/Walter could be seen from a mile away, although David wouldn't have had anywhere near enough time to cut his own arm off and change his clothes and hairstyle.<br/><br/>Please PLEASE Mr Scott, stand aside and let Neill Blomkamp have his shot at an Aliens sequel.<br/><br/>A generous 2 Stars. One for the visuals that are once again gorgeous, and one for a great effort from Fassbender.",
    "Spectre was a classy action movie....making the expected James Bond signatures always look new. loved the suave and class of our favourite British spy. Daniel Craig just re-immersed us in giving us another classic to relish for years.",
    "I'll be honest, I don't think any of the reviewers that have given this movie 10 stars have seen any episodes of the show pre-2000.<br/><br/>I went into the movie thinking it would probably be decent. I figured it would probably be in the style of the newer episodes but with better overall material. That's pretty much how it turned out. Anyone who says it was a return to the older *better* Simpsons is kidding themselves.<br/><br/>The Simpsons greatness was based, in my opinion, on two things: characters that we imagine existing in our society (think the comic book guy, Moe, Flanders) and simply hilarious and very quotable lines. This formula has since been replaced by humor that is situationally based, and quite frankly, just not very funny.<br/><br/>I saw this movie yesterday afternoon, and I can hardly think of one line that had me cracking up. There were some funny moments, yes, but nothing comparable to the brilliant one-liners from the show's glory years.",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in \"Mrs Brown\". \"The Young Victoria\" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.<br/><br/>There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.<br/><br/>Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.<br/><br/>Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford's attempt on Victoria's life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria's accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a \"Regency Order\"; the Duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.<br/><br/>There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a \"Danger! Major cliché ahead!\" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in \"Moulin Rouge\").<br/><br/>The main reason for the film's success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make \"The Young Victoria\" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10",
    "While watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of films and TV shows from my youth, first was any of the original Godzilla films, the second, a TV show Ultra Man. The FX were way better here, but, it just made me think of them. I found the film entertaining, no Oscar winner, but, it was good. Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of course, rooting for the good guys.<br/><br/>I also had to think that mankind would have or could have thought of a better defense/offense weapon than giant robots. To bring a fight into the city would have cost trillions of dollars, perhaps Quadrillions of dollars. Okay, I'm reading way to much into it. Watch the movie, you will enjoy it.",
    "June 8, 2002 was an 80's renaissance for me. Playing an emulated ColecoVision on my PC, listening to Huey Lewis, Prince, and Men At Work, watching the A-Team on TNN, and seeing this film from 1989. I still enjoy the decade of feathered mullets, jerri-curled hair, acid-washed jeans, skinny ties, dominant pop music, and terrible fashions. The 90's will never have that to live down (except terrible fashions, but not as bad).<br/><br/>When Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure became the surprise hit of 1989, it made a star of everyone's favorite Lebanese-Canadian-U.S. rock 'n rolling actor, Keanu Reeves, who is one of the top stars at the box office today and one of the few likeable people in Tinseltown. It seems that he still carries a bit of Theodore \"Ted\" Logan in all his movies.<br/><br/>He and Alex Winter (an indie film dynamo) play Bill and Ted, a couple of 80's California dudes who want to start their own rock band (Wyld Stallyons). However, both are flunking in high school and will be expelled unless they get an A+ in history. To make matters worse, Ted will be sent to the military by his father, therefore squashing their dreams of rock stardom. Enter Rufus (George Carlin), a man from the future who plays Clarence to the boys George (shades of It's A Wonderful Life) who gives them a telephone booth. With it, they decide to use it to collect great historical figures and bring them to San Dimas, California to show them how mankind has evolved.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film holds up today. Bill and Ted are truly likeable boneheads and both Reeves and Winter deliver fine performances. Carlin is funny in his appearances, showing that he doesn't need trash-talk to be entertaining. The dialogue is truly amusing, probably because no one talks like that any more. The only weakness is that it's an 80's film, so if you didn't grow up in that era, you might not understand why there's music playing throughout the film, or why everyone looks and dresses so weird (yes, that's how everyone looked in the 1980's). The DVD version is quite nice, but it only has a trailer as a bonus. Still, a must watch, and much better than all the copycat films (including the horrible Dude, Where's My Car?). Party On!",
    "The future of movies doesn't seem too bright since all we're getting are remakes, adaptations and unnecessary prequels/sequels and that's why original stuff like SOURCE CODE can really make my day.<br/><br/>Honestly, the trailers and initial premise didn't seem promising; some soldier can travel back in time and has to stop an some evil terrorist from bombing America. At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it.<br/><br/>Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. <br/><br/>To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.",
    "\"The Godfather: Part II\" is a very suspenseful drama with a very exciting story, with great acting and great special effects. I would definitely recommend you watch this movie...but first watch the original classic from 1972 \"The Godfather\" . The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel.",
    "Well, I'll tell you what. I'm not a big fan of animated features but this one was a blast and a half. Just when I thought Flash the Sloth at the Zootown DMV couldn't be topped, we wind up meeting Mr. Big doing the Marlon Brando \"Godfather\" bit. I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn't run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn't stop laughing.<br/><br/>I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis's Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.<br/><br/>As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like 'being all you can be' and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I'll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - \"I want to try even though I could fail...\". It's a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don't measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message.",
    "I really enjoy the Star Trek TV series (original, TNG and DS9) and admit that I am late to this review. As much as I enjoy Star Trek and its ideals I had watched Star Wars The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams and I hated that. Star Wars rebooted with completely non-plot for pre-teens and one-liners, wise-cracks and plot holes so big that even Donald Trump's ego could drive through them was not for me.<br/><br/>So, anyway with a certain amount of hesitation I finally watched the reboot of Star Trek.... and it was as bad as I feared. Since it was expected I was not disappointed, but by gosh what is with the people who hire the director JJ Abrams? He makes every character a cartoon character. Never mind that the utopian and progressive society of the Federation is completely glossed over and ignored, but these characters with the formulaic backgrounds and corny lines and false tensions is just terrible. The Vulcans and Romulans' feud has never been as cliché-ridden I would say.<br/><br/>Look, I get it. People pay for reboots and remakes and sequels and so Hollywood serves them up (or is it the other way around?), but use some imagination, have one novel or original idea at least. I am too old for cartoons... which explains why I won't be watching the next Star Trek or fifteen Star Wars coming out. Obviously the director JJ Abrams is specialized in reboots and remakes and sequels and not original ideas.",
    "First off, let me state emphatically that I'm referring to the REAL version of the film, not the pathetic crippled creature distributed as \"Warriors of the Wind\" on video. Although I must admit that I first fell in love with the movie in that form, I have now seen the full subtitled version, and I place a hideous curse on those who hacked over 20 minutes from its running time.<br/><br/>Although the incredible \"Princess Mononoke\" later upstaged this early work in terms of art and detail, in many ways I still prefer \"Nausicaa\". Its imaginitive and well-conceived world puts me in mind of Dune with its feuding factions, its giant creatures, and its strong ecological message. Even with a rather long running time, the story moves very briskly (boiled down as it was from a very lengthy manga series). The music deserves special mention, as well, as it is a large step up from the electronic pop stylings of most anime.<br/><br/>If you can get your hands on a copy of the original version, you'll find it more than worth the effort.",
    "I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.",
    "SPOILER: This movie was just magical.<br/><br/>The Force has become like Harry Potter magic, with a new spell every day or so.<br/><br/>Rey is just magical. With practically training whatsoever she can take on Luke and Kylo and win.<br/><br/>Snoke is magical. He appeared out of nowhere in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi has such fantastic Force powers (never before seen in the entire Star Wars Universe) and yet can't tell when his protege is scheming to slice him in two (but could fell his every throught earlier, and even manipulate him and Rey's thoughts and get them to intergalactically Skype each other and even send water through space).<br/><br/>Luke is magical. He can magically project himself light years away and even bring solid things (the lucky dice) with him. Then dies magically for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Yoda is magical. His Force-ghost actually has more Force powers than when he was alive! Calling down lightning from the sky??? Heck, why don't the Jedi just do that when fighting on Tattooine or whatever? And if Force-ghosts still have Force powers why not the whole gang of Anakin, Ben and Yoda take on Snoke?<br/><br/>Rose is magical. She appears out of nowhere and just happens to go along with Finn on a completely unnecessary mission to find a code breaker, and find not one but TWO code breakers, one of which is in the SAME CELL as they are. I mean, is that magical or what?<br/><br/>Leia is magical. Previously in 7 movies only having the barest abilities in the Force, she now can survive in space for quite a long time and even open her eyes without getting them immediately frozen, and Force-Mary Poppins herself back to the space ship. Magical!<br/><br/>I could go on and on. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it's one shameless Deus Ex Machina after another. And don't even get me started on the stupid feminist nonsense, the inane attempt at comedy, the stupid characters who go nowhere in their characterisation, the stupid casino subplot, the stupid \"saving\" of Finn who wanted to sacrifice himself by Rose who magically now has feeling for him and both of them magically survive without getting shot at by the entire First Order army. Oops, I did go on and on.<br/><br/>If you make a movie, you need to make sure your movie stays in the universe it came from. Not invent new rules, new powers, new super villains, new behaviours from old characters, etc. out of bloody nowhere.",
    "A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>\nDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says \"Russell Crowe\", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a \"hunk\" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.<br/><br/>And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.<br/><br/>And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.<br/><br/>At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",
    "Tony D'Amato(Al Pacino) is the head coach of the Miami Sharks who are owned by the Christina Pagniacci(Cameron Diaz) who is using the Miami Franchise only for profit. Trouble stirs up after long time star quarterback Cap Rooney(Dennis Quaid)is injured along with his back up bringing in third string quarterback Willie Beamen(Jamie Foxx) who becomes the face of the franchise after having great game after great game. The only problem is that he plays only with his head and not with his heart, with an aging team that needs an emotional leader to guide them to victory. Also Starring: James Woods, Matthew Modine, LL Cool J, Bill Bellemy, Lawrence Taylor, Charelton Heston, Aaron Eckhart, and John C. McGinley.<br/><br/>In a cinema that rarely produces pro football movies, this is the cream of the crop. It captures the reality along with the heroic story of a nobody rising to the top. The movie is humorous, dramatic, and a thriller for all sports fans.<br/><br/>This is not only one of Oliver Stone's best films but this is also the start of Jamie Foxx's \"good\" acting career. Forget what the critics said about Collateral or Ray being the beginning for Jamie Foxx. It was Any Given Sunday. Willie Beaman is a complex character and Foxx nailed the part. He was magnificent. He played the part to perfection and out shined the great Al Pacino. The supporting cast was also incredible with great performances from Cameron Diaz, LL Cool J, James Woods, and surprisingly John C. McGinley. It is very rare to find a great dramatic football movie but this is definitely one those small few.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the greatest sports movies of all time and it is highly enjoyable for adult audiences.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.<br/><br/>No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that, you're probably going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.<br/><br/>No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.<br/><br/>The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.<br/><br/>Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.<br/><br/>It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.<br/><br/>That being said, the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.<br/><br/>I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed & bigger budgeted movies, it will be a movie like this one, that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.<br/><br/>And while we're at it, hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive, well acted portrayal.",
    "From hit or miss comedy to Get Out, Jordan Peele proves to us that he has certainly matured as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Get Out is one of the best and most refreshingly original horror movies in the last decade.\nRather than having in your face predictable jump scares and cheesy music, Get Out dwells on the mind and relies on the fear of the unknown while giving subtle messages on racism and what's it like to be black in America and for an anti-racism movie everything is handled very well due to Peele's great writing.\nAs I've already mentioned the best aspect of Get Out is the writing; the characters are intelligent people and behave like logical human beings instead of cliché horror movie idiots. Everything happens for a reason and there is a meaning behind everything. Also unlike other horror movie clichés Get Out doesn't fake its scares or replaces them with needless humour. Instead, the humour (mainly Lil Rel Howery's character) is perfectly balanced with the story and shows up at adequate times.<br/><br/>Creepy, unsettling and filled with brilliant performances (primarily from Daniel Kaluuya) and even better writing, Get Out perfectly represents the US society in its current era.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8+/10",
    "SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.<br/><br/>The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to \"weed out all non-hackers\". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes \"Cowboy\" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes \"Gomer Pyle\" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. <br/><br/>The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.<br/><br/>The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined \"hours of boredom, seconds of terror\" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. <br/><br/>'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the \"duality of Man\" according to Jung. 10/10",
    "Similar to the first Ice Age, the promotional material for the sequel was out in the theatres way in advance, and courtesy of the Scrat character too, up to its usual antics of getting to that elusive acorn. Here, Scrat opens the movie, and emulating the style of the first, he provides most of the laughs, also as an intermission from the actual scenes from the main cast.<br/><br/>Our gang of prehistoric animals are back - Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabre-tooth Tiger (Denis Leary). We learn that Sid has gone into the early childhood business, educating the young minds of pre-historic brats. However, I felt that this movie was somehow darker in tone than the original. While the original was one which dealt with hope, this one had its setting in extinction, disaster and death.<br/><br/>The valley which they live in is threatened by the melting ice, no thanks to global warming. So all the animals embark on a journey to salvation, to that rumored ark which will save them from the massive floods to come. Along the way, our trio meets up with another trio of characters, who were added to expand the cast, featuring 2 Possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), and another, but female, mammoth (Queen Latifah).<br/><br/>Needless to say, Manny's still anti-social, and Diego can't get along with those rascal possums who get on his nerves, and Sid's the \"philosopher\" ever providing the laughs. Various themes like romance (hey, we got 2 mammoths here), friendship, trust, and believing in oneself to overcome one's phobia get covered. Pretty wide scope, but they manage to fit in place nicely.<br/><br/>The villains in this sequel are pretty nasty, besides the looming natural disaster, we have two sea creatures with nasty teeth and attitude, as well as menacing vultures ever ready to pounce on the flesh of animals who have fallen.<br/><br/>But it's not all that bleak. Keep a lookout too for that mad sloth song-and-dance sequence, which has potential to become the next ear worm ala Madagascar's zany \"you-got-to-move-it\" song. The animation is as usual, top notch, and I just can't get enough of the photo-realistic ice and water landscape.<br/><br/>This is one piece of animation that doesn't rely too much on sight gags, of spoofing current affairs, but one filled with more witty dialogue and kept on an even keel with its interesting storyline. Though at times it might feel clichéd, somehow it excelled in its execution.<br/><br/>And that makes this sequel, as enjoyable as, if not better, than the original. Recommended stuff this week!",
    "I was a Texas Western graduate in 1966 and attended the school all four previous years that Don Haskins (\"the Bear\") coached the basketball team. Of course, Coach Haskins came to TWC in 1961 and built his team over 5 years, not in one year as the movie tells it. I went to every home game in 1965-66 and remember every one as if it were yesterday. I watched all of the away games that were televised, including all of the games the Miners played in the NCAA tournament. Even though the producers of \"Glory Road\" took considerable artistic license, the story is mostly true. Here are some facts. The Miners blew away fourth ranked Iowa during a holiday tournament that season. It wasn't even close as the movie depicts it. The great comeback was against New Mexico in the \"Pit\". When Hispanic guard David Palacio came in to play in the second half, the team seemed to settle down and came from a 20 point deficit to win in overtime. The incredibly close game, and probably best game in America that year between the true best college teams in America was the Regional final between third ranked TWC and fourth ranked Kansas (not #1 Kentucky and #2 Duke in the final four semifinal), when Jo Jo White made that last second basket in overtime with his foot on the base line. The Miners went on to beat Kansas 81-80 in double overtime. Then the Miners beat Utah in the first game of the final four. If white player Jerry Armstrong hadn't defended against Utah's great Jerry Chambers, a black player, the Miners probably wouldn't have made it to the championship game against Kentucky. Chambers was beating every defender badly, including Lattin, Shed, and Flournoy, until Armstrong was put in to cover him. Chambers finished with 38 points, mostly in the first half and was the tournament's MVP.<br/><br/>Coach Haskins is beloved by every El Pasoan, whether living in the city now or not, and is a true American treasure. It's wonderful for the rest of the country and the world to finally learn about \"the Bear\" and his great 1966 Miner team that El Paso has known and loved for 40 years. It's much more than a basketball story, it's a story about tolerance and what hard work and discipline can do through the leadership and determination of a great coach and human being.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, especially Josh Lucas' performance as \"the Bear\". His performance was spot on. The young actors playing on the team were outstanding. The early tensions shown between the black and white players in the movie did not exist according to the real players on that team. The book \"Glory Road\" is a must read, because it tells the true story told by \"the Bear\", Don Haskins, himself. I also recommend David Lattin's book \"Slam Dunk to Glory\". The producers should have shown the real life characters, including Coach Haskins, Pat Riley, and some of the actual 1966 players earlier in the credits, because most of the audiences leave the theater without knowing they're going to be interviewed. I thought that was the most interesting part of the movie. The movie and the story deserve a perfect 10. I hope it wins some awards.",
    "Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot in the way of story and character development, but suffice it to say, it serves its purpose. What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. The pop culture references are still present, but I found them to be more clever and funny this time around, and in much smaller amounts. I was smiling through virtually the entire film, and had about 5 or 6 hard laugh-out-loud moments throughout. As expected, I was also very impressed by the voice cast in this movie. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen's performance as B.O.B.. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway.<br/><br/>The 3D, while not used as effectively as it was in Coraline, is still one of the more impressive showcasings that I've seen, and that's largely due to the film's incredible action sequences. Seriously, this is some of the best action that I've seen in an animated film; as far as I'm concerned, it's right up there with that of The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Monsters vs. Aliens to be a surprisingly entertaining film, with clever and witty dialogue, as well as terrific action. I'm not usually in favor of sequels, but if they're able to keep it as balanced and charming, I would honestly like to see this become a successful, long-running franchise. Nice job, folks at DreamWorks Animation.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.<br/><br/>He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.<br/><br/>Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",
    "\"Not only is Singer's film-making aesthetically frustrating (lacking coherent visual rhythm) but his juvenile regard of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler -- one of 15 documented attempts -- is intellectually insulting...\" New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film.

A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in.

I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...<br/><br/>What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.<br/><br/>It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.<br/><br/>If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that \"I was on the edge of my seat\" throughout the second half of the film.<br/><br/>So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.",
    "This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "\"I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time\", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use \"the weapon\".<br/><br/>There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "I love watching movies that leave you just thinking at the end. This movie really did that. Now I'm not really sure why it has such bad reviews but i really liked it and would definitely recommend watching it. <br/><br/>Its not another end of the world movie where your main characters saves their family and end up surviving at the end, which is something i liked because it shows how Nick cages's character has to cope with knowing that him and his family will die and theirs no stopping it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ending and how everything comes together at the end to show that this is Gods doing. You would never expect that from the way its played out, other than the foreshadowing from his son talking about not believing god at the beginning",
    "The first time I saw this film, I was suitably impressed but found I couldn't enjoy it completely.  In order to keep up with the relentless pace of the plot, I didn't pay as much attention to the writing and the performances as I should have.  When it was over, I felt the breakneck pace of the story overshadowed the screenplay and acting, rendering the film an accomplished reprisal of fact but not much else.<br/><br/>What a difference a second viewing made.  My familiarity with the plot allowed me to appreciate all the finer details of the film.   Watching Redford and Hoffman's disciplined performances as Woodward and Bernstein, for instance, is like watching two expert tennis players work in tandem with one another.  When they act together, there is a delightful give-and-take, two masters working their way into a wonderful groove.  While they appear steady and reserved on the surface, the two actors radiate a noticeable undercurrent of excitement and dread, as if underneath their stern countenances they're screaming, \"Holy sh*t!  I can't believe we're doing this!!\"  Redford, not the strongest dramatic actor, finds his normal-guy niche here and gives one of his best performances.  Hoffman is equally strong, making even the simplest scene seem like a masterpiece (the \"count to 10\" phone scene comes to mind).<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Pakula communicates the idea of these two reporters being completely outnumbered by the people responsible for the Watergate break-in.  I loved the numerous overhead shots of Woodward and Bernstein that pull up, up, up, until they're nothing more than specks in the dirty streets of DC.  (This technique is also used in the classic scene where the two guys are searching through old records and the camera pulls up to the ceiling and shows them seated along the edge of a circular series of desks.)<br/><br/>The film rockets right along, leaving the viewers as excited over the reporters' discoveries as they are.  William Goldman's script helps in this regard, I think, sticking straight to the meat and cutting out any unnecessary roughage.  The dialogue gets right down to business while working in realistic vocal habits and the like.  Redford really captures this well (listen to his stammering and self-corrections when he talks on the phone to sources - great stuff!).<br/><br/>I can't recommend \"All the President's Men\" enough.  It's tightly-structured, fiercely-paced, and captivating as all get-out.  If necessary, watch it twice: once to find out who's who, the second time to savour the handiwork.  If you want to talk more about it, leave a red flag on the potted plant on your balcony.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "Definitely not my favorite of the 3 but it's hard when the first 2 were just that good. It still portrays well, from my historical knowledge, much of the struggle of the mob families to legitimize their business dealings and try to enjoy life in the later age of the mafia in America. Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films.",
    "Please take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really write reviews, but I really felt compelled to say something about this movie and it's decaying genre.<br/><br/>I'm conflicted, because I know my opinion is getting more and more jaded with every new superhero flick- but I am quickly reaching the end of my rope here. All these movies feel so predictable and cliché anymore, and as much as I truly want to enjoy them it is becoming more and more difficult.<br/><br/>The main actors in this movie were pretty good, but what can you do with yet another weak story that has already been rehashed in other films. The writing felt subpar, and in the end it came off as being full of gimmicks and convenient sub plot.<br/><br/>It just doesn't feel real anymore, it doesn't feel believable. It feels like a fantasy world created for superfans who never take a step back and critique.<br/><br/>These superhero movies are becoming more and more uninspired, and while I try to give them all a chance I am just getting tired of it all. It feels like the quality is being diluted, all that matters anymore is the quantity. All that matters is the money.<br/><br/>I still hold out hope- just look at the 'zombie' genre. Just because there is dilution within the genre doesn't mean a sporadic gem can't be made. However, if you are of a similar mindset as me, you might want to keep looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!",
    "No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in \"10 Rillington Place\" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in \"American Psycho\". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",
    "There are few elements that actually work in this prequel, but none of them are enough to compensate for the lack of creativity, poor execution, terrible writing and awful looking special effects, ruining what it could've been a potentially promising spin-off from a great character.",
    "Amistad is a very well crafted, well acted, and well told story. It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad 'mutiny', and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America's darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.<br/><br/>Amistad ranks as one of McConaughey's finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. <br/><br/>Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.",
    "A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands' competition.<br/><br/>Unbelievable? Yes. What's more unbelievable is that somehow the whole thing works  Jack Black's over-the-top enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, the edge-of-disaster suspense is continued throughout the length of the movie, and by the end the audience is so desperate to see how the kids (who they all play their own instruments by the way) perform in the concert that seat wetting would probably go unnoticed. Joan Cusack, as the gobsmacked headmistress, delivers a performance that is worth the price of your cinema ticket in itself. Achieving such tears-down-the cheeks laughter and adrenalin-packed excitement for air guitar music is nothing short of miraculous.<br/><br/>School of Rock is a movie that promises entertainment and delivers. Everything is as it says on the packet. For sheer feelgood factor, this movie is unbeatable  and you can even take the kids!",
    "No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. Because they don't need to. The Spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are. But that doesn't mean they should not try to. Why did this movie get made? Simple, Sam Raimi wasn't given enough time to make a fourth spider-man film so he quit, and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen. This movie wasn't made for any other reason.<br/><br/>First off, Peter Parker doesn't have a goal in this movie. At first its to find out what happened to his parents, which isn't explained in this movie. After half an hour he now tries to control his new powers, in scenes that don't help the audience. In the original spider-man, Peter learned about his powers in a controlled environment, he didn't beat up innocent people on a subway train. It's nice to know no one on that train reported that a man beat up five people while climbing walls. But Peter learning his powers can't be an entire focus in the movie, so we kill Uncle Ben. This time it doesn't work because the only reason Peter let the criminal get away was because Peter couldn't get a chocolate milk. To get so upset that he couldn't afford a chocolate milk that he would let a robber get away with the stores money is a contrivance in every way. So for about ten minutes Peters new goal is to bring uncle Ben's murderer to justice, let the police can't link all these look alike criminals spider-man does capture with the man who did kill peters uncle. After a while he just stops doing this, with no reason! And there is still about an hour left, so what are we going to do now? How about introduce that main villain you've been promising us? The Lizard is horribly written in every scene he's in. Why does he go to so much trouble to knock cars off of a bridge just to tell one guy (who is never seen afterwords) that their vaccine isn't ready yet? Because we needed another action scene. After that they bring up that the daily bugle wants pictures of the lizard, a point that doesn't amount to anything, except the lizard finding out who spider-man is. For someone as smart as Peter Parker has been set up to be it was really stupid for him to put his name on the camera he was using to take pictures of the lizard.<br/><br/>The climax doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first being this is the same climax we've seen in about four other superhero movies. The second one being there are no stakes. Only half of Manhattan would be infected 8 minutes after the lizard started his chemical missile, decreasing the people at risk greatly. Also THERE'S A CURE FOR THIS!! You know, the thing Gwen has been working on for the past 6 minutes? Whoever gets infected can just get the cure shot into them afterwords, and as of right now there are only 10 people infected, so why waster your time trying to put the cure into the missile that will stretch half of Manhattan and only effect 10 people?! <br/><br/>Gwen Stacy's dad dies and tells Peter to leave Gwen out of this, and proceeds to still date Gwen. What a great way to respect someone who died protecting people! Don't watch this movie, don't waste your time with this movie, even Spiderman 3 was better than this, so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy, at least those movies had effort put into them.",
    "I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. <br/><br/>I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "2012's Magic Mike wasn't exactly about the stripping. Sure, it features a lot of it, but the real center of the movie was the lifestyle of its main character, Mike. This latest installment showcases more of the crew and how they put up the show. It's more choreography driven than some commentary, which actually made it more appropriate to this material. It still has the stunning style of the first one, though it mostly feels quite forced, but if the movie tries to be itself, then there it actually shines. Magic Mike XXL indeed brings much of what you expect from it.<br/><br/>While the first movie basically shows the art of its aesthetics, this sequel rather shows the art of stripping. The story isn't quite remarkable; it's so simple that it's nothing more than an excuse to show more of these acts, which is both a good thing and otherwise. But really, that's what the target audience really came here for. Just like the first one, it's all atmosphere than following a plot. We just see these characters trying to get along, hint some commentary, and do some stripping. The difference however is the stripping is the real showcase, as in the direction and choreography improves within that aspect which makes these performances speak what this movie is truly about. People would immediately think that this would only appeal female viewers, but even as a straight man as I am, I would actually be impressed by the choreography displayed on those scenes.<br/><br/>The direction does try to keep Soderbergh's style going in this sequel, though only eschewing the intense sepia and welcoming other colors on the daylight. The new style is sometimes indefinite, specifically the vague lighting in some scenes, but then, the movie eventually breaks the pretense once the characters start dancing on screen, having more focus on their moves, and of course, bodies. Star, Channing Tatum, still has the charm as he always has. The other performers also get their characters expanded, staying natural whenever they bond and fight off on screen, treating them beyond than typical eye candy compared to the first one.<br/><br/>Many may call Magic Mike XXL a totally needless sequel or a cash grab for those who seek for more endless dose of shirtless men, but I believe this movie actually exists to make up for its own value. The story may not be as meaty as its predecessor's, but it shows everything what its audiences actually wanted for it. And it is done elegantly, proving that stripping apparently has more to offer than just lust for flesh. It sounds incredibly weird if you say it that way, but looking at these performances seems like this is an art that we didn't see coming. Again, there's nothing remarkable about the story, though if you're curious about the appeal of this career, then it gives a room for fascination.",
    "I give this movie a 10 because it has a message. It has a true purpose to it, which effects nearly every man on the planet.<br/><br/>Ladies, you can listen to this, but be reasonable. Guys, we all masturbate. Some of us do it more than others, most of us look at porn. Some of us only masturbate to porn and some of us have real hard fetishes.<br/><br/>This movie points to the problem, the process of porn turning our heads, making us believe in perfection and making us ultimately selfish as lovers.<br/><br/>You watch porn, you don't have to please a woman, you don't have to worry about anyone but yourself. It is all perfect. In the real world, in relationships, the other person matters just as much as you, but sometimes, even the real thing is not as good as the fantasy and the ease of it.<br/><br/>Don Jon is about that confusion of liking and appreciating porn more than real women, of becoming addicted to the idea of 'perfection' and the ultimate realization of the effect it has on all us men, making us irritated little boys, incapable of truly connecting with another person.<br/><br/>The message is not that porn is bad, only the way we think and use it is misleading to reality.<br/><br/>But, this is not the type of movie to watch with the family, the girl; it's funny, but not a comedy in a spoof and clown type of way. Watch this movie alone, think about yourself and how porn effects you. It will benefit you greatly.",
    "That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.<br/><br/>This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.<br/><br/>The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.<br/><br/>I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.<br/><br/>I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.<br/><br/>This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant \"hungry for more.\" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.<br/><br/>Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful.

    "\"CompNet describes a network of convolutional neural networks whose output is fed into an external processor to improve the accuracy of the extraction of features from fMRI scans. By taking advantage of multi-threaded architecture and the availability of GPU compute resources it provides a multi-layer approach to the task of identifying regions of interest from image data. CompNet can be configured to detect, classify and label a number of biological and non-biological objects.\n\nThe key features are:\n\n- a multilayer network consisting of 8 layers, which can be connected to each other by a total of 256 threads,\n\n- the number of layers in each layer is variable and it can be as few as one (for unsupervised learning), two (for two-class learning), or four (for multilayer learning) or more. There is no predefined limit on the number of layers, hence multiple architectures can be created.\n\nThe convolution networks are not connected directly to each other but have indirect paths through four non-overlapping layers. Thus, the output of the network can be processed in different ways depending on the input of these non-overlapping layers.\n\nA total of 64 hidden units in each layer are connected using the full network in a manner that allows all the connections to be reused. Each of the channels can be configured to hold either one or two parameters, for example, the one-hot encoding encoding (1) has a parameter that specifies which hidden unit should be used for training, while the other (2) parameter indicates that the hidden unit should be used for evaluation, for example, its accuracy is determined from the value of the hidden unit's outputs, while its bias-variance ratio (BVAR) is computed over all its input data.\n\nThe two parameters (x and y) are specified in C code, where x is a one-hot variable that specifies the value of the input to an edge in a hidden layer, and y is a two-hot variable that specifies the value of a channel.\n\nHere is a diagram of a CompNet: The first layer is an activation function whose output value is represented by a one-hot C code.

    "In this paper, we introduce a new technique for scene understanding to facilitate autonomous manipulation in video games. By employing supervised learning, these techniques will be more robust and effective than similar approaches in the past where the user could control the camera and manipulate the world with the keyboard.\n\nWe propose using the camera to predict how the world will look when the user touches a cube or places a mouse on a target object. Given the predicted camera pose, we learn a set of constraints that, given a scene, defines how the user can interact with it.\n\nWe apply these scene understanding techniques to a series of visual game applications where each application is capable of simulating multiple environments in real time. These games represent scenes from science fiction stories such as Blade Runner or Transcendence. They make dramatic use of the notion of realism in video games to create compelling game environments. This paper introduces the method of Scene Understanding that allows robots to interact with their environments.\n\nWe demonstrate the ease of learning that can be achieved using this method and how these learning results map onto reality. We discuss where this is possible in the video game industry since only the video game industry has the ability to create compelling content.\n\nWe highlight the importance of developing a system with the power to learn such scenes from real world scenes. We propose how this is best achieved with generative adversarial nets and learn the difference between these approaches and how they differ in their capabilities. We demonstrate how an AI can learn to do these tasks without a human, thus allowing for future applications of autonomous devices to move objects around in virtual environments.",
    "\"Skin lesions are commonly studied in clinical medical settings, but do not fit the criteria of an active disease. Here we develop an artificial intelligence framework to identify skin lesion types based on the images, using deep feature learning to recognize three categories: cutaneous, hair and eye-ring-like. The neural network consists of a convolutional neural network with hidden layers, followed by an R-CNN for localization. We apply our model to the training set of a medical imaging dataset, and demonstrate that it does remarkably well at categorizing skin lesions. Furthermore, our framework can achieve high precision identification to the nearest centimeter for cutaneous lesions, while failing to detect hair and eye rings. Our system is relatively cheap and does not require extensive external hardware, making this platform available to clinical laboratories that need to develop or apply a skin lesion classification algorithm for a specific goal. A final note is that the framework is implemented in a pure Python and thus has no runtime dependencies and does not require a specialized operating system; this enables automated testing and deployment.\"\n\nAccording to a presentation by the researchers in January, self-learning classification and classification from images has been applied for a few different applications in the last two years.

    "\"Global Fukaya category II is a category in category theory, the name denoting a large collection of applications. It describes one particular category — global connectivity, or in other words, connections which can only be expressed through connections at local spaces. It was introduced in 1990 by David A. MacFarlane, which was in turn introduced by David V. D'Amico.\nGlobal Fukaya category II is a connectionist generalization of a local Fukaya category. In connectionist philosophy, the local Fukaya category denotes all connections between abstract worlds. The global Fukaya category denotes the global network of connections.\nThe central idea of global Fukaya category II is that a connection is connected only if it can be decomposed into a set of finite and zero-valued points. Here, the word finite indicates that these points must be elements of some space, which may be finite but not necessarily linear, with finite dimension.\nAs an example, consider the following connectionism:\n(10.8) |X| = |Y| + ( |Z| \\in G)( |\\cdots \\in H(X)| \\in G)\nSuppose the function Y is a fixed point on  X. The set of points of the connection, H(X),  can then be decomposed:\n(10.9) |H(X)| \\geq H(X) \\sum_{i\n\\in H(X)} |i|  X \\mathrm{D} x = N( ( ) \\langle \\textrm{f}(i) \\rangle  |i| \\rangle.\nThis is another way to say that the connection \\(H(X)\\) is local if it is not a hypern on  X and, as Y is a hyperflection of Y, it is local.

    "Apparent multifractality: The apparent multimodality of L\\(N\\)-self-similar neural networks In this work, we study the ability of neural networks to form similar networks. In this way, we address problems in the theory of the neural networks that have been commonly proposed by those who make a major contribution to machine learning. We perform an experiment that explicitly shows the lack of a multimodality in the network of neural networks trained on two training sets, the first with a fixed number of elements, and the second with a variable number of elements. We obtain an increase of the number of clusters in the largest of the clusters by an amount proportional to the number of elements in the first set (by a factor of 2 in our experiment, when we allow a constant proportion of elements). The apparent multimodality does not imply a theoretical necessity that we call the \"Bubble Hypothesis\", since it does not make clear why we obtained the increase in size in the network with increasing number of clusters. We also present experimental results that clearly demonstrate that the increase of the number of clusters in the network with increasing number of elements is due to a nonlinearity, so that there is no increase in the maximum length of the network. Our results establish that there is non-parametric scaling in the L\\(N\\)-network of neural networks whose apparent multifractality and parametric scaling have been demonstrated in prior work.",
    "(a)\n\n\nMIMO radar allows detection of non-coherent localizations of a range of acoustic signals. It has already been used with many objects and has been used with various animals. In this study, we compare the capabilities of MIMO radar for localizing on a moving object in one of the following three cases: in a noisy environment, in a dense noise environment, and in a noisy environment where an object is in a localized, but noisy, pattern. We define these three cases as the noncluttered, the noisy and the cluttered cases. We compared the capabilities of the MIMO radar on the noncluttered case and its counterpart (a single-shot) and on the noisy case. These were used to determine the range at which the radar could be used on noncluttered and noisy cases, respectively.\n\n\nWe have demonstrated in this paper that MIMO radar allows detection of the noise patterns in a cluttering environment, but not the noise in a noncluttered environment. In order to detect localizations for noncluttered animals, the range at which the MIMO radar can be used is significantly lower than for cluttering animals and very close to the limit of its range for the noisy environment. The range is further limited by the high error that this technique makes in detecting the cluttering pattern.\n\n(b)\n\n\nWe have demonstrated in this paper that MIMO radar is effective at detecting the noncluttered animals, but not cluttering animals. The range at which the MIMO radar can be used is not significantly better than the range in this case for cluttering animals.\n\n(c)\n\n\nUsing MIMO radar, we have demonstrated in this paper that MIMO radar is more efficient than a single shot in localizing animals in a noisy environment. The range for MIMO radar when using a single shot is comparable to the range the MIMO radar can be used to localize animals in a cluttering environment.\n\nThe key to the success lies in the fact that MIMO operates in a high frequency band, making it possible to detect the clumping and to be able to achieve high accuracy, while still using only a small amount of power.

    "A hierarchy of hierarchical attention networks has been developed, in which the model performs simple attentional selection on the feature images and a high-level model is developed to achieve greater accuracy over time. Two systems were developed, with different representations of the images (i.e. a local, hierarchical, and global) and also different learning methods (gradient descent for regional or global models and logistic regression for local models). Both regions and global models showed clear performance gains when trained with an attentional domain, whereas regions showed no advantage over global models. The results of this study demonstrate that hierarchical attention networks based on a global hierarchical model can achieve good performance while being relatively fast to train and apply, and offer additional insights into the computational mechanisms in such models.\n\nThe study was led by Michael Y.

    "Abstract.  A theory of language composition proposes that a piecewise recursive language, one in which the components of its grammar are the only source of grammatical information, follows a certain logic.  Theoretical computer simulations suggest this to be true from a linguistic perspective.  This paper investigates this hypothesis in more detail and tests it experimentally.\nIntroduction We suggest that languages which are piecewise-testable, meaning that the components of their grammar are the only source of grammatical information, follow a particular logic of composition.  In other words, rather than being made from smaller languages, the smallest structure that will produce a grammatically correct whole is simply a subset of a larger structure.  Our approach is based on the understanding of subwords - non-terminals of words that, when reduced to their most basic structure as well as their most frequent constituent items, give a consistent pattern of composition between words (Wang 1999; see also [2]).\nTo explain this language composition point:  we know a language is piecewise-testable as long as the word order of its constituent items is well-defined and each is the single source of any information about the sentence in the language.  Therefore, we have three cases of piecewise-testable languages:\n-- A language where most of the vocabulary is non-terminals, therefore subwords in that context can be reduced to their most basic form and their usage can explain any grammatical behavior.\n-- A language with a word order on the left hand side where it is a non-terminal, therefore parts of the component pieces interact to produce grammar, but it is possible to reduce the components down to their most basic form (most obvious if they start with consonants, since they also share a common phonological inventory with that word).  (Note that a right-hand sentence might not even be composed at all, but a combination of both left- and right-hand words, in this extreme case.) The simplest case for this language is that of English.  For instance, in a context in which a non-terminal such as \"the\" is used as a \"subword\" in the sentence, we could argue it's a case of \"the\" is a subword (and",
    "\"When a tumor segment of the gastric-duodenal junction is fed back into the brain, it is not completely reprogrammed. The tumor segment does not die. Instead, it undergoes local degeneration, which is then re-enriched for its future use through pattern-based reinforcement. The result is that this tumor segment, which before underwent massive shrinkage and was in disrepair, is now reinvigorated and returns to healthy size. The current approach exploits the strength of reprogramming by leveraging partial segmentation. We design a model-free neural network architecture that fully maps on the structure of the neural network of the original tumor segment. We demonstrate the efficacy of the network at reconstructing the original tumor segment and re-releasing it to maintain the original morphology, while maintaining the local degeneration and tumor segment fusion. By using the network's reconstruction model, we are able to efficiently detect the original tumor segment and release it for later use.",
    "Introduction\n\nAsymmetric dual-front models (ADMs) are the most common techniques used to generate large-scale image features using an ensemble of ADMs. ADMs, first developed by Shlomi Fish (Fish 2000, Fish 2003), have been applied in many cases for image segmentation including segmentation of faces and objects and for image matching (Hemminki et al. 2007, 2008). On the other hand, ADMs are typically not suitable for real-life photo-recognition tasks because their size can drastically limit their effective dimensionality. In this paper, we build up on this difficulty with an ADM based on an ADM of asymmetries with a low-dimensional, unsupervised feature space. Our ADM features are similar to human-classified faces but include features for a wide variety of classes of features, including a large set of natural features. We address the following issues:\n\nCan an ADM of asymmetries be trained directly with any existing human classification system?\n\nCan there be non-linear discriminability in ADMs?\n\nHow accurate can ADMs be when trained without learning labels?\n\nCan we perform class-based training for ADMs?\n\nCan we use single-class ADMs directly in ImageNet?\n\nHere is a picture taken from the presentation of this research paper on ARCHE 2015 (see the full paper here).\n\nA Generalized Asymmetric Dual-Front Model for Active Contours and Image Segmentation\n\nIn fact, the ADM we build here has a training procedure that is completely different from most other ADMs. It does not focus on predicting binary class labels like the ones in ADMs. Instead with the \"ADMs as features\" approach, ADMs are trained as feature vectors, which enable us to use ADMs directly in ImageNet. The features include the human-classified features from our study. The ADMs we build here can also be applied even to face- and object-class objects, because we use unsupervised \"face feature vectors\" and \"object feature vectors\" as training input. These feature vectors are obtained from a large set of features from each face and object that we have labeled, and have been labeled by our research group.",
    "Abstract\n\nThe Cross-Denoising Network against Corrupted Labels (CCNN) technique is a powerful strategy for identifying the features of corrupted labels in medical image segmentation. Unlike other techniques, this one is not constrained to use low-precision images. Instead, it requires an image in which all the labels are aligned, which allows for a large number of labels (e.g., from a wide range of features like luminosity, texture etc.) to be extracted without having to discard features which are irrelevant to the main feature of interest (e.g., the label on the right as that would be irrelevant for that particular image). We present a novel algorithm which transforms the original image into a sequence of small images (e.g., one per each pixel). At each image, we transform the labeled feature map by a small number of steps to remove high-frequency labels from one image then repeat the process for the remaining images. The algorithm is able to reconstruct the original image in this sense. We evaluate the CCNN against popular image segmentation algorithms such as LDA in both image and segmentation dimensions. The results show that the CCNN can be competitive with a traditional segmentation. Moreover, we find that the feature maps of CCNN feature maps are more similar in general to feature maps of LDA, whereas their classification performance is close to that of conventional segmentation such as SVM/SVD.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this work, we present a method that makes use of the cross-denoising-network approach, named \"Cross-denoising Network against Corrupted Labels\", for detection of visual anomalies in medical image segmentation algorithms and the detection of image contamination from biological tissues and exteriors. A cross-denoising network (CDN) is defined as a non-linear feature map where each point, denoted by i, encodes a feature. The CDN maps the features onto the original image from one of the following categories of image regions. At each pixel, its value is modulated by a value from one of the three possible map directions: (a) -the original image is oriented perpendicular to the original image direction, (b) -the original image is oriented 90° relative to the original image direction, and (c)",
    "Deep Learning for Drug Discovery Using Statistical Analysis: A Critical Review\n\nThe most successful drug discovery has relied on a multidisciplinary approach, i.e., combining large number of experiments to identify the causal factors which influence the efficacy and toxicity of drugs in human patients. In the case of drugs for cardiovascular disease, the main contributors to drug efficacy include factors related to vascular system, oxidative stress, neurotransmitters, inflammation, microenvironment or other pathophysiological processes. Thus drugs with a broad therapeutic scope with low side effects would tend to make great discoveries. However, the current state of knowledge strongly suggests that this strategy of drug discovery will not be able to find all the potential new drugs with important biological similarities. Instead of focusing only on drugs with a broad therapeutic scope, the most promising drugs in both preclinical and clinical trials are predicted to display a multidisciplinary approach, which includes factors related to vascular system, oxidative stress, neurotransmitters, inflammation, microenvironment or other pathophysiological processes.\n\nThe focus is on a critical review of recent studies published in the field of drug discovery. The focus is on the method to identify the nuclei of the cells for the purpose of deep learning based drug development. The authors propose the development of statistical tools to identify, isolate and analyze cells for the purpose of identifying the genetic bases for the observed patterns. Further they propose the development of the tools to identify differentially expressed genes, also called epigenetics, for the purpose of identifying drug biomarkers.\n\nThe method of deep learning based drug discovery is particularly appealing in the quest of developing effective new drugs. The development of such methods are based on deep neural networks (dNNs), which were introduced with the paper \"Deep Learning of Diverse Topics on ImageNet\" by the authors and it uses supervised learning algorithms to train such networks. It is clear that deep learning has not been enough when it comes to drug discovery, however recent studies indicate that the methods of deep learning have significant potential for drug discovery. The use of statistical analysis is also crucial for drug discovery. By analyzing the data as it comes in, the authors have identified a small number of drugs which they claim are able to be developed based on statistical analysis alone and this method seems to be a great way to identify new drugs. This method is used in real-life applications often",
    "Abstract\n\nFeature based fuzzy rule based image filter generation is a promising approach for detecting object and motion artifacts. In this paper we present a general framework for designing and implementing such rules at the pixel level. This framework is based on the idea that features can be identified and extracted from pixel data using an \"image segmentation\" strategy, a technique proposed in the recent work of Gao and his coworkers at Microsoft Research. In order to extract features from image data, our framework enables us to leverage recent advances in machine learning and data science like deep networks, neural networks, gradient descent, etc. on the problem of detecting features, e.g. pixels or objects. The concept of a fuzzy model for features is simple, the idea is to classify a feature class as either a number (e.g. an \"object\" or a \"feature\") or an integer, say a \"min\" or a \"max\". The features are then classified as \"fuzzier\" and higher fuzzy classification score is indicative of higher accuracy. The image segmentation of features is an interesting problem since it can be solved by building a feature feature space and applying any desired non-linear decision rule. This article presents a general framework for such image segmentation approach, i.e. the implementation of a fuzzy algorithm for detecting \"classes\" of features in a given image. Our approach to segment features based on a fuzzy classification algorithm is based on the concept of a \"feature space\" with its input as feature classes and its output as fuzzy classification test, a feature vector (see Figure 1). The feature vector is generated by a simple linear least squares fit of the training features over the image (i.e. the input) and the output vector is obtained by applying (i.e. the output of) the \"Feature Fuzzy Rule Base\" for the given image using the \"Feature Fuzzy Rule\" feature classifier. The general framework we describe is able to handle a range of features. Some special cases of image feature \"classes\" can be handled by a separate code, while features that are relevant for the overall image segmentation are handled by the same algorithm. The algorithm we describe has been implemented within FuzzyFuzz. In addition to the algorithms in FuzzyFuzz, we have also implemented features detection using the \"feature-space\"",
    "The recent advent of machine vision, in combination with the burgeoning field of image understanding of medical image data, will create opportunities for surgical image analysis and simulation. Although there have been attempts to create a generic approach, each method has been limited in its applicability. This work presents an image-compositing method where the surgical tools and their associated anatomy are identified and segmented through a process of normal mapping, image normalisation, and segmentation. This work is a continuation of other work in this area including some recent work on creating a high-resolution, multi-layered neural network model of the human anatomy using convolutional neural networks. By constructing a model, which represents the underlying structure of the hand and hand movement, that contains individual hand bones and joints, we can then segment the resulting hand model using a network-based method. This enables researchers to create complex human anatomy in the simulation environment using traditional computational techniques such as manual annotation. While this methodology can provide an alternative to manual annotation of surgical tools, some challenges have to be overcome to ensure the accuracy needed for these simulation cases.\n\nIn this article, we describe an image-compositing method for segmentation of human surgical tools. We present a hand-model model that serves as the 'base structure' for segmentations; in other words, this model represents all bone and joint structure. We then use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate and reconstruct a segmentation representation for each individual hand model. The segmentation representations we use are a series of 3-D'shapes' consisting of points at 4 vertices per hand, with 64 vertices per hand. We then use a series of kernel networks to generate a series of'shapes' from the segmentation representations for each individual hand model, resulting in a single 3-D shape representing the hand. The result is an image representation of the hand that can be easily manipulated into a 3-D hand model using the SurgicalToolViewer tool. We demonstrate the use of sfv.segmentation to segment the surgical tools of the hand of a live surgery patient, using multiple operations with surgical tools. The segmentation results can be exported into a training dataset for subsequent human-model refinement.\n\n(via PhysOrg.com; all images courtesy of iStockPhoto",
    "A New Validity Index for Fuzzy-Possibilistic C-Means Clustering\n\nThe Fuzzy-Possibilistic (FP) is a powerful clustering algorithm and its use for unsupervised feature selection has gained prominence in the past few years. While FP is great for classification tasks, it remains limited in comparison to more sophisticated and accurate supervised classifiers. This research presents a novel method of using the fuzzy factorization technique to produce a new factorization that is much more precise and robust while at the same time achieving robustness against large-scale multiclass classification problems. The paper presents several interesting statistical properties of this new factorization, including its ability to discriminate between two discrete categories, its ability to discriminate between a non-linear classifier and another classifier whose linear features have not yet been explored, and an easy-to-apply practical application to a wide range of practical tasks.\n\nAbstract:\n\nGraphic Classification is a highly prevalent task in computer science. Fuzzy-Possibilistic Clustering (FPCC) exploits fuzzy features to approximate the nonlinear classifier as a combination of a nonlinear classifier and a linear classifier. It is a valuable tool for feature selection since it can be used in conjunction with traditional classification methods. It should be noted, however, that FPCC is just \"a toy\" factorization algorithm in its core. It is very weakly reliable and it is well known. Some authors state that FPCC is much harder to train than a conventional nonlinear classifier. This paper presents a novel factorization method for FPCC that can be scaled up to huge dimensions (up to 1024). We prove the robustness of our result, show that it can be applied to problems that are far beyond fuzzy-factored (e.g., classification), and we present a practical application that allows FPCC to be applied to a huge variety of categories.",
    "\"Molecular motors enable the self-assembly of amphipathic protein-like structures, which generate a wide variety of force-carrying forces. A key principle of amphipathicity in these structures is that the hydrophobic side is strongly oriented away from the membrane, whereas the hydrophilic side is biased to the plane of the membrane. Here we demonstrate that amphipathic peptides can be controlled to rotate and stretch in a conformational direction independent of the direction of membrane curvature, and that the direction of rotation can be controlled and altered by the presence of hydrophobic residues. In particular, amphipathic peptides with short amino acid tails, such as those from Drosophila melanogaster, can be transformed into amphipathic structures by providing hydrophobic residues such as the conserved β-turn to the protein backbone. These amphipathic structures can be used in a number of approaches to protein-protein docking and docking control.\"\n\nSo we had a pretty good understanding of what we were dealing with at the very beginning, which is that the peptides in the molecules have a large degree of flexibility, but they are mostly water-based. So, they are not going to take water or anything that would help this side of the molecule slide around. This is the major problem that we found. A lot of these ligand binders have some water, and we could see that the molecules would go around it just fine. The same problem has arisen in the domain containing the two arms of the receptor [2]. So we started out thinking that it wouldn't be a problem to have the domains attached in a way that didn't force the molecule around the water-receptor. That was our approach. How can you have a hydrophobic domain on the molecule on the molecular level and not force water on the side of the molecule that slides around? At the same time, how can you have a hydrophilic domain on the molecule and not force water on the side of the molecule that slides around? So it's very difficult to do, basically these two domains are attached in a very rigid way, and they bind to each other very rigidly, and they push against each other in two different directions. So these domains have a lot of repulsion at the center",

The geometric distance is defined only for the coordinate system of the analysis.\n2. The distance metric is assumed to be linear, i.e., between any pair of objects in the system as well as between any pairs of objects of different coordinate systems. (e.g., for each pair of objects and their respective coordinate systems, distance is defined in terms of the Euclidean distance between the pairs of objects.)\n3. A model of one-dynamic data is assumed. (e.g., object tracking methods).\n4. The distance metric is allowed to vary between any pair of objects of different coordinate systems. (e.g., between pairs of objects of different spatial and temporal scales).\n5. A weighted least-squares approximation of the distance metric is used.\nWe propose a novel distance metric that, when applied to data of any dimensionality, is non-degradely related to Euclidean distance when there exists a non-zero ratio of the number of objects in the data to the number of points in the data. Furthermore, this ratio is defined based on the inverse of the inverse-distance operator.\nThis metric is not a complete or comprehensive theory of distance; in particular, it does not include the following properties:\n1. It does not allow a model to change its parameters to adjust for the different data dimensions.\n2. It does not allow for complex data with a non-trivial number of objects of different dimensions or of differing objects at each spatial and temporal scale.\nWe emphasize that the distance metric is a first approximation to a distance metric.

    "Memory Networks for Interactive VBM Segmentation A memory network, also called a network of memories, is a method of constructing models of large-scale real-world systems. Using a memory network, we can decompose an image into components, and then train a neural network on the images to derive a final model that predicts the location of the most important features in the image. One might expect that a memory network could be made to work well with human-level performance, but in fact, the accuracy of our network on the first test set only approached human level. Our study introduces a new, flexible memory network architecture that exploits the complementary nature of several aspects of visual memory — its flexibility, modularity and non-linearity — by encoding the temporal dynamics of a scene into memory. We propose a novel memory network architecture that allows for efficient training and inference, using both local and global memory to augment or replace the global memory available in many real world application.\n\nAbstract\n\nWe demonstrate the power of a memory network, also known as a network of memories, to decompose an image into components, and then train a neural network on the images to derive a final model that predicts the location of the most important features in the image. Our study introduces a new, flexible memory network architecture that exploits the complementary nature of several aspects of visual memory — its flexibility, modularity and non-linearity — by encoding the temporal dynamics of a scene into memory. We propose a novel memory network architecture that allows for efficient training and inference.\n\nThe image shown above is an example of a memory network in action. The network will first predict the location of the best looking object on the image, and then it will predict the location of other objects as well. Since visual memory is nonlinear — the locations of features change as they move across the image — the network learns to associate both the location of the best looking object and the location of any other objects with the same locations. As this occurs, the network will automatically associate the locations of the objects at each location with the same locations and the correct objects will fall to the bottom.\n\nThe following is an animated GIF from arxiv.org showing this process in action:",

    "For experiments designed to investigate the effect of the number and configuration of simulation components on the results of the simulation, a new package, \"tcpvkd\", was written in Perl. The package gives access to an interactive TCP/IP TCP simulation called \"dune-cpv\". The results of the simulation can then be stored in a table and presented in a visualization tool on a terminal. Because of the open nature of the TCP ports in that simulator, an external program (in this case \"dune-cpv\") can be called to send its own packets to the simulated port. The main advantage of this model over those used by other simulations is that many additional resources (tcp socket and database for communication between simulator and host) are only needed when the server is run on a particular host.

The first term in Theorem 1 is a polynomial for i∈[1, 2) that is positive when the radius (or the average of the two curves) is smaller than N, and negative when the radius is larger and the first equation is equal to zero (where N is the size of the system.)

    "The following is an abstract for a paper on quasi-likelihood for global point processes.\n\nSpatial-Spatial Point Processes\n\nThe traditional approach to solving nonlinear nonabelian system of linear equations has been the Gaussian mixture models that have been used for centuries. These have been successfully used to solve both nonlinear nonabelian systems and linear systems of nonabelian systems. For nonstrict nonlinear equations, the traditional approach has been to search a solution that has a Gaussian distribution in the form of a Markov chain that is an extension of the Gaussian model of density estimation. For linear systems of nonabelian systems, the conventional approach is to search a solution that produces a smooth probability distribution over the parameters under a non-strict linearization. This non-trivial statistical model is essentially based on linear discriminant analysis. It is known that the proposed non-strict nonabelian model is not a good fit to the nonlinear systems discussed above. Here we introduce quasi-likelihood function, which is based on an approximation of the Gaussian model that can easily recover the Gaussian distribution. We find that this approximation can give reasonable results on a large number of problems. We conclude by studying a small category of linear systems of nonabelian systems.",
    "A key issue for biomedical image segmentation is that the individual features of clinical samples, such as tumor size or age, are very different from one another, requiring high-dimensional and relatively noisy data to be processed. While previous approaches have been applied, most have been unsupervised (i.e., in which the feature vectors do not have discrete dimensions), and have suffered from very poor performance (overfitting). In a recent paper, we present a new supervised machine learning method for segmentation, and demonstrate its ability to generate a large sample of high-quality images for both medical science and biomedical research.... This paper presents our new method, which is designed to allow the user to specify a set of diagnostic features (i.e., tumor types) and to select an algorithm that will automatically perform both training and evaluation for a given cancer diagnosis, in a manner akin to a supervised machine learning algorithm. We provide preliminary experimental benchmarking and discuss the performance improvements that can be achieved. After performing training of the classification algorithm, a set of images must then be saved with the label of any new tumors that may be detected. To address our first problem, we train a binary classifier with four classes of parameters (i.e., tumor types, age, and gender); however, it fails to perform well: while a neural network trained with only this classifier has performed well on the CIFAR10 dataset, a similar classifier trained with this one also performs only slightly better on a variety of patient-specific datasets, with the latter having lower patient-specific values for certain features. In the face of this \"inferiority\" of our new model, we propose a simple heuristics-based approach that helps to narrow down the number of combinations of feature values that produce valid images and to make these combinations more robust to overfitting. This simple heuristic model was shown to perform well when we used both classifier and classification methods for training as well as evaluation of our classifier, with the classification method using only the label of a new tumor (which we call the unsupervised \"generic\" classifier), and the unsupervised generic classifier only selecting the label of a new tumor (i.e., the \"unsupervised generic\").

    "For most of its existence, economics thought has focused on the dynamics of production and markets. Yet the production, consumption, and capital markets are largely driven by information, and the information economy is becoming more significant for every aspect of our daily lives. Here, I propose a model of a coherent Averaging System (ACE), which is an overarching framework for understanding the current-day system design. This model is derived from a deep understanding of information economics, applied to the current-day capital and production sectors. To make a coherent system, a system must have a robust design process and robust constraints on system performance; as a result, I introduce the idea of a \"System Credible Averaging\" (SCA) which can be understood as a system that can consistently trade at a low frequency relative to its value. The core principle of the ACE model is the concept of \"System Credible\": This principle has two key components that together give a coherent system strong constraints on system performance: The first is that it establishes strong constraints on the information that is communicated between different elements of the system; the second is that this information is tradeable in a fair or efficient way. My paper explains these concepts through the example of a financial system where the flow of information is so fragmented that an information asymmetric process is required to reliably allocate capital to a productive enterprise. Through this example, I highlight specific design challenges that are present in any systems for trading and capital allocation with regards to the design of the ACE. In addition, my model demonstrates the importance of being able to manage the \"cross-fertilizers\" that are inherent in the flow of information, which are necessary for any design process in order to efficiently use the cross-fertilizers. The ACE model has been applied to the allocation of the US corporate government debt and the current-day stock-market, and uses a method of \"quantum-qubit computation\" to demonstrate that a coherent Averaging System can trade at a low frequency relative to value.\n\nRead the whole thing.\n\nIn other words, it doesn't take too many sophisticated simulations to show how difficult it will be to make our financial system more efficient. The cost of using derivatives to hedge the derivatives is a good example -- what could be accomplished with a hedge program that took only milliseconds?

    "Abstract\n\nThe objective of this work was to develop image quality augmentation for visually impaired individuals with a non-rigid semantic patch technique for augmenting images to reduce visually perceptible noise. We evaluated performance of the non-rigid semantic patch technique using both a standard method of face image enhancement and a novel experimental method of semantic patch image enhancement (SPIN). For the enhancement task, we applied patches with different intensities (e.g., 6 different intensities) and for the statistical optimization method, we applied multiple patches which allowed the enhancement of a face to be performed according to local maxima that were localized by a single non-rigid patches. Our work has demonstrated that our method is sensitive to variations in noise intensity for the visually impaired compared to a comparable method by the same group of researchers that used a non-rigid patch approach and did not find any significant improvement in visual perceptibility. Furthermore, performance improvements were achieved on the same set of faces under the non-rigid patch versus the conventional method. Results are consistent with those of other image augmentation studies that use patch methods with different patch densities [Hansen et al., 2008; van Boxtel et al., 2014; Sato et al., 2014]. Using an automated training program, our work demonstrates that the non-rigid semantic patches are robust to variations in patch quality and image contrast, the patch density is adequate for the operation of the method, and performance improvements can be achieved easily and successfully on the same set of faces.",
    "High-dimensional estimating equations (HEDE) have broad applications, in the domains of biomedical drug discovery, biophysical dynamics, and environmental economics. The generalization techniques that have allowed us to create high-dimensional HEDE models are not very useful, at least in practice. To gain a practical insight on the difficulties we have encountered in doing so, we present a numerical example of the process we have been describing, along with two variants (with different numbers of dimension) where it is not possible to solve the equations. We also present a proof of the completeness of the technique. Our analysis focuses on the case where an arbitrary data set can be represented as a sum of \"subspaces\" containing \"values,\" and are not constrained to have certain properties. We propose a more general strategy to estimate models, to be used with higher-dimensional data sets that have at least the dimension that is needed. We show that with such data, we can model many important phenomena in physics and biology, notably biological macromolecular interactions, electrochemical and molecular dissociation, and non-equilibrium electron transfer processes. While a certain amount of computational effort is necessary in the case of simple models without constraints on the size of the spatial dimensions of the model, our approach is well suited for models with arbitrary spatial dimensions.\n\nThe full paper has been published in Nature Communications: \"Hierarchical and Multidimensional Estimating Equations for Physical Models with High Dimensionality.\"\n\nI've always been a huge fan of the idea of \"higher order approximations\" – in particular, the idea that we can use higher level approximations and use them to do things we could not do before.

We demonstrate that this approximate inference technique can be used to evaluate approximate inference for large graph structures, and to evaluate various different approximations to the degree-4 tree diagram.

    "\"This paper shows that a fundamental equation of flow describing the motion of a gas can be solved using the standard-relativistic flux approximation, and that the solution is not in error.

The flow equation also yields insights on the physical processes in the near-infrared region in non-relativistic optics.

    "Abstract.\nThis work proposes a unified spectral and/or multispectral representation for low- and high-dimensional sparse data in order to efficiently generate a fused image representation based on low-dimensional\n spatial components and multi-dimensional spectral components. The sparse representation is characterized by two spectral components, one low-dimensional spectral component and one multispectral component. The low-dimensional component is a multidimensional scalar-valued vector of spectral component magnitudes, which serves as the basis for the sparse\n prediction problem. The multispectral component is a multi-dimensional scalar-valued vector of spectral component magnitudes that is used in the spectral prediction, but should not lead to multiple component fusion.\nIn order to understand the significance of this discovery, it is important to grasp the fact that in traditional spectral data augmentation techniques such as convolution (discussed later and in Section 5.2), any two spatial components are evaluated in order to construct the composite image. Using this approach, it is possible to have multiple component fusion by having two spatial components and having two spatial predictions. The proposed system is capable of producing one image (or more) by combining these predictions.\nIf we understand how this is implemented in a very simple manner, an interesting question arises. Why does it not lead to multiple component fusion?\nIf we understand the difference between high-dimensional and low-dimensional spatial components, we can easily understand the difference between multiple component fusion, i.e., multiple component prediction. In the example given, the high-dimensional component was calculated by computing two values of the spectral function, and the low-dimensional component was calculated by computing all the magnitude's of these values. It is possible that the low-dimensional component is being evaluated at every pixel, whereas the high-dimensional component is being evaluated only at the pixel's (nearby) neighbor vertices. Using the new concept of low-dimensional spatial components, it is possible to improve the prediction precision. It would thus make it easier to achieve higher spatial resolutions while providing an improved result by avoiding multiple component fusion. Furthermore, by employing multi-dimensional spectral representations in the low-dimensional representation, the low-dimensional spatial component will be able to predict a low-dimensional spatial component in the future, which in",
    "Conditional Generative Flow Models for Images and 3D Point Clouds A paper published in the latest issue of arXiv demonstrates the concept of conditional generative flow models, which use only conditional dependencies and are thus flexible towards the choice of source images and a wide range of target geometry. These models can be used to build all sorts of models intended to generate real-time 3D objects or other types of models. A typical model is constructed by combining a small set of predefined (e.g., a triangle, cone, or cylinder), each with a different flow type. This model is then used to compute conditional flow equations across a wide variety of target shapes from the source images. To provide further context on the generalization of the model to different image generators, a simple example is shown in this paper. The model was obtained by using the FFT algorithm to generate a random 3D point cloud from images of a box, where the first image of the cloud was generated randomly from the source images by randomly using an image that was similar to, but different from, the target image, to create a pattern of random points. The image generator process has also to take into account non-obvious aspects of the target target shape such as curvature, size, and so on and so forth. These differences appear as non-linear effects, which are often masked by the simple set of non-linear equations that were used to build the model. A simple example which illustrates these features is shown in the figure. In particular, in the figure one can see the different effects that a more or less round shape has on the output of the model. The input images of the model were obtained from a 3D point cloud by looking at the 3D points in each cubic group within the points. If the square and the circle had exactly the same number of points, and the points in each group were similar (i.e. if the groups were the same) then the points of the square and the circle, respectively, are both considered as \"closest\" to the input points. Thus in this paper we describe a generative flow model based on this simple 3D point cloud with various differences in the target shape.

    "Recently, a paper appeared on arxiv.org describing b-coloring a graph on co-bipartite graphs and polytime solvable on tree-cographs. A first problem is presented to the reader: the graph can be rendered as a 2D or 3D function of the input variables. A second problem is given to the reader : this graph can be solved as co-polytimes of the input equations of the graph. In the first problem the linear program for solving the graphs is linear. In the second problem the linear program for the problem will be solvable as co-polytimes of the input equations in polynomial time. From this we can make a hypothesis, that only linear programs can be solvable via co-polytimes of the linear problems. The main result of the paper is that it's equivalent to co-polytimes for this problem, and that the problem has a polynomial time solution, i.e. one-time, with the same performance as PolyTime.

    "In the following this paper presents a computational study of the potential of recursive quantum repeater networks. In our discussion we adopt the functionalization of the quantum channel as a probabilistic state vector - this state vector we call the \"PQNT\".\n\nThe first idea for this problem was the simple quantum repeater network described in [9]. This network consists of 2 connected state vectors, represented as the vectors |v i | ≈ {0,1}. These vectors can be written with an embedded algebraic representation as |(v i,|b) i | = (v i : 0, 1 ⟶ |v i | ⊕ |v j ) i : p(v i : 0, v j : b). The computation of the state vector takes place in a topologically ordered fashion, with three steps. In the first step the state vectors are stored in memory, where each state vector is written with the addition of a pair of qubits, such that when these qubits are in mixed states, qubits that describe adjacent states will be mixed. After these qubits are mixed the second step takes place; the quantum channel is allowed to recover. When the quantum channel is in recovery we will refer to the state vectors as \"active\".\n\nIf we consider a real-life example of such a quantum repeater network in a system consisting of 2 channels, a repeater and a relay, the repeater can, if it is activated, provide a transmission link to the relay. In this situation the second channel would be able to send packets to the first channel. The next logical step is to consider a quantum repeater network where there are 2 channels, a repeater and relay. Instead of a relays we would have a \"quantum repeater hub\" which consists of 1 repeater and 2 relays. The quantum repeater hub consists of the same 2 channel states of the first repeater as the state vectors of the hubs. These hub state vectors, we will call \"hub state\" vectors. These hub state vectors are the same as in case of the original repeater network as in case of the original repeater network the hub state vectors are equivalent and carry no quantum information. Only in those cases where the hub state vectors are different to the main qubit vectors, the quantum repeater hub may be said to be a",

In our example, we test the performance under an 8-dimensional domain.

    "\"We build an automatic neural network to segment fluorescence microscopy images. It learns a high-level model of fluorescence microscopy image structures corresponding to the observed fluorophores and predicts the structure of any objects present in the scene. In doing so, it improves over state-of-the-art automatic systems on the same task by learning the underlying microobject structures. We extend the object detection approach with a new object detection strategy that involves finding the underlying structure of a subcomponents not present in the scene data.\"\n\nIn the paper, the authors describe a high-level model of fluorescence microscopy image structures from which they infer the underlying structures. The structure model is based on three components, each of which models a specific aspect of fluorescence imaging: a chromophore for a short-wavelength band (such as red, green, or blue) a chromophore for a medium-wavelength band (such as green, red, or yellow), and the structure of an object embedded in the image. Each component learns an object's relative location in the picture, such that a subcomponent with a higher location probability predicts an object, whereas a subcomponent with a lower position probability predicts a background feature like a speck.\n\nThe network has been trained on 10.1 million unique fluorescence microscopy images, capturing about 13 million times a particular region of the fluorescence image. To see the accuracy, you can use the image below to identify the objects that the networks has misclassified.\n\nThis kind of training procedure is important because it allows one to make generalization about structure structure in pictures, and with that in turn allows one to perform machine learning tasks involving image structure detection. Even better, the algorithm can be used to learn the shape of a specific object that the network hasn't seen in the real world, as the authors show above.\n\nAt the moment, the authors are working on improving the model, including more training data, including \"tens of thousands of microfluorescent microscopies\" to train with.

    "Abstract\n\nThe problem of providing semantic segmentation and semantic coarsening in a semantic content database has significant research interest and has previously been addressed using deep convolutional nets and the fully connected recurrent neural networks. We show a novel approach using fully connected recurrent neurons. Our approach uses a semantic network that was trained to learn to segment the semantic image representation from the unlabeled training image data. This approach has a few fundamental advantages over the previous approaches. First, the semantic representation is learned on a fixed-size set of training image images. As a result, the model can be trained to produce similar semantic representations using small amounts of training images. Second, the semantic segmentation is learned using a fully connected recurrent network which can handle any image content. However, the recurrent network does not perform well on new images. The semantic segmentation accuracy is improved when using a different activation function, which we show in support of the prediction that a fully connected recurrent network with a low activation level and a large receptive field is the best candidate for capturing the semantic representations in the image data. Finally, the approach is trained on image semantic data without having to solve semantic segmentation or semantic coarsening problems. Although new semantic segments may not be easy to extract, the semantic segmentation accuracy is sufficient for most real-world semantic image searches. We show that the results from our demonstration and experiments are robust because only training images with a particular semantic content and a given dimensionality (such that the semantic content is limited in number) will reduce the neural network errors.",

    "The discrete element method has been widely used for many years in the theory of statistics. The methods has several advantages over the alternative continuous-field methods:\n\nDue to random sampling the data is not necessarily fixed, each sample is unique.\n\nNo additional sampling is needed if a certain part of the data is \"random\".\n\nThe random element can be identified easily, and its values used in the algorithm is non-probabilistic.\n\nA problem from the discrete analysis of vector space was to find non-local elements in the discrete system.\n\nIt has been known, since at least 1990, that the discrete method cannot be used to sample a non-sampled vector space, and in fact the use of discrete components for finite dimensional vector spaces (such as the Cauchy-Riemann space of polynomial equations) is not a very good idea. The following text gives a short overview of the basic principles of the discrete element method, and some practical aspects of the use of the method.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe field of discrete analysis has undergone a major change in the past 20 years. Most of the major theoretical, mathematical and statistical methods have been turned into a discrete system in order to be applied in practice.\n\n2. Derivation of the discrete element method (not required for discrete vectors)\n\nIn the earlier times, many theoretical problems were considered impossible to solve. The problem of finding a non-local element in a sparse vector space, for example, became popular after the discovery by Gauss and others of the Gauss theorem in 1784. That is why Gauss was a famous physicist of his time. One could argue that the Gauss theorem changed mathematics from a set theory to a finite-dimensional representation because it proved that many of the problems of pure set theory had to be solved by using finite number of dimensions.\n\nThe main idea of the discrete element method was to provide a non-probabilistic (or at least non-probabilistic in the sense of non-perturbative) way to solve that type of problem for discrete discrete elements. Another interesting aspect of that method is that it is based completely on the discrete nature of the real numbers. The discrete element of a real vector space is obtained by:\n\nwhere is the",
    "A general bistable solution is characterized by minimizing the difference in gradient. The solution has a bistable property if the gradient for a positive element x t of the linear operators is zero when evaluated at coordinate y t. When applied to a point 𝒜, as in equations (2) and (6) of this paper, a bistable solution has a bistable curvature if\nwhere μ is a monotonically increasing quadratic factor of the bistable curvature, and. For a nonzero monotonically increasing factor μ, then σ 2 is a bistable solution. In other words, a bistable solution is the same as a monotonically decreasing scalar curvature. A monotonically increasing scalar curvature is bistable if and only if it is linear.\nAlthough more complicated than the simple example shown earlier, the bistable solution of a point equation can always be calculated with only two variables and one constant. The bistability of this equation comes from the fact that the solutions with and are essentially the same in degree (although in two dimensions a solution has four degrees of freedom ).\nThis can be demonstrated by making the following geometric model. It is a simplified version of the \"twin equations\" solution of a 2D 2nd order differential equation\nwhere is a constant of integration, is the point at which the two components of the gradient 𝒜 are equal,, and is the second order partial derivative of the difference in gradient.

    "This paper investigates the effect of the length of the longest sequence in a graph (an approximation to the degree distribution) on the rank of nodes. For graphs where N<K+1, the rank of the shortest node is not invariant under the length of a sequence.

The rank of the tallest node, defined as the number of positive integer-valued edges that are connected to him/her, shows highly significant effects of the length of the longest sequence in the graph compared to the rank of the shortest node, even after accounting for the effects of rotation and growth of the graph.\n\nI think it is time for us to stop using \"almost\" in mathematics and begin to use the word \"hyperparameterized\" more often.

In this paper we present a very basic application of the Gromov-Witten invariance to consider the case of a field of topological spaces on which all the eigenvalues are $1$. Our primary result is that the Gromov-Witten invariance of these spaces guarantees that the Fourier transform of space does not change when the space is finite dimensional. We show that this invariance is sufficient for our purposes, given that we expect the space to be finitely dimensional. For finite dimensional spaces such as $\\mathbb{Q}^d$, our results are not affected by the fact that $\\mathbb{Q}$ has no topological symmetries.

    "\"One goal of image segmentation is to enable health researchers to understand and track health effects of a medical device or medicine. Yet there are several common sources or sources of unannotated images, and general principles about how to determine the segmentation of image objects have been established by researchers as long ago as the 1970s. Nevertheless, many other challenges remain such as: identifying objects, selecting the best object from available objects or objects of the same size, and determining a correct segmentation in all of the objects as they come into the pipeline. These challenges are exemplified in figure 10 where we consider 2 different types of objects that should be identified. 1) objects such as finger nails, pencils, lancets, pills, and other small or delicate objects; and 2) complex objects such as surgical instruments and other complex medical devices.\n\nIn general, segmentation works best in cases where a subset of objects can be separated by a non-overlapping boundary.

Results show that this probabilistic representation of segmentations and object recognition in particular is able to achieve the state of art performance of the class-specific object recognition algorithms. The probabilistic model for segmentation is a novel approach that is based on a probabilistic graphical model which produces probabilistic values for the segmentations (elements of the images) and can discriminate between different objects. In addition, we use a state of the art state-of-the art object recognition system to identify individual objects.

    "Non-signaling anonymity is a type of cryptography that protects against adversaries who target discrete log data. Signaling is the secret exchange of messages between two communicating nodes in which no one is expected to have the key. The main difference between non-signaling and signaling is that, while signaling requires a random key exchange, non-signaling works by providing the key to the user without any exchange being performed between the user and the server. It is a form of authentication system using a combination of random signatures and cryptographic anonymity. To demonstrate the non-signaling anonymity-enhancing properties of ECDSA, we implement a general system capable of guaranteeing confidentiality of signed data while preserving the ability to detect signing after the fact. We present a scheme consisting of a cryptographic verifier and a key recovery scheme using the standard techniques of random number generation and elliptic curve cryptography. In the standard practice, the verifier is the server, which is not capable of performing key recovery and so is vulnerable to brute-force attack. Furthermore, there is no way to verify whether or not the signing is truly being performed by the server. We demonstrate the non-signaling anonymity-enhancing properties of ECDSA by constructing the non-signaling RSA implementation that does not perform a key recovery step. Our system is fully authenticated against a two-factor attack and provides a privacy-preserving anonymity of the signing activity even when the server's key is intercepted by a third-party. Using a different form of authentication (via signatures of the server's public key), we derive the \"signing\" verification results for a full signature, which we can then verify in situ. Our theoretical discussion of the attack on a signature provides a means of ensuring confidentiality for signed data. Our implementation is in an in-memory form and can be implemented on top of existing systems.\n\n(via @Sid)\n\nMore from BSC Research:\n\n[PDF] Why digital signatures aren't really private by Sébastien LaRochelle\n\n[Slides] How To Use ECC: Encryption, Signing and Authentification by Jérémie Zimmermann",

In this paper we introduce some novel methods for finding a semi-supervised multi-way classification from image data in a highly distributed environment. Our framework takes advantage of a novel dataset, consisting of 942 images of different types as well as 12 different medical conditions, to automatically detect various types of medical conditions by using medical condition labels (e.g. brain tumor). To find a suitable classification from an image, we train and evaluate two semi-supervised image segmentation algorithms using the medical condition labels. Both methods use a small number of images. Our framework automatically creates and inserts images into the training set after segmentation. The resulting system performs well on the first validation test and with few data points, it is able to perform well on the other validation test. We are able to provide a good trade-off between data size and accuracy, i.e. the data size is small while the accuracy is high. The performance of our semi-supervised algorithms is comparable to those in published papers. These methods are motivated by the fact that previous approaches, for instance the ImageNet classification method [Bolus et al., 2014] and the LeNet semi-supervised classification method [Kirchhoffers et al., 2016], require multiple images to perform their classification and the number of training images is high. This is likely to cause high variance in the training data, thus making the learning process unbalanced. The new semi-supervised image segmentation framework uses only a small number of training images, and this causes a",
    "In this paper, we present convolutional random walk networks (CRWNNs) that are trained to classify and quantify semantic images. For training purpose, we used two models: 1) a conventional unsupervised model that is able to perform well on the test set without any training data, and 2) a network trained to produce classification probabilities. These two models are very similar, except the latter model is trained in the continuous case, where the image is given as a vector and an activation function of this vector with parameters the number of points, the type of activation function, the input to the network and its output. The final design of the output is determined after the network is trained. For example, by using a deep convolutional network (ConvNet) of network activations and weights, we produce a very good classifier. This classifier achieves 87% accuracy based on the 50 most labeled images in MNIST. The ability to extract semantic and abstract concepts in a semantic image from a sample input was also demonstrated by our network, leading to classification accuracies of over 81% and 83% on the training set, respectively.\n\nHere, a deep convolution network is used. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural network (CNN) that has learned to extract an output as a continuous feature vector with a small number of input variables, thus minimizing the sum of the distances between two points. This is done using a convolution filter which is applied over the input image. The filters in CNNs are typically learned by sampling the filter outputs and apply gradient descent to minimize the sum of the distances between the input image and the filtered output. CNNs use nonlinearity to minimize the sum-of-differential cost with an input image. Thus, a single input image has a relatively fixed number of filters (which are typically convolution filters, since convolutions are also nonlinear). As we can see, a CNN has the ability to learn nonlinearities without the use of a pre-trained network as we will show later. However, prior to running CNN in an image classification task, some training data has to be provided or the network cannot learn an optimal output or an output for a given input. So, the training is often done with a test set and the first goal of",
    "The use of the human body to perform advanced computer vision tasks is currently a relatively new phenomenon. However, the field of machine learning with the specific goal of improving the detection of hidden images of the human body has received wide attention recently as a result of the work of Chen and Sossopoulos from the University of Oxford and Tan and Sperk from the University of New South Wales. Our model, based on the idea of a hidden face feature, is based on the notion of a hidden detector which combines many different image detectors in order to detect edges between images and reconstruct the original subject.\n\nAs a first prototype of our implementation, we demonstrated the ability to detect an object on a full-body mammogram image by utilizing the detection of a soft body from a small part of the mammogram image. In this model, the detector uses a combination of three image detectors—an edge detector, segmentation detector, and detection algorithm—to detect a soft object that may be hidden in the image. This model also allows us to perform edge detection on arbitrary images for which the corresponding detector is missing.\n\nOur method is based on a hybrid soft computing approach. We combine a deep convolutional neural network based on an unsupervised classifier, the full-body detector which is also a convolutional layer, a feature detector based on a deep kernel convolution layer, and a fully connected training setup with backpropagation to improve the performance of the detector. The model is trained by performing 1000 runs of 10 000 iterations with a mean iteration size of 10, and an adaptive learning rate for low learning rate environments. In our experiment, we showed that our method enables the detection of a hidden object on a full-body mammography image successfully.\n\nIn future work we plan to investigate detection of mammographic abnormalities that aren't obvious at first sight as well as detection in the general population of women who pose no threat to security.",
    "J.L. Lee et al. (2015). Spatio-temporal Lagrangian Methods for Non-Thermal Fluctuations with Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangians. We propose to analyze the problem of fluid-Structure Interactions with Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangians on the 2.5D, 3D and 6.5D solids. As a first example example, we describe the simulation of some simple incompressible flows, which behave like a 2D, 3D or 6.5D fluid. For both 2D and 3D, we consider the case of incompressible flows which are stationary, the case of which is very popular. For 2D flows, we are interested in cases in which the surface is flat, which is not the case in 3D where flat surfaces are more common. This article provides a description of some basic techniques, which we call Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian Methods (SELM), for studying incompressible flows: 1) We describe different Lagrangians for incompressible flows. 2) We introduce the Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian methods for various flows and compare different methods in detail. For incompressible flows described as 2D, we analyze two cases of incompressible flows: flat surfaces and a cylinder-like flow. For a cylinder-like flow, we introduce an initial condition, which in the stationary case is simply the initial velocity of the fluid. 3) We discuss the non-stationary case and show that both cases have essentially the same solution in the stationary case. This gives a good insight into the difficulties faced by Lagrangians on the 2D case, in particular by finding a reasonable initial condition. Also, we introduce the Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian methods for 2D cases, including a method from the field of Lagrange Equations for computing the initial velocity of the fluid. Furthermore, we introduce the Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian methods for the 2D case: for 6.5D flows we define a Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian Lagrangian for a cyclic, which defines a new initial condition for a cyclic which is the same as the initial condition for",
    "Overview of Methods\n\nWe develop the first system with deep convolutional neural networks and an efficient image compression architecture, developed for medical image compression. We demonstrate several cases in which a standard human-viewable medical image is compressed, showing significantly improved compression. Our algorithm allows an image to be compressed using only 32 images with a high-level of quality and low network complexity, with an explicit compression method that only scales to our network size and has an explicit loss function for data that does not match the input. We extend existing medical imaging compression algorithms by combining many existing methods of reduction, including convolutional neural networks with single-image feature detectors. The algorithms are also demonstrated to be scalable without changes to previous compressed images. We demonstrate the system's efficiency and scalable architecture by optimizing a medical image training set of 200,000 images and by developing an efficient compression and segmentation algorithm which runs in the cloud on GPUs.\n\nCitation (DoD ID: DPI-CT-2017-00024)\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this paper we are providing the first machine vision enabled medical image compression for the cloud. We develop an extremely efficient 3D medical image sequence compression protocol with a deep convolutional neural network that generates a compressed image from each dimensionally centered image in a given image session. Our compressed image compression is based on a linear dimensionality reduction that utilizes multiple training layers and segmentation. As a result, a single medical image can be obtained with a high-quality, high-complexity image or image sequence. The compressed medical image is generated from a set of medical image samples for a different anatomical region, with less redundancy than would be required for full medical imaging. In addition to a large number of image layers, we provide a compressed medical image analysis layer to extract the image features from each image. These algorithms are both scalable to large networks and are independent of the medical image data source. Finally, we provide extensive benchmarks to demonstrate the system's efficiency and scalable architecture. We demonstrate the system's efficiency when optimizing a training set of 200,000 medical images, and demonstrate its scalable architecture when analyzing a pre-trained medical image data set for a particular anatomical region.\n\nCitation (PubLink):\n\nPDF (DOI):\n\n\nBibTeX:",
    "Mincut: an Information-theoretic derivation of the min-cut clustering algorithm.\n\n\nThe min-cut technique is often used as an evaluation measure for the computational efficiency of algorithms in clustering tasks. If min-cut are applied to a statistical or machine learning methodology, it becomes evident that the statistical and machine learning algorithms converge to the same conclusion. However, a critical problem regarding min-cut is its applicability to the case of clustering in a general-purpose, large number of variables setting. In contrast to small subsets of the parameters, min-cut do not take into account that these are clustered over larger numbers of variables, which leads to incorrect conclusions [12]. Mincut is usually defined by applying a linear reduction and iteratively increasing the min cut, but it has been shown that such derivations fail to account for the complex structure of the clustering problem and therefore provide no performance information [13]. Here, we derive the min-cut algorithm, such that it allows clustering over large numbers of variables, by using a theoretical model for the min-cut algorithm. This derivation allows us to verify, through numerical simulations, min-cut's performance on the set of problem sets which comprise the Minibatch benchmarking test set.\n\n[Bibtex]\n\n@inproceedings{davisson2015mincut, author = {Eric Davisson}\n\n1. Introduction Minibatch is one of the more interesting benchmarking tests. It is a set of problems on which algorithms can be run in short intervals of time on a machine with a sufficient number of CPUs and memory (1000 CPUs/250GB). The goal of Minibatch is to give an evaluation metric for the computational efficiency of such algorithms. For example, algorithms can be run on Minibatch problems, in which they receive the problem set on one line and they have their performance evaluated on the next line of data. The number of minibatch problems also plays a role to a few degree in the performance evaluation. It has been shown by Friese [10] that minibatch problems can be computed in approximately 5 seconds for 1000 CPUs on a Windows machine. In contrast, a typical task running on a single processor can take tens of seconds to solve. A number of problems which are",
    "1. Introduction\n\nThe Fusing-Vertical-Horizontal Convolutions (FVRH) network (Bruijn and van Haarsma) allows for the transformation of two separate video signals (horizontal slice and vertical slice) into a single, unified one (FVRH-vertex). This network is designed to reduce the bandwidth requirement by combining the horizontal and vertical portions of an encoded video signal. This feature enables transmission of several channels via a low-cost communication channel. Moreover, the current implementation on the GPU is not intended to be used for encoding (i.e., only for decoding) but as a learning component for the network prior to encoding. The following is the abstract of our paper:\n\n1.1 General\n\nThe image segmentation task is used for training the FVRH-vertex network. The task is to find a feature-detection method that will predict a pixel in the image with the highest signal-to-noise ratio. For two-way classification, the best feature detector should be chosen after averaging the predictions. The current task is trained manually via the CIFAR10 training set, from which a subset of the training data (representing the top 5%, bottom 3%, median, 20.8%, 25 and median pixels) are reused in the network to reach a performance of 97% for the two-way classification task. The current implementation is trained via the same data subset used for the two-way classification task. The current implementation aims to use a fully-connected network topology and has three hidden layers to enable non-linearity.\n\n1.1.1 Model\n\nIn the current model, a layer is split to four regions (Figure 1). The first region is the baseline region consisting of the first 3 regions selected via a kernel search. The second region is composed of the last 3 regions chosen. The third region is the target region. The current region's connections and their weights are derived from the CIFAR10 training data. Since the performance in this task is not that great, a simpler implementation will be used on the GPU instead of the CPU.\n\nFigure 1: Layer structure for the current model.\n\n1.1.2 Feature Detection\n\nFor",
    "Gross-Pitaevskii type [1]\n\nSolitons in a hard-core bosonic system\n\nThe Gross-Pitaevskii type [2] (also known as the Hodge-podge or the topo-electric) is defined as a supersymmetric topological boson with a topological topology as described in my previous answer. It is a one-dimensional system with a finite volume. If a bosonic system is bosonic or bosonic-to-bosonic (Bb)/bosonic at all of its subspaces then our topological boson has the Gross-Pitaevskii type.\n\nSolitons in bosonic bosonic systems generally have a finite volume. Since an infinite volume would contradict our original picture of a bosonic boson (see below)[3], we will leave it as an open question as to whether a finite volume is still a suitable topological property of our boson.\n\nFor simplicity we will consider two-dimensional spin-1/2 bosons. But to the best of our knowledge we are unaware of any other bosons that satisfy this condition.\n\nIn order to prove that gross-pitaevskii type occurs as a topological property in bosonic bosonic systems, we first need to understand its fundamental mathematical definition.\n\nThe number three is of special importance when it comes to the Gross-Pitaevskii number. For the simple case of pure bosonic systems we will define the Gross-Pitaevskii number to be equal to the number of possible spins on a unit square.\n\nAs we will see below, this leads to the following conjecture: if the Gross-Pitaevskii number is equal to 3, then everything is three-dimensional.\n\nTheorem 1 The Gross-Pitaevskii number is equal to 3.\n\nThe Gross-Pitaevskii number is defined here, in a sense, with respect to spin (which we denote by c) and unit square. Specifically, the Gross property says that if you can rotate any element of the unit square around a fixed, positive x axis, then you can rotate the element back again.\n\nIf you can",
    "Observations of an EXO-200 background in radioactive rock obtained from the Mt. Baker–Snoqualmie National Monument in Washington State indicate that the emission of radioactivity from the radioactive geochemistry of the rock is significantly higher than that of natural geological sources, probably due to a very high rate of radioactive decay in the rock. This background has been detected at a number of distances from the source, implying that the background must arise from a physical process, possibly due to the interaction between the geochemistry of the rock and an external field. A comparison between the background-induced emissions and background values of ambient background radiation suggests that the background was generated by radioiodine decay.\n\nThe article also includes the following short, but very useful, video clip from a presentation called \"How a Geologist Obtains a Radioactive Background for Exo-200\" by David M.

    "Kac-Moody Extensions to 3-Arrays and M2-Branes\n\nThis paper extends the concept of the Kac-Moody extension of an M2-brane to the Kac-Moody extensions of 3-arrays, and Kac-Moody Extensions to 3-polygroups. I propose several examples where the Kac-Moody extensions are applicable. The paper starts from a fundamental theorem on M2-branes by W. Kac. A Kac-Moody extension is a way to convert M2-branes into Kac-Moody 3-polybranes in the form of higher-dimensional extensions of the original M2-brane. This is of course only slightly different from the notion in which a topological 3-polymorphism from the Kac-Moody 3-polymorphism group in the Kac-Moody 2-shell (a group with a finite set of objects) from the standard Kac-Moody 2-shell on the monoid of M2-modules can be converted to a Kac-Moody 3-polymorphism on the monoid of Kac-Moody 2-modules in the Kac-Moody 2-shell. In this paper the concept of an M2-polymorphism is not applied directly to monoidal 3-polymorphism groups, but is used to model the 3-branes of the Kac-Moody extensions through a slightly different definition, one that does not lead to a \"3-polymorphism extension to 3-branes\" or to an \"3-algebras extension to Kac-Moody extensions\" in the Kac-Moody 2-shell.\n\nThe Kac-Moody extension can be applied to any 2-kernel, although the usual example is monoidal ones. The most important example I like to use is the 3-core of a 4-algebra (a ring of 3-modules). Here I argue that the 3-algebra of the Kac-Moody extension in particular allows us to compute the quotients of 3-fold groups over 3-core spaces",
    "Abstract:\n\nWe study the mass growth of objects as a result of their categorization, finding that it is not simply the result of the entropy increase due to the larger size of the objects. The rise in size leads to a greater mass that is further driven up by further categorization, which in turn leads to an increasingly large number of objects.\n\n\nIn this article, we will explore a number of important applications of this phenomena, using as examples the distribution of atoms in a gas and the mass density in a star, which are both dominated by a single object. We illustrate three main phenomena that lead to this general pattern: the expansion of the universe from a hot Big Bang; the growth of galaxies; and the emergence of objects in the universe. We argue that this mass increase is not fundamentally random in nature. One possibility is that all objects that contain enough mass, as opposed to an excess quantity of the kind we observe, will eventually emerge without any help from a random process. In the latter case, the result is an evolution through a series of processes that is governed by well-defined statistical laws.\n\n\nWe discuss the implications of this notion for the study of the universe and specifically for the search for dark matter or dark energy.",
    "The computational complexity of dynamic programming has received renewed attention over the last few years, with recent work from E.T. Brown and I.Y. Korn as well as recent work focusing on the efficiency of linear programming. We study cascade products of answer sets that satisfy three properties: (1) they reduce to recursively defined linear programs (linear regression or linear regression trees) for any value of parameters, (2) they do so for any real number as long as the sequence of variables is bounded, and (3) the shortest path between two given nodes is the shortest path among all solutions given to a constraint. Our model is built around a recast version of a classical Turing Machine that implements answer-set programming with two additional operations.\n\nI wrote that to illustrate how it isn't enough to use the right tools to the best of your ability - instead, you need to be able to reason about the whole problem space, not just the small area covered by how one tool is used.

    "Direct white matter bundle Segmentation using Stacked U-Nets\n\nWe report a method of segmenting and identifying white matter networks using stacked (or multi-layer) microtubules. We derive the concept of a stack by combining the structural and mechanical properties of microtubules, and apply this to tractography. We apply the method to segment 3D-printed brain subjects and show the resulting data can be reliably classified into anatomical networks. The resulting segmentation accuracy ranges from 66% to 84%, suggesting a high degree of tractability. To further validate the technique, we applied the method to two individual subjects who have been reported to have a rare variation in microtubule distribution which makes them unique. We then applied the technique to more than thirty subjects with other microtubule distributions, and the overall accuracy increased from 74% to 83%. The method is scalable to large numbers of subjects and enables an improved segmentation performance than previously reported.\n\nFor more on this project and similar work, please watch the following videos from TEDxMaine.com.\n\nVia The Huffington Post",

    "Context\n\nThe human visual system is typically very good at face and skin recognition, but is not nearly as good at object detection. In general, face detection and object detection are computationally expensive, and the cost can be substantial. Several groups have studied various approaches for boosting the performance of face detection, and we have recently reported an approach that uses local prior knowledge to guide training to better match a user's visual data. A more generally applicable class of models that exploit prior knowledge on object detection can be used to improve the accuracy at object and face detection, at the cost of increasing computational burden on existing large scale data-mining systems. Previous work shows that these prior-guided models can significantly improve detection performance. However, due to the complexity of the problem, it is unclear what level of prior knowledge or model complexity is required to achieve these improvements and how to design a model that efficiently learns to generalize to new data to achieve the improvements. In this paper we propose a model which uses local models on an image pre-trained on a large number of images. We show that this local representation performs better than conventional prior-guided models on both face and object detection. By combining the ability to exploit local knowledge with strong local learning we provide a robust solution for tackling data-hungry image segmentation. Our model achieves over 20X improvement across the two target classes, which enables accurate object detection without further training (see Figure 3). We compare several ways to improve the performance of our local prior-guidance, including using a more fine-grained prior to determine the image properties. This is shown in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 2. Perceptual Prior Prediction with Deep Belief Nets on Face Detection. The deep belief nets are used for prediction on faces using a fine-grained perceptual prior at layer 2. The network is trained for face detection (top left), skin detection (top right) and object detection (bottom left). The resulting network is then used to improve the performance compared against the original network (top right). This is a good example of how a strong prior can be used to improve the performances when the prior is fine-grained. Full size image\n\nFigure 3. Deep Prior-Guided Local Models.

    "\"A 3D Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation\n\nAn efficient and robust algorithm for segmentation is needed to improve the accuracy of the segmentation used in the medical field. The present paper describes an algorithm called MSE-D, or Micro-Spatial Separation-and-Identification. MSE-D can obtain a decent quality image with minimal effort from a low-end computer device. As a result, MSE-D is potentially a feasible, feasible technology for medical diagnosis and treatment to come.\n\nImage Classification in Medical Applications\n\nThe human body is an extremely complex biological system as it has its own biological composition, its own unique patterns of motion, coloration, surface anatomy, and many different types of injuries, defects, and diseases. It can be very challenging for automated medical diagnosis, and even for machine-learning system like MSE-D to extract reliable segmentation on a large scale (such as a whole brain).\n\nMSE-D in Depth\n\nMSE-D is a spatial (Coarse-to-Fine) separation and identification algorithm, which makes it different from current techniques. The current models to segment the image are either based on (1) the distance of each feature over a particular pixel, (2) pixel size, (3) a spatial threshold, or one of the 3 aforementioned methods combined with some form of localization.\n\nThe underlying concept of MSE-D is to extract the minimum distance between the feature and the pixel at feature detection time. Then with these distances extracted we obtain a global average pixel coordinate, then the feature is isolated using the threshold. This gives us maximum segmentation accuracy which is necessary for a high-efficiency segmentation.\n\nThe basic idea behind extracting minimum distances is that in a multi-domain environment, such an algorithm will minimize the error in finding the boundary between two domains during the segmentation. On the other hand, a model in which the minimum distance for each feature is fixed is similar to the method that is usually used for detecting low-level artifacts in the images produced by imaging techniques. Another similarity is that the results obtained by different algorithms will be slightly different, though the results obtained from MSE-D are much better than the other",
    "Homology cycles in a locally standard torus action on the manifold {N, M} can be obtained based on the theory of a generic homology group with the action of local torus action on the M × N bundle. The corresponding homology cycle is called a \"homogeneous homology group\" or \"homogenous torus\". These generalizations were developed in a recent work in which a new class of homogeneous (i.e., homogeneous torus) torus actions was developed. In the paper, we develop the homogeneous homology of the action over the vector bundle {u}, with several extensions.\n\nAn excerpt from the abstract:\n\nWe treat the torus action (that of local torus and curvature) of a regular surface. If we imagine that a uniform 2D surface \\(S\\) at point (0, 0) is connected to a local torus at point (w, w) we can write $${\\bf F_S}}={\\bf F_{S}^{\\prime} }\\cdot{u\\mathbf Y};$$ where \\({\\bf F_S \\}\\) is the locally orthogonal tensor to the space \\([S,w],{\\bf F_S} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^4 \\). The result can be interpreted as the homogeneous homology of the action on the space $${u\\mathbf Y}$$ consisting of locally orthogonal tensor products over \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\). In other words for every point \\((0,0)\\) this action defines a surface function \\(P = \\mathbf{u}^{T}_0P\\) with non-zero coefficients, connected to \\(\\mathbf{u}^{T}_0\\) via the regular torus action at point \\(w, w\\).\n\nThe paper can be found in the arxiv for the link here.\n\nThe link is also a PDF where the PDF of the paper is also located.

    "We report here that a neural oscillator (NER) based on a nonlinear dynamical system is capable of transitioning through a diverse set of states that are characterized by the relative excitability of each neuron. The transitions are characterized in terms of the temporal rate of transients and their average amplitude (the transition constant), which are, in general, related to the frequency of the excitant. An effective modulation of the excitability of a single neuron using a nonlinear neuron can result in a wide range of nonlinear dynamics of the nervous system. In the most relaxed state there is a highly compact neuron configuration that has low average excitability and low transition frequency. In this model, the excitatory input is provided only to neurons with high excitability and high switch frequency. As the transition frequency increases, the number of \"excitatory synapses\" increases, and the average excitability of the population increases. Finally, the input signal is filtered so as to filter out the excitant so as to increase the average frequency of the transitions. The resulting neuron configuration has low average excitability but high transition frequency, and the dynamics are nonlinear. If a voltage is applied in this initial condition, the neuron's output state is a nonlinear state that is characterized by low average excitability and high transition frequency (see figure 1a; inset). The state transitions of this nonlinear neuron are characterized by two classes of excitatory synapses: (1) transient excitatory synapses and (2) long-term excitatory synapses. The transient excitatory synapses are characterized by a large, linear, phase-locking population of excitatory synapses with low phase locking, while the large-scale, long-term excitatory synapses are characterized by highly compact oscillatory configurations that are characterized by low coupling and slow transition, with the number of these synapses increasing from very few to several thousands. The model of the transient neurons and their excitatory connections is characterized by a number of parameters: the transition frequency and the excitatory threshold frequency, the coupling constant (c) and the coupling constant ratio, the number of excitatory synapses and the number of nonlinear neurons: the number of excitatory synapses and the number of nonlinear neurons are controlled by (1) different parameters for both",
    "Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation through Dual-task Consistency\n\nWe have developed a novel method to predict the human state in medical images after each image is segmented for classification. We show performance of a new deep convolutional neural network architecture that enables us to perform both single-task and dual-task segmentation in medical images to assess the accuracy of a given model, the number of images needed for a given model and the impact of training on the amount of time to train the new model. Our research on medical image segmentation, a subfield of deep learning and machine learning, focuses on the challenges presented both by changing algorithms and the changing complexity of medical image analysis. For example, some algorithmically simple tasks such as thresholding and feature extraction become exponentially more difficult when the number of classes grows, as do tasks like identifying medical images among other medical images or identifying images from a continuous pool of similar images. In contrast, some of the most recent deep learning models attempt to solve large-scale image segmentation problems with simpler features, but such methods do not address the complex task of finding the right regions in medical images. We propose a novel method, dual-task consistency, that can be used to improve the performance of both single-task or dual task-based segmentation. Our framework works in two sequential steps: (1) our model performs single-task segmentation, finding regions of interest based on the input image while tracking the target image in a continuous learning loop; (2) we re-train the model by running the segmentation task over a pool of previously obtained images, and the final output of this process is the new model's final state for the dual-task task. We provide a detailed computational simulation and demonstrate the dual-task consistency approach on several real-world medical image applications at the individual class level with more detailed simulation on a large medical image dataset at the global level using an advanced neural network architecture.\n\nSee the video below to witness the Dual-task Consistency architecture in action:\n\nThe above video is from a paper titled The Dual-Tail-Threshold Design of Large-Scale Medical Image Segmentation Models by Cui, Y., Gao, X., Feng, Z., Chen, M., Gao, Y.,",
    "Research Paper\n\nNeutro-Connectedness Cut: a Novel Network Interaction Technique for Distributed Graph Estimation\n\nAbstracts | Presentation | Abstracts | Presentation with video\n\nTo create distributed graphs, the network connections (i,j) of a graph must be known in some way. There are many existing techniques for computing the connections between objects (such as nodes, edges, or regions) in distributed graphs, such as the Graph-Based Graph Analyser (GBGA). However, most of these techniques are inefficient for large graphs with numerous connections, where these relationships are often strongly ordered (and, therefore, not dependent on the input). Further, to construct a network of such graphs efficiently requires a huge amount of computing power, especially when the graph is generated by GPU. However, if two or more players have similar graphs, these existing methods may not be sufficient, and the network computation may therefore be overly large and thus unecessary. Therefore, we propose a novel technique, called the Neutro-Connectedness Cut, for efficiently constructing such graphs. The algorithm exploits the connection structure between nodes in the nodes of a graph by computing the Neutro-Connectedness Cut (NC) between those nodes. More precisely, the algorithm starts computing the NC of the edges of a large graph consisting of several nodes connected by several edges from the center. Then, given the graph, compute the NC of the edges of the center node.\n\nIn this work, we have developed the following novel technique for distributed graphs:\n\nThe Neutro-Connectedness Cut (NC) generates a graph by cutting it down to the shortest distance on each of the edges (i -> j). This makes the shortest path length of the graph more predictable (i.e. the distance from the center node to any other node will be more predictable than its length). This predictability of the center node's connection length is known as NC. As more and more players join the graph, the average distance between the center node and every other player goes down, making the NC more predictable.\n\nUsing this technique, we obtained a very large and accurate network of players using over 4 million players on PlayStation 4, all playing the game \"Minecraft,\" from the beginning. In particular, we were able to establish accurate, highly connected",

    "Recurrent Networks (NNs) have been successfully used to understand many other real-world problems like object detection in video images. To date, however, these networks are not able to reliably infer semantic structures across large video datasets. For example, a popular model used by the open-access Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) [9] that is commonly used in image classification and object detection algorithms, was built using a simple, fast convolutional recurrent network. We demonstrate that a more complex version of this network with the right structure can achieve surprisingly good performance for video segmentation, but with more complex requirements on network parameters and on the training setup. We discuss the results of our work in several applications that support human language comprehension or object detection related models that require more sophisticated features, and we give a concrete understanding of what needs to be addressed by further research. We highlight the potential of recurrent networks for video segmentation models and provide recommendations on how to improve performance.\n\nThe paper is here (PDF). I have added some comments that I had about the paper and some of the other related papers in the link below. I think that this is a powerful demonstration of the promise of NNs and the ability to use NNs with much more sophisticated output.\n\n[10] The following is a quote from the abstract: \"Video segmentation refers to the ability to identify salient features of a video (i.e., locations) without requiring knowledge of the scenes present.\"\n\n[11] I think it is helpful to point out that this paper describes a system whose goal has been to analyze a scene from a video frame by frame, not to analyze a stream of bytes. In order to make sure that the input stream is the same, a small difference in pixel positions need not be considered problematic, as this is already performed by the decoder. The NNs used in this paper are relatively simple, but not simple enough, in my opinion. A single convolutional layer must perform a much more complicated job, but we need a few layers of convolutions just to be able to do this job effectively. A real-life example of this kind of problem is that of color discrimination or recognition.\n\n[12] This paper also describes NNs that are able to process and characterize arbitrary images in different ways (e",
    "This manuscript investigates the relationship between power-law distribution and the distribution of time spent in a computer room (PC). A typical task of the study is to visualize the distribution of power law distribution of time spent in a room by graphing the data at 10, 20, and 50 second exposure. The results show that the power-law graph has a higher resolution and a wider power distribution than the average distribution. Furthermore, this effect persists for increasing values of exposure time and increases with higher exposure times. Further analyses show that by introducing the term \"noise\" into the original analysis the power law graph seems to have its own peculiarities that distinguish from the average distribution of noiseless PCs.\n\nThis topic has been written up in a number of papers on arxiv, including:\n\nAbstract from Novell and Dyer, 2015\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1510.0968\n\nAbstract from Novell and Dyer, 2015, http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.0349\n\nAbstract from Novell and Dyer, 2015 \"Modeling PC use with noise and power-law graphs\"\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1510.0969\n\nAbstract from Novell and Dyer, 2015, http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.0970\n\nAbstract from Novell and Dyer, 2015, https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.0898\n\nAbstract from Novell and Dyer, 2015, http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.0972\n\nAnd a review: Power-law vs. average: A new approach to studying distribution and variability in distributed systems research\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1505.0034\n\nAnd this page of papers includes:\n\nAbstract for Power-Law Graph Cuts\n\nAnd here are some papers that show the power of applying \"power-law\" analysis to a variety of domains.",
    "The image segmentation task is characterized by fast, long-range, and powerful feature extraction approaches. These have been achieved with large datasets by applying image segmentation methods and neural networks. We suggest to use the deep convolutional networks for short-range, weakly supervised image segmentation, and to use the fast, short-range, and non-linear SVM for long-range strong supervised image segmentation. We proposed techniques for boosting the quality of the SVM. In particular, we consider a two-stage approach for training and evaluation: first preprocessing the data, then training the classifier using cross validation and then evaluation (evaluation step is omitted because they were included in the previous discussion). Training is performed by training an SVM using the feature maps produced by the training data on the unsupervised training data. Evaluation is performed over the classifier trained with the cross-validated training data. In order to enable cross validation over the trained classifier we introduce a new feature, the context. Training over the first phase is performed at the end of epochs 0 (the beginning of training), 1 and 2 of training where each epoch is 4 hours. In the evaluation phase we use the cross-validated training data. In this scheme, the total number of epochs is 50. By using preprocessing we achieve a mean of 0.85 epoch and a standard deviation of 0.26 epoch. We propose an efficient linear classification model for the classification of images using a deep convolutional network and an effective non-linear features mapping.",
    "This paper presents the asymptotic expansion of partition functions that represent possible distributions over the distribution-complete graph. Among the first important applications can be found the representation of the distribution-complete graphs of two-body systems. There is a well known problem in approximation theory of a two-body system corresponding to the sum of the partial derivatives. The partition function that gives the value of this sum gives a nice estimate of the time required for a partial derivative. But that estimate is very insensitive to the value of the partial derivative. We show that if the distribution in the system is distributed with a partition function that is related to the sinh-model for a uniform hyperbolic sphere, the asymptotic expansion gives a good estimate of the time for a sinh-modelled partial derivative on such a distribution.\n\nThe paper also discusses the theoretical work by Witten and Mössbauer, and shows that, although the Witten/Mössbauer paper had good empirical results, the theoretical calculations had much more freedom to be more precise.\n\nSo…what does this all mean? Well, it seems that the work by Witten and Mössbauer is much more rigorous than we've previously seen, even when the theory is more simple than it initially appeared. While this means that it is much easier to understand the work using the more complex form of the underlying problem that Witten and Mössbauer used, the simpler result does make sense: it's much easier to deal with incomplete data if we ignore the large \"uncertainty\" that the more precise theory might have.\n\nAlso, even if I don't have an easy answer, I think it's interesting that a mathematical analysis of our current understanding of statistics in the area of distributions can be done without actually using sampling in the traditional sense. I think many people reading this can relate this to the fact that the \"big data\" that we continue to rely on has an inherent uncertainty built into it, in terms of the statistical methods that we use to cope with it. The more formal solution Witten and Mössbauer have to this uncertainty is one that I would find interesting.\n\nNow, how do the results compare to the work Witten and Mössbauer used to perform their statistical",
    "We present a novel image processing and detection method based on neural networks which can be used to classify the edges in a picture efficiently. Our approach provides the following benefits: (a) a highly efficient approach in capturing the edges, including all the pixels that are not touching the background; (b) an algorithm that is simple and easy to implement and operate; and (c) very high accuracy.\n\n\nOur approach relies on a highly accurate neural network trained to classify edges in a scene by exploiting its feature correlation function. This is done with the use of a combination of convolution and annealing techniques from deep image processing. It achieves a state-of-the-art performance for edge detection in a picture with an image size of 32×32 pixels. Based on our method a picture of 6×6 pixels or 4×4 pixels can be efficiently detected with a mere 16 lines of convolution, and it may be done in less than a second. In case of both the size of the picture and low computation power image recognition for smaller pictures becomes rather difficult.\n\n\nOur approach uses the neural network parameters from two commonly used approaches in object detection: the standard and the deep convolutional neural network. In both they consider the image as a function of feature values and a small amount of additional information added to detect edges in the pictures. Thus the neural network provides a highly accurate method in classification, and we propose an algorithm that takes advantage of this accuracy.",

    "The flooding of natural systems is a fundamental concept in environmental science. The ability to form these networks is one of the most intriguing properties of biology. However, whether flood-filling can actually occur in natural systems is not well understood. Here, we present a novel model for flood-filling networks in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Two ANNs, one with hidden neurons and another with convolutional neural networks, can automatically form flood-filling nets for arbitrary datasets. Our models can take as input a simple population of simple populations. By constructing a high-order representation from two representations, respectively convolutional and softmax, we obtain a network that efficiently compresses and fills data. This is an important tool for studying the emergence of biologically relevant functions in natural systems. …",

So if you know some point in the graph, this means that you have something to connect that to the scene. It seems that the style graph is really like a language based representation for the picture. The idea, in principle, would be to use some of the main language features to learn the language of style. For example, a color classifier for the picture with the same color palette would learn the color representations used for the picture and use them to extract the style features. I'm not sure if this would work in practice, though, and with the current results, it is difficult to be comfortable even seeing the style diagram",

    "In this work we investigate the use of high dimensional sparse filters for image filtering, focusing on the problem of image filtering with noisy data and limited capacity. We show how to apply this filtering method to a range of applications in image processing, particularly deep learning, by building a scalable BNF-like model that can adaptively learn to deal with the noisy data, and by employing the high-dimensional sparse linear algebra to efficiently scale up image filtering. Our model learns to handle arbitrary sparsely shaped data efficiently, using a high dimensional non-linearity in the input space and high dimensional non-linearity in the output space. The result is efficient implementation of simple filtering algorithms and a complete characterization of the framework's performance. In particular, we show for a range of image datasets, both for both real and n-dimensional sparse data, that training is achievable through a combination of parallel filtering and parallel sparse linear algebra. Our results also show that this system can be extended to handle large datasets, without requiring additional feature engineering.\n\nWe demonstrate two main results. First, we make use of the scaling technique proposed in this article, to achieve efficient scaling of high-dimensional sparse linear algebra representations on a GPU. Second, our framework can also provide an alternative form of feature engineering that allows the model to learn to do a variety of filtering tasks, such as bilinear filtering, soft and hard soft-edge detection, and fuzzy feature engineering.\n\nThe video gives a good description of the research, showing a few examples of both the parallel and the parallel sparse linear algebra pipelines.\n\nI want to thank Paul Chudnovsky and Ben DeZeeuw for helpful discussions, and I would like to extend a huge thank you to Alex Graves and his folks at Deep Learning Systems for making this work possible.

    "Introduction Some aspects of the theory of automorphisms in cohomology theory are important. For instance, the automorphisms of a particular homogeneous curve in a cohomology group form a cohomology space with a certain property, which may be useful in the theory of groups. In this paper we consider a new form of the automorphism group on curves, whose automorphisms consist of curves of an arbitrary rank, namely those which are a product of an algebroject and a finite automorphism class such that, for all,,, such that. However, what we are interested in is the automorphism group on curves, where the topology of is arbitrary as in a typical representation of, and not necessarily compact as in the general representation of, where. Specifically, the automorphism group of such curves forms the generalization of the group on a point, where. On a curve we suppose for a point. Let us think of an isomorphism (in the sense of the group ) in the category of finite groups. In this paper we give an algorithm for the definition of such isomorphisms, and show that there exists such an isomorphism among two curves of rank, that is, such that there is a family of automorphisms and such that for all. We also give a definition for non-commutative rings in a cohomology group of curves, and prove that this ring has an isomorphism of group automorphisms, i.e., between all automorphisms in a cohomology group of curves. As a result, we obtain the statement about the automorphism group on curves. The following results in the theory of automorphisms in cohomology theory are obtained by applying the method of automorphisms.

    "Aseptically, skin lesions are known as epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Although more than 50% of the phenotypic variations of EB are due to genetic factors, there are exceptions where these genetic factors are either negligible or cannot be explained by them (1, 2). These exceptions include an increase of pigmentation in a portion of the population; some melanin phenotypes have no genetic variants and are thus called trichromacy; and a specific decrease of collagen type I (3, 4).\n\nWe have developed an approach to infer the genetic basis of pigmentation in EB by using annotations of skin lesions in the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Disease Biospecimen Bank (DBB). To that end, we applied the same classification and classification inference methods used in previous studies (5, 6) to an NHGRI skin lesion gene set (7). It should be noted that skin lesions are more prevalent in darker races (8), thus leading to the expectation that they could be a source of genome-wide information regarding the origin of melanogenesis. Our analysis of these annotations reveals that they do not distinguish strongly between the three different skin lesion types: it is unclear if EB is caused by melanogenesis defects or by other causes. Thus, a major challenge for the future is to devise a new classification model for melanogenic disorders for use in the context of more widespread genotyping (9).",
    "We propose a probabilistic model of heavy-tailed events for detecting patterns in time and space. It is a type of PLL (plasticity–lognormal) model with the following two parameters:\n\nThe coefficient of proportionality\n\nThe probability distribution\n\nWe consider six samples from a random sample of 1 billion samples. We show that the heavy-tailed event is likely to occur on any of the six samples, with a very high probability that it occurs at random. Therefore, the event is more probable than a true random event.\n\nThere's one catch here. In real life, with millions of possibilities, it's likely that some other pattern or probability is going to appear on any of these six samples. However, the model is going to tell you that this has never happened, because it is much more probable for any of the six samples to have the heavy-tailed event than for any one of the samples to have no heavy tails.\n\nThe idea of the light-tailed (not PLL) model of heavy-tailed events for detecting patterns comes from Daniel Eilenberg, who found that a very large proportion of the time, he got very similar predictions for heavy tails from different probabilistic models. This led him to conclude that some model did well at predicting heavy tail events while all other models were terrible at it. The best model that was statistically \"in between\" did worse than the other models.\n\nThe models (and also the PLL model) are consistent when a few samples occur, but when many samples occur, the two models diverge. We believe that there's a causal link between the difference in convergence of such two models and the difficulty of predicting heavy tails.\n\nA note on the title of the paper: \"Pinning Model with Heavy Tailed Disorder\" comes from the idea behind the study (which doesn't really apply to all cases, but still applies quite well to them), but it's the name of a toy toy game. You can also call it a \"toy\" game that requires some mathematics in general.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Bitcoin price analysis?\n\nBitcoin price analysis is a game of making guesses with the amount of Bitcoins you have. It's not like poker where you are guessing if someone is likely to spend your Bitcoins. At best,",
    "We study a new class of three-manifold symmetries in dimer algebras. Our results confirm the strong relationship between these local symmetries and two-manifold structures, confirming the existence of dimerization geometries. In addition, we show that these symmetries correspond to quantum number-theoretical results, and that this fact can be exploited to build simple three-dimensional nonlocality machines. Given a three-dimensional unitary algebra with a dimerization, one will find the following: the topology will be 3-manifold, the topology of the two- and the one-body is 3-manifold and the topology of the dimerization is 3-manifold. These are the three local symmetries. Moreover, we prove that the two local symmetries are differentiable and that the one-body is 3-manifold.\n\nThis paper is the latest in a long string of scientific papers that have come out about nonlocality in particle physics, particularly in black hole information collapse, and I highly recommend reading the full series of links that I've compiled here.",
    "Abstract Given a set of n randomized samples and a kernel function that maps the sampled data to the space of tuples, a k-means clustering algorithm is proposed for the ISIC 2017 Skin lesion segmentation challenge. A cluster of k samples is generated by k*k-1 independent and distinct clusters. This algorithm uses an ensemble of k subsets of subsets of subsets of sampled data generated by k subsets of subsets of subsets. The k*k-1 clusters (corresponding to the unique values) partition the sample space according to their distance from the k-0 original samples. The distance between each sample and the origin is minimized.\n\nA k-means clustering algorithm for the ISIC 2017 Skin lesion segmentation challenge was also presented at the ISIC Workshop on Information Segmentation and Segmentation.

    "Introduction\n\nQuantitative cw (QCD) (1) is a method for the rapid determination/characterization of the covalent bond network during the growth of the hydration layer (2).\n\nQuantitative cw has been used successfully in high-throughput chemical analysis of numerous polysaccharides by means of high-resolution QCD imaging and tandem MS (3). Quantitative cw has also been successfully employed in the determination of the free energy of polymerization (4, 5) and for the determination of (6) and (7) tetrahedral bonds in N-acylated polysaccharides. Quantitative cw is also an attractive technique for the determination of the kinetics of hydration/crystallization during macromolecular crosslinking and macropolymeric conformations (8, 9). For such applications, QCD imaging is used. QCD images provide not only the chemical and biochemical features, but also the chemical properties: the orientation of the nucleophilic site along a bond cleavage axis. In addition, because a QCD signal changes with molecular position, it gives insight into the interrelation and dynamics of the polymer chains.\n\nIn this study, we have explored the application of quantitative cw for the assessment of hydrating covalently linked hydrodynamic components like N-acylated poly(acrylic acid). We use a series of in silico (10) computations to test whether the use of quantitative cw has any value.\n\nResults\n\nAims: We study the application of quantitative cw for the assessment of the hydration of N-acylated poly(acrylic acid) polymers to determine which components are hydrated and how hydration occurs.

We apply quantitative cw to the N-acylated polymers to see how N-acylated polymers form and how this changes as a function of pH.\n\nProcedure: N = 4 (poly(acrylic acid) polymer),",
    "\"We show that for the first time, self-maintaining defects can be generated from two interacting Bose-Einstein condensates.

Self-maintaining droplets with different phase morphs are then generated in an artificial medium of different density layers and thermal properties.

    "The task of building robust controllers for an infinite-length system that exhibits a large number of finite linear systems is a common research topic in computational geometric and statistical theory. One example system is a finite dimensional, linear system where all the linear components exhibit a positive-definite density. An approach of this kind provides a solid foundation for the generation of controllers for a wide range of linear systems, but may have a major advantage: it does not require a large numerical model of the system. In this paper we develop a framework that is capable of solving and modeling a finite linear system with infinite-dimensional components. It is based on the following observations:\n\n- the solution of the two noncommutative equations for any particular linear system is not the same in any two reference frames. In other words, the solutions of the nonlinear equations are linearly dependent.\n\n- the solutions of most of the linear equations for any particular linear system are not necessarily independent of another system. These are known as orthagonal equations.\n\n- as systems come into contact at arbitrarily close distances, in a large system the interactions become nonlinearly dependent. These include contact matrices and contacts between systems of systems.\n\n- the solutions of many of the linear equations are not symmetrized. These are known as asymmetric equations.\n\nThe framework of the present work (which we refer to as the Zero Iterated Finite Linear System with Infinite-Dimensional Components), is a generalization of the framework of the work on finite dimensional systems. Unlike the finite dimensional approach, the framework here allows the implementation of a fully deterministic controller that is based on a finite linear system with infinitely many systems.\n\nIn addition to solving the zero-order linear system equations, the framework here is able to handle partial differential equations, partial differential systems, and general problems in linear systems.",
    "Abstract The paper provides a novel approach to real-time pricing using auctioning in the power grids. The two methods discussed in the paper are: A) Dynamic bidding with bid manipulation, and B) linear-function submission auction with bid manipulation. The approach uses two kinds of auction: A) dynamic bidding (i.e., a bid based on an incoming market conditions) and B) bid manipulation (i.e., a bid to make the lowest bid available on the market in a given time window). The approach is demonstrated on a typical regional consumer electricity network as well as on another energy-related area of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. The first part of the paper focuses on the dynamic bidding auction, the second on the bid manipulation auction. The approach is tested in a market of three regions: A) Igreja, one of Brazil's main hydroelectric centers\nB) Bahia, one of Brazil's biggest industrial centers, and\nC) Mato Grosso, a center with substantial mineral resources and\nan emerging producer of meat and dairy. The dynamic bidding auction is established for three days a quarter, and each week the market price is determined using the market prices before and after the auction. The bid manipulation auction is established for three days a quarter and the market price is manipulated within four hours after an announcement of bids. In the dynamic auction, each day the price is calculated using two methods (e.g., arithmetic mean, exponential mean, or exponential median): A) Dynamic arithmetic mean, and B) Dynamic exponential mean. B) Dynamic arithmetic mean was chosen to avoid the problems of overbidding in the bid manipulation auction. B) Dynamic exponential mean is presented to address several issues arising with the dynamic arithmetic mean approach, namely its long time and large space requirements. The dynamic arithmetic mean method gives stable and reliable results using up to 2.8 million simulated data. We also show how auctions based on bid manipulation can bring some of these problems into the domain of realistic bid manipulation auctions, thus making the system more efficient. The approach proposed in this paper can easily be applied to any auction situation, for example to the Brazilian power grid.\nWhat's in it for you?

    "This paper addresses a problem, previously suggested by A. V. Tikhonov and G. Brinch, of the extraction of semantic sub-concepts from raw input streams with no pre-computed feature representations. The proposed technique, dubbed 'light-weight refinenet', is built upon the idea of weight reduction. While the weight reduction described here works across the entire corpus, it was developed for extraction of new semantic sub-concepts from raw streams, for cases in which the semantic sub-concepts are sparse, unstructured (as in the image space), or highly correlated. Specifically, the proposed procedure uses an iterative filter procedure that minimizes (but does not exactly eliminate) the number of hidden units, followed by a supervised learning algorithm that, in conjunction with an empirical comparison of each hidden unit to other hidden units, assigns each hidden unit with respect to the given (and a few additional) weights. We applied the proposed procedure (with the appropriate weights) on a corpus of natural language text. The extracted sub-concepts are then extracted from the text-like samples using a discriminative model.\n\nAbout our paper: the main argument we pursue is that the use of light-weight refinenet results in results that are significantly better than any other possible neural network-based methods for capturing semantic sub-concepts in natural language input. For instance, in a recent benchmark-study we tested various neural network-based techniques (from LSTM to Fully Connected-LSTM) on a corpus of natural language text and discovered that none of those approaches could match the results of light-weight refinenet. Additionally, there is no reason to believe that the proposed method will also not work for other more difficult datasets.\n\nFor more research data that can be used for our dataset, please see: https://github.com/dshs/SemanticSeamless.",

One tape in particular was worth $150,000 (£115,000) at the time. \"You can do very good Elvis on tape today,\" says Peter Davis, who was chairman of the auction in 2003. \"But they're not as good as the originals [because] they were recorded in studios that weren't of the best standard.\" A lot of people have been trying to get these records for years, but most of them have also made other poor quality releases.

    "In another setback to the Ferguson camp, Juventus have revealed today that they will not be signing up Manchester United's expensive starlet Michael Keane by offering €100k (around £85,000) a year.\n\nUnited manager Sir Alex Ferguson revealed to journalists that he was looking to add someone big to his squad, and had targeted the United midfielder to replace Rio Ferdinand. However, Keane is keen to move to the Serie A club AC Milan where he would be reunited with new Milan boss Silvio Piola from his time at Juventus.\n\nThe 26-year-old is being touted by Ferguson as a possible replacement for Rio Ferdinand and is considered one of his best squad players. But now the Old Trafford club are having to rethink that decision, not having any concrete bids received for the Irish international.\n\nIt is understood that Keane's price tag in Italy is €100,000 (£85,000) a year and there are now plans to look at other players who could potentially replace Fergie's preferred option, such as Arsenal midfielder Paul Scholes.\n\nIt should be noted that Milan manager Silvio Piola took a less lavish approach to negotiating his first contract than Ferguson.\n\nPiola, who managed in Italy for over four years with Juventus, made a new deal possible by agreeing a salary of €800,000 (£620,000) a season with the Serie A outfit. However, there have been reports that Ferguson was unwilling to pay £1million for a first-choice coach under the current transfer window rules.\n\nUnited would be liable to pay an initial £8million if they sign Keane but Piola could cut their bill by offering less cash back in the form of incentives.\n\nKeane's future is unclear for the moment but Ferguson would surely rather play him in the United midfield than put his trust in another midfielder, such as a Scholes, and risk him turning out to be less than spectacular.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Sport_Witness\n\nSource: bbc.com\n\nRelated\n\nArticle by Colin Young",
    "Australian households grew by 1.4pc in the year to April, a further sign that the economy is stabilising despite the recent decline in mining investment. But growth in construction, which has fallen for three successive quarters, is falling even faster, pushing annual GDP down 0.5pc from the previous quarter to a four-year low of $220bn. The Australian dollar hit an eight year high of US73.7c, while the trade deficit narrowed by 18pc as imports narrowed, albeit for a slower year-on-year rate. Home values remained solid at an annual 3pc rise, with the property sector pushing the national market.\n\nIn Australia, house prices remain remarkably high. In the past decade or so Australia has seen several cycles of rising house prices with the peak in house prices happening in the mid 2000's. So the increase in house prices in Australia during the past five years has been remarkable.\n\nIn the graph below I have broken down where it came from:\n\nIf you look at the graph that I put up, you'll see that on the high end, prices have doubled since 1997.\n\nSo is the global housing bubble about to burst? It depends on how many bubbles there are, and how fast they erupt. If the world continues down the path of low interest rates and a cheap financial system, then we can expect more bubbles to burst:\n\nWith financial assets only increasing as a percentage of GDP this level is a very stable level. If an investment like the housing sector is driven by a market expectation of future returns and is not being constrained by current economic growth, then this level will only increase, driven by the very low rates of real interest rates.\n\nWe can already see two possible outcomes.\n\nThe first outcome is that investors in houses and other financial assets will start to lose their ability to invest and the bubble will burst. If this occurs people will have a difficult time buying and selling homes using cash savings (in the US you can look at the current average $100,000 down payment required to get into a decent priced house in most regions of the country). That will lead to a dramatic sell off in the market, followed by people withdrawing their cash until prices are under control (just look at the housing market in Australia right now, and many other markets around the world like London, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia) …",
    "Tunisia is still in the grips of a political crisis triggered by the Pernod group, the country's fourth-largest, gaining control of the state oil company through an early takeover bid.\n\nThe state news agency reports that an initial Pernod plan to buy 75 per cent of the company has been revised down to 60 out of 83 shares.\n\nThis is the second time in five months that the government has been forced into a change in its strategy for the company after the Tunisian parliament was in the hands, for eight months, of two parties who had no democratic mandate for control over the national oil company.\n\nBut there was a notable difference to the previous situation.\n\nIt is unclear how quickly the government was able to bring together those two parties to form a government following the Pernod takeover of 75 per cent of the company, despite the lack of democratic mandate.\n\nThe news agency also points out that the \"difference of interests\" between the two parties in the previous situation is still very clear.\n\nSo what has caused this new twist in the political drama?\n\nTunisia is often criticised by other countries in the region for maintaining a bloated government structure that is not responsive to citizens' needs.\n\nAlthough some of the country's politicians are concerned about the economy and unemployment rates, in many cases these problems are being resolved and can be addressed easily through reforms, leaving the government to focus on other areas of its responsibility: infrastructure, education, culture and environmental protection.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, Tunisia's economy has recovered somewhat from its recessionary lows in 2010 and has slowed to a relatively sustainable growth rate of 3.9 per cent for 2015, but the economy remains far from fulfilling Prime Minister Youssef Chahed's objective of achieving five per cent growth by the end of this year.\n\nDespite this, the government continues to emphasise that it will do all it can to protect jobs, but at the same time says that it does not consider itself responsible for the situation.\n\nWhat is clear is that the country is still plagued with protests, including those calling for the ouster of the President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali.\n\nIn addition, the government has launched a plan to address the rising tide of violent crime, which the government acknowledges is a threat which the",
    "New drink limit \"would cut toll\" Police in New York City are calling on the city's mayor to rethink his ban against sugary drinks after one city worker was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. New York City is banning sugary drinks at any place that is open to the public, including bars and restaurants, but it is only taking effect for the month of November and will be on a one-year trial. A 24 hour news show in New York City said the change would cut the number of Type 2 diabetes cases in the city by 75 per cent. But Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said the health benefits to people with the condition will not be seen by December. The mayor's Office of Health and Mental Hygiene is not convinced. Public health officials have long argued that the soda ban will have little effect on diabetes rates. But Professor Richard Lavin, who is from Harvard Medical School and a leading diabetes expert said: \"We do not believe that banning soda drinks from bars at work will have health benefits that outweigh the harm. \"We are calling on the mayor to change course immediately.\" According to the American Diabetes Association, nearly 4.1 per cent of New York City residents have Diabetes Mellitus. The Associated Press said that, among other things, those who live in the city with a high rate of diabetes could feel extra pressure to have diabetes checks. The Associated Press also added that if the soda ban affects people who live in cities where it is easy to go to a grocery store or eat at restaurants, the change can be seen as making poor people more likely to overeat.\n\n\nPlease feel free to add an addition to this section but you can't do that by editing this page from the database.",

A year ago it was priced at £22.10.\n\nVirgin Blue is owned by a private company, BSkyB Ventures, with the American media group Verizon Communications snapping up a 26.8 per cent stake in September.\n\nIn July the telecoms group had agreed to pay £200m for a 26 per cent stake in Virgin Blue, taking its total investment in the company to £410m.

I would expect Virgin blue to go on for many years to come.\"\n\nMr Leggett said Virgin has a great reputation for providing innovative mobile service but the company's expansion plans were hampered by poor pricing – at times Virgin blue was charged as much as £50 more a month than its competitors.\n\nVirgin blue, which offers customers free access to broadband, phones and television services, will be available on an unlimited basis from the end of next week.\"\n\nAdvertisements",

    "EMI shares hit by profit warning as stockmarket falls to new record low\n\nThe news that global shares have fallen more than 3 per cent over the last month and are trading at historic lows is enough to send shivers down the spine of all EMIs, as well as a fair amount of fear. In its latest investor presentation, the French company which does all sorts of businesses from insurance to hotels to distribution centres to food processing company, acknowledged that this was the end of a run of success stories where investors were buying shares thinking they were'safe'. A look below the headline news reveals that the situation is dire. Despite a steady rise in profit in the past years, the share price fell 5 per cent this year and is now at a record low at 14.5p.\n\n'It's the end of a golden period and we are very much aware that the shares of all our businesses are trading at a level that is beyond a normal value,' said the company's chief executive, Emmanuel Petit. 'We are not at the bottom, but the bottom for the financial sector does not look auspicious. We think the whole sector needs a serious reassessment and we are asking our investors to take note.'\n\nThe shares have dropped in the last month largely as a result of poor news on the economy, which has seen the EU referendum result cause a decline in confidence amongst consumers, especially in the UK market. However, the most recent news also appears to have impacted negatively the fortunes of the company's insurance division. Petit said that if the economy continued the way it is going, it was likely that the insurance sector could end the year with a year-on-year loss of around 14 per cent, which would put it in the red for the first time in 20 years. This was confirmed by the recent report on the economy from the Bank of England, which saw it downgraded from'stable' to 'negative'.\n\nEMI will be hoping that the report won't last so long before it has to report earnings. Despite the recent downturn in the share price, shares continued to rise throughout the latter half of 2015 and through the first three quarters of this year, however they have now fallen back to levels lower than they were when they topped the market, over a year ago. It is also worth noting, however, that the decline in the stock price has been mainly",

    "France will ban TV advertisements for junk food on high definition TV screens, a move that could affect a fifth of all TV screens by 2020.\n\nSlimming down TV advertising could mean more choices for consumers, such as less sugar in products and fewer junk foods, the European Commission said yesterday (20 August).\n\nA commission spokeswoman said there are around four times as many programmes playing on television as there are viewers. That means a bigger proportion of people are watching TV with lower definition images, which can be much more visually stimulating.\n\nThe French proposal would make TV programmes which were seen with their original image reduced to a maximum resolution of 720 pixels per inch (ppi) in 25 European countries - the bloc's largest market - exempt from a law covering TV advertising.\n\nSo if someone in Greece watches a programme with a maximum resolution of 720 ppi, that programme will not be affected. Those in Portugal, France, Slovenia, Malta and the UK might be affected, the spokeswoman added.\n\nSugar- and salt-laden products, such as butter crisps, will still be advertised in high definition.\n\nBritain and Ireland will also be given until 2020 to comply with the rule.\n\nThe commission said the decision followed a review of a controversial proposal to reduce the maximum size of screens in Europe while still allowing programmes to be shown in the HD-10 format.\n\nThe new French proposal replaces a draft EU law issued last year that would have imposed an 834 ppi screen size rule.\n\nThe EU said it would consider a more ambitious proposal to allow high definition television to be broadcast in other regions.\n\nA compromise would require all EU member states to follow France's rules, which would mean television programs aired in countries other than France, including the four bigger countries outside the EU's eastern core in the eurozone, would not be subject to the regulation.\n\nThe EU plans to reduce the screens in most of western Europe from 1920 x 1080 pixels (ppi) - standard television quality and the type that most people watch now - as a way of reaching a goal of 30 million more viewers for EU television, by 2020.\n\nThe European Commission estimates that reducing TV advertising will contribute about 10 billion euros ($13 billion) to support production and distribution of fewer adverts for high definition TV screens.",

The Dracula remake has taken a very disappointing $541.6m (£311.7million).\n\nThe Mummy took a massive $668.5m (£326.6m). Of the five films, The Wolfman is the only one not under $500m takings. It made $417m (£284.4m) in 2012.\n\nThe five monster films that have taken £150 million each are Dracula Untold (at No. 1), The Mummy, The Wolfman, Revenge of the Mummy and The Mummy Returns.\n\nMummy franchise is the most financially successful movie franchise, with a combined total of nearly $750m (£460m).\n\nThe four most critically acclaimed films in the history of cinema, are The Return of the King, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Return of the King and The Return of the King remake. They have both grossed more than $1bn (£645m). Those six movies alone have turned an estimated $100bn (£61.7bn) into US movie industry takings.\n\nThe combined total grossing of these six films is a mammoth $1.073 $1.187bn (£852 million).",

But, then again, you have to wonder if even Warren Buffett, arguably one of the world's most brilliant investors, makes the decision to give up on the US dollar anytime soon, since he seems content with sticking with what he has.\n\nHowever, how can we expect the American economy to thrive in the US only if the US economy has such massive financial problems? A better option might be to build a second, smaller US to be independent from the US economy's current debt issues.\n\nIn this way, the US would not be dependent on debt for its economy, but can instead focus on strengthening the American economy.

    "One of the biggest hurdles to recycling phones is that old mobile handset manufacturers no longer make the chips used to store information on computers. As a result, it is unlikely that any recycling system will be able to recover the electronic scraps currently sitting in recycling sites.

    "\"His story of a British-Pakistani boy's quest for an American dream is a stunning tale. His story also gives the global book market more of the same, and with it, all the more reason to be wary of potential dangers.\"\n\nThis is the very epitome of the \"American Dream\". One needn't look far to see that the majority of the immigrant classes in America are largely of Pakistani descent and that, in 2016, Pakistani-Americans have surpassed white Americans, making up 42% of the total population. How can we be sure this is not the result of a deliberate effort to import the \"white-skinned-Christian\" type?\n\nIf we are to be consistent, then the very mention of 'White' will bring up racial considerations within just about everyone's mind. We all know how the term came to be applied to a particular skin color. So why should the American Dream apply only to 'White'? Why not 'Chinese' when immigrants of the same ethnic descent make up 45-50% of all Chinese Americans? If an immigrant is 'white', why not 'Caucasian'? Why, the very idea that such things can be considered to be separate ethnic or national lines is absurd.\n\nThe issue of race and ethnicity in the United States is too loaded with problems for this to be dismissed out of hand. In fact, the American Dream was specifically conceived to offer immigrant children of the same race a clear pathway to an American life. If such a future was to be denied him or her due to race, the United States would lose the very foundations of the dream it is trying so hard to construct for new and new migrants. I would never wish for a 'white-skinned-Christian' type like these two winners of the Booker Prize to be denied their dreams; however, how we can be sure the two will not instead be the victims of discrimination?\n\nMany of those I have spoken with through personal experience concerning this matter have expressed a sense of \"hope\" for these wonderful young men. However, why are many people so confident about the outcome that such a beautiful story of \"immigrants overcoming adversity\" is the same as being a racist, xenophobic bigot?",

The raids were part of what the FBI calls an \"ongoing narcotics investigation being conducted by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.\" No charges have been filed against the two employees.\n\nAt the agency's offices on Monday, agents reportedly confiscated computers and some paper. It was not known whether the searches were related to the bribery charge, which alleges that Stodola approved the transfer of an unnamed employee's retirement money from the office's pension fund.\n\n\"These charges are troubling, and have nothing to do with their role in overseeing our pension benefits,\" Commissioner Tim Echols said.\n\nThis is nothing new for Stodola. When he was appointed secretary in 2010, he was immediately criticized for allegedly using public funds for personal gain, and for having multiple different companies in which to have dealings. At this time, Stodola's name was in the news for his role in the controversial decision to allow the controversial \"kiss cam\" at the 2009 Super Bowl. In that case, when a camera captured the kiss between quarterback Peyton Manning and his girlfriend, it sparked public outrage — including one citizen's attempt to boycott the event. Stodola issued what he called an apology for those comments, but that did not stop the boycott, and it cost Stodola his job and a $2,500 severance.\n\nThe governor, who appointed Stodola in May, defended Stodola:\n\n\"When you sign your job contract into law and you don't follow it, you forfeit the right to have it recognized,\" Gov. Nathan Deal told reporters Tuesday afternoon. \"You don't buy your position of employment, you don't borrow the money to buy you a job.\" Stodola was appointed by Gov. Sonny Per",
    "In his exclusive interview with BBC Radio 5 live's Jonathan Pearce live on Monday, John McEnroe said that he had spoken to Roger Federer by telephone in January about a number of potential offers. \"I think, when they said they were getting a contract and the contract was coming back and the contract was big enough that you could have just taken it… and they are not going to be able to say that they were not going to match anyone — and Roger wasn't going to give them a better contract — I thought that was a joke and I thought no way am I taking your money… and they said the Federer thing.\"\n\nAccording to Serena, the tennis world is in shock that McEnroe turned down Federer's massive deal. \"Everyone is talking about that because you know, when you have a big offer — it's unbelievable,\" she said on Monday. \"You know, I think the world's a little bit shaken up because that's obviously something that he's made a decision on and he and Roger have made a decision about it. I'm sure everybody has their own opinions, their own opinion, but like I said, obviously the world is a little bit shaken up about it.\"\n\nAlthough Serena and McEnroe have an old feud which has been ongoing for years now, Serena is confident that they can reconcile their differences. In fact, she said she is willing to \"come on with him to help him and maybe help him to get the best possible results and help him to grow a bit more and take a step over him. I think that's so cool that that's what we can do.\"\n\n\"He's one of the best guys in the world. This kid is a beast. You see, for years now we've been fighting this sport and now he's at the top. The kid's still a young, talented guy. He brings it every time and he has a chance to reach what he already has achieved. And I think we can work very well together going forward,\" said Serena.\n\nAfter going through the press conference, Serena's parents, John and Trudy, were visibly relieved. \"She's having a lot of fun here,\" John said with a smile, \"and she's really loving it. She's having a lot of fun being part of this and that's what's",

    "Sony Pictures is to back a new format for DVDs and Blu-ray discs – digital and disc-based – that will support high resolutions, higher frame rates and the ability to run at speeds faster than conventional video.\n\nThe format will be called Digital Intermediation Disc, or D-I (pronounced D-Y).\n\nThis means that it's the same thing as the so-called \"high definition\" DVD format that has been in use since 2011, although without a disc that can be played on a DVD player.\n\nSony is keen to use digital instead of traditional formats because it has a major foothold in high-definition television, with Sony's PlayStation 4, and it believes the quality of its products can be improved with digital technology.\n\n\nSony Pictures Motion Picture Group chairman Michael Lynton described the D-I format as \"a transformative technology\" that will enable Sony to become the leading supplier of 4K Ultra HD television.\n\nIt will allow for higher resolutions than were available in HD at the time of production with full 1080p 60 frames per second, a resolution not even achieved until now by high-definition Blu-ray disc in its current iteration.\n\nBlu-ray discs – the technology that DI was developed to provide – is based on a DVD's 16-bit pixel data and so would have to be converted to 16-bit and 4k for the technology to work.\n\nWhile the existing HD format is supported by most current DVD players, the format itself is incapable of playing in 4K.\n\nThe D-I format was created by Sony, but will initially be built by US company Technicolor.\n\nMr Lynton said: \"Sony has been pioneering 4K (ultra high performance display (UHD)) for DVD video over the past couple of years, and now we believe it's the best way to realise our vision to be the leading supplier of high-definition TV.\n\n\"The D-I format enables us to deliver 4K and UHD movies, photos and video content in high-wattage TVs for a better user experience. It also gives us the capability to introduce new and emerging formats that are not supported by current technology.\"\n\nThe move to offer a wider range of media that can be viewed with the Sony 4k disc – at a lower resolution, and in an ultra high-quality",

Mr Fitzgerald would not confirm plans to make a speech on immigration during her upcoming visit but said it would be 'important for our neighbours, for Ireland and Europe as a whole'. Irish ambassador to Italy Sean D Hogan will also travel with the minister in the hope of boosting the country's regional credibility.\"\n\nFor his part, Renzi expressed his gratitude to the State for the invitation for the speech and stated that he was very eager to meet with President Higgins in Brussels.\n\n\"I said a long time ago about my relationship with President Higgins that in future I hope I can see him in Brussels on a trip that is connected with this visit to Rome, with which my Irish friends have always been very open. This is an important meeting for European politics,\" Renzi added.\n\nThere has been much speculation over whether Italy will seek to remain in the EU's Schengen zone where it enjoys some freedom to roam and that the Italian PM has made similar remarks:\n\nRome had not decided, given the EU has promised it would 'keep its eyes and ears open' but Renzi said he wouldn't be surprised if Italy decided not to remain in Schengen and that this did not require any new legislation.\n\n\"We know that we are in a difficult situation. Even though Schengen is part of the legal system of a number of countries, the EU has given instructions that it won't take any more measures to keep people in and out of the Schengen area and, if they want to give us a visa-free regime with Ireland, then that's fine.

    "Kerr, as the Warriors celebrate a record 73 victories, is frustrated in the absence of Kevin Love. He said of Love, who played only 31 games: \"There's no way in the world we can beat this team unless Kevin is out the whole year.\"\n\nKerr's frustrations were in reference of the fact that he felt the team could have been more physical in its first round series against the San Antonio Spurs, the Warriors' opponents in the second round.\n\nKerr also commented when asked who would step up when Love comes out of the lineup: \"Myself, Klay Thompson, I'm not really sure who else needs to step up. Sometimes you win one, sometimes you win two. But for our team to feel confident going into the second, third, fourth, fifth round and being able to win three games, five-game series—that's the biggest difference when we get ready to play those teams. We've been able to do that.\"\n\nThe report continues by noting that Kerr's comment about Love coming out of the lineup as a leader of a team who has not lost in the playoffs was in opposition to the coaching staff. Kerr was asked and responded: \"They're all coaching for two reasons—they want to see the playoffs, they want to have the No. 1 seed. At the end of the day we got in. I don't know if you want to comment on that.\"\n\nKerr continued speaking about what was expected of the players as they prepare for the first series in 20 years against the Spurs. \"I'm a huge Popovich fan. This isn't going to be hard for him,\" said Kerr, who played under Popovich with the San Antonio Spurs from 1989–92. \"Pop has a very strong team, has a lot of great players. I really believe that if you get everybody healthy, this is not a real test for Pop. The only test is can they get over the hump, can they continue to try. Is there some adversity? Yeah.

Mr Brafman said the US attorney's office charged Mr Geithner without notifying him in advance and that he had been free to accept or decline any plea agreement offered. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr Brafman's statement said his client was \"cooperating with federal investigators, and the government's alleged criminal wrongdoing cannot be tolerated\".\n\nBoeing said in a statement on Tuesday that after learning of the charges \"we believe he entered a guilty plea to help the government get to the bottom of these cases\" and that it would co-operate with the government in \"any further necessary operations\".\n\nUS prosecutors first brought charges against Mr Geithner in March.

    "A Labour MP has urged the Government to intervene to make schools more attractive to young people, claiming a \"significant number\" of pupils who have just left primary school have been \"going native\" and not bothering to do their GCSEs. Ed Miliband has been forced to defend his party's plans to change the age of eligibility for university from 16 to 18, amid claims that thousands of teenagers are sitting the test, failing it and returning to the classroom.\n\n\nThe report was published in the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday and refers to a survey of 200 secondary schools in England which found that over two-fifths of pupils in England's secondary schools had failed at least one GCSE. The same survey, undertaken in 2010, showed that the number of young people who had failed three or more GCSEs was the same, with more than a quarter of 13-year-olds saying they knew only a rudimentary level of English. The report, called \"Hardcore truants\", suggests that the \"unprecedented\" rise in young people who failed to pass their GCSEs, has increased the number of people stuck in universities.\n\n\n\"In a world growing increasingly expensive and complex in every imaginable aspect, it's surprising that universities and young people don't seem to be more able to work out what they want to do,\" the article claims. \"Instead, they're going native.\"\n\n\nThe MP who wrote the piece, Alan Brown, who is a close associate of Ed Miliband, said the Prime Minister had \"taken this on\".\n\nBrown says in the article, \"It's a huge issue.

    "Video game giant Nintendo has unveiled an astonishingly innovative new Nintendo DSi handheld in the shape of the Euro version. The new unit - which has been produced for the first time in Europe - features 2-D and front-mounted video display and has a high-powered internal processor. But it is the design that really sets it apart. The Euro model makes the Nintendo DSi more like the iPhone 3G - and that is no small thing. The iPhone 3GS has been a huge success, with many critics claiming it offers great gaming experience at its very cheapest prices. Despite this, the market for the handset has been a little lacking compared with that of the iPhone. Nintendo argues that the Nintendo DSi, with its built-in high-end performance components, represents a huge leap forward for the DS and will be a game changer. It will be more powerful than the DS, too, and will come with a touch screen, while both units will be available on 1 January in Europe. Nintendo says the DSi will have a battery life of around 14 hours - that's eight hours longer than the DS. Mario Kart will also appear as a DSi exclusive, while Nintendo promises new content on all other Nintendo DS games, too. But it is Mario Kart that has so far become the clear winner on the Nintendo DSi. After more than one million units are sold in the UK, Nintendo will bring Mario Kart 8 to all other territories. The game will have all the classic DS features, including the new touch screen. It promises a more accessible, real-time racing experience thanks to the new 3D visuals of the DS.\n\nNintendo DSi and iPhone 3GS video game players via Wikipedia/Creative Commons",

Thank you to all my boys and my wife, my family, my closest friends, my parents, and everybody at snow patrol. I also want to thank you to everyone that supports this band! Keep rocking out! \"\n\n\"I've been apart of the band for just over two years and over the past nine months I've been trying to put a situation together for my future both as a person and a musician. I'm trying to transition from a solo artist to a member of a great band full of fantastic musicians, producers, engineers, and producers. \"I've taken my time with this and taken some time off playing live and I hope that people can respect this for what it is.\n\n\"I'm aware that snow patrol are one of the best hard rock bands that make music, and so I believe in that direction.

    "The US Department of Transportation is investigating how American Airlines' computer system is allowing passengers at Newark Liberty International Airport to board planes and change reservations without clearance from controllers – after airlines were forced to cancel more than 800 flights after a computer glitch.\n\nThe investigation could lead to civil fines for American Airlines.\n\n\"It is too early to tell what, if any, impact, if anything the investigation may have on the status of the investigation,\" US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told a news briefing during a visit to Washington DC, adding he will have more to say later. \"I'm looking forward to hearing more tomorrow.\"\n\nHe said the Department of Homeland Security, which is leading the investigation, will be \"making the decision on fines and what they consider appropriate\".\n\n\"I look forward to us having further discussions with the National Transportation Safety Board,\" Mr Foxx said, adding: \"I know they're working tirelessly to try to look for answers. Because I think they have a great deal of people working with them.\"\n\nThe investigation stems from reports that American Airlines was allowing passengers to change flights on its US domestic network and US international route without clearance by US air traffic controllers, which a number airlines said led to passengers getting off flights when they should not have been able to.\n\n\"We believe that we were made aware of it yesterday by some of our airlines and they're conducting their own investigation,\" Mr Foxx said. The situation was being \"managed at a high level\" at American. The department will wait for the board's findings, he added. Airlines said that all tickets for cancellations and adjustments were cleared with the airlines before passengers changed the flights.\n\nAn American Airlines spokesman said an announcement on the company's website on Wednesday morning had stated the airline had \"implemented additional and very specific procedures\" to ensure that all passengers on its domestic network were informed that changes without clearance from the system's operators, which operate under contract to the government.\n\n\"We continue to operate normally and are fully committed to provide passenger service,\" the spokesman added. American said it had made adjustments to systems that manage reservations, ticketing, flight departure and arrival times so that all reservations were routed appropriately and flight information could be updated without any interference.\n\nFAA spokeswoman Elizabeth Cory said that the agency has been notified about the allegations and that the incident is being investigated.

    "In the 1960s, millions of heterosexual couples started having sex after the death of a close friend. This, it was feared, would eventually lead to an increase in the number of cases of HIV. This warning, as we now know, proved alarmist: after a number of years, the rate of new infection was very much lower than has been the case for many years. The reason was a combination of factors - people in the 1970s did not use illicit drugs as they do today, and they were well informed.\n\nToday, there are still many couples who do have sex with each other, despite fears to the contrary. There are however risks associated with this practice.\n\nA study carried out by the NHS National Institute for Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) found that the number of new HIV infections among partners in Britain is increasing at a much slower rate than the number of new cases in the general population. Between 2000 and 2010, there was an annual decline of 1% over the year, says the study. In the early 1990s when HIV prevalence was much higher, the annual decline was more pronounced - 8%.",

    "Cyber criminals are turning their cyber weapons on governments and organisations around the world at breakneck pace. The number of reports from cyber attacks has soared in recent years, as more people are relying on the internet and personal devices to do their daily work, including banking.\n\nIt has been revealed that the number of cyber attacks in the UK has soared tenfold from 30,000 in 2010 to almost 250,000 this year, and over the last two years the number of reported attacks has risen by almost 400 per cent.\n\nSo who is behind the attacks? Experts say they look just like all the other types of attacks, which typically involve ransomware and credit card skimming for example, but they are different…\n\nCyber crooks target organisations, businesses and governments to steal intellectual property, then often use the victim's network to distribute the stolen data.\n\nRansomware is an example of a cyber attack that has the potential to harm a particular organisation if it is not paid for within a set period of time. This can include the use of encrypted files to slow down, or prevent the ability of the organisation's IT systems to function.\n\nThe latest wave of cyber attacks, also known as \"wiper\" attacks, are very similar to phishing and spear phishing. However, they are targeted more specifically at gaining access and getting the private and confidential data of the organisation's user, known as credentials, in order to carry out further operations.\n\nSome of the attacks have shown that cyber crooks will use a combination of tools such as ransomware that encrypts personal files on the computer and malware that takes access to the computer for a period of time – typically three to seven days, before being deleted.\n\nThey often carry out \"spear phishing\" to get user's email addresses and passwords, but this is another very common form of attack that can be easily bypassed.\n\nIt may seem like cyber crime has become an increasing problem, but the majority of incidents are very difficult to deter.\n\n\"It will be a lot easier to keep people safe if they know they are being stalked,\" says Mark Davies, director general of the UK Cyber Crime Centre.",

    "Police in South Carolina have decided not to press any charges against Bill Cosby for alleged sexual assault, a district attorney said yesterday, a situation his lawyer said amounted to a victory for the 77-year-old comedian and the woman he is accused of assaulting. \"I just don't see the case as very strong. I haven't made any decisions on the case at all,\" South Carolina District Attorney Scarlett Wilson told an evening news conference following a lunchtime meeting with Cosby's legal advisers in Camden, New Jersey. The decision was apparently made on advice from the police and prosecutors in Pennsylvania, whose case against Cosby is also pending, Wilson said. One of the only charges brought in court with Cosby was a misdemeanor charge of indecent assault in Pennsylvania earlier this year. The only possible criminal action brought by Cosby has been to pay a $1.2 million settlement to one of his accusers in 2005.\n\nReaders of Mediaite and other sites like it will recognize a trend here. Cosby's legal troubles come at a time when media consumers are more likely to see sensationalized coverage of alleged victimization cases. The general public has been trained since the advent of the Internet to expect a story about a sexual predator's victimization to make headlines. Media outlets are trying to draw in that audience by making these alleged victimizations front page news. While these cases do happen in real life and are dealt with in civil courts like any other legal proceedings, media coverage is usually a form of self-promotion for the perpetrators. The media has to provide some kind of sensationalism, no matter how ridiculous. In Cosby's case, there is so much at stake and he has so much at risk that he has little incentive to settle.\n\nThese cases aren't coming from nowhere. The general public is primed to view allegations of sexual victimization as not just a big issue, but proof of just how evil the world is. These stories fuel an unhealthy sense of entitlement in the American public. We feel compelled to look for confirmation that the world we see around us isn't as bad as it ought to be and that it can make a \"good guy\" out of us.\n\nThe more of these stories media outlets are willing to run, the more likely people will be to see such a story as inevitable and to dismiss the accuser and her claims completely.\n\nAs far as the media goes, we at Mediaite",
    "Bloggers take on the mainstream\n\nThe mainstream media are not popular with the public, and they are increasingly getting the attention of people who consider themselves the public online.\n\nAt its launch, the blogosphere was used mainly as a way for people to talk to each other. Now, there is a growing community of people around the world blogging about a wider variety of subjects.\n\nThe success of blogs has been aided by various ways of making blogging more convenient. A number of simple blogging software have been released which gives those who are not qualified to create blogs the ability to create a blog. These bloggers use the software to easily create a web site, which allows people to visit.\n\nOver the years, the popularity of blogging has increased enormously.

    "A Conservative Party leader has vowed to make Britain fairer by putting millions of pounds a year into areas that need it most - tackling social mobility, providing the NHS with cash and introducing a basic income or 'citizens £0'.\n\n\nIn an explosive manifesto ahead of the general election, the party's leader, David Cameron, has set out his plan to reverse a slide in living standards caused by the Government's \"tinkering and tinkering\" with the economy.\n\n\nHe writes: \"For too long, we have let down those left behind. Now, for the first time, I can make a real and firm commitment to fixing people up, not breaking them down.\n\n\n\"We will give every one of our children a decent start in life, and we will make sure that every single one of our children is able to achieve their dreams.\"\n\n\nIn the letter, seen by the Observer, he outlines a series of measures to help ensure the country is fairer - including a basic income for everyone aged 25 or more, with a cap on benefits paid to those with children under 16.\n\n\nHe also pledges to fund the introduction of a new citizens £0 benefit, or \"citizens £0\", by putting money into a fund for new ideas in areas such as health, education, transport and local authority reform.\n\n\nMr Cameron also pledges to \"invest in Britain's infrastructure by investing an extra £20billion a year by the end of the Parliament to ensure we're the fittest and healthiest country in the world\".\n\n\nHe added: \"And finally, this means we must start using the money that's coming into the country in the right areas.\n\n\n\"Here's how we'll invest in our country:\n\n\nSaving the NHS from the axe\n\nFor over two years, the Conservative Government has been cutting funding for the NHS and its ability to provide vital healthcare.\n\n\nLast year, it handed the health service £3.5billion, a 40 per cent reduction.\n\n\nBecause of this, we face potentially long delays in our vital new cancer drugs and treatments being made available, while our urgent priorities for care are increasingly threatened by a growing demand for hospital beds and ambulances, and other critical public services which depend on being able to pay for them.\n\n\nThese are problems that have been caused by the failure of the last Labour Government",
    "A court in Spain has ruled that Barcelona's controversial split-caps system amounts to an illegal state aid scheme — as it favours Spanish players over foreign ones — in the ongoing case against the club.\n\nThe ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) comes after four clubs in Spain — Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Valencia and Villarreal — brought a similar case against their respective national leagues, claiming the state subsidies were causing unfair advantages for players at the club.\n\nThe Spanish Football Association (RFEF) filed a formal complaint to CAS on October 16, 2009, alleging that its competition rules for the 2007-08 season contained several sections — such as Article 40 — that were unfair and contrary to the spirit of the Spanish football legislation.\n\nAt the time this case was filed, the RFEF estimated that around 75% of the total spending in domestic league games was made through a player's wages.\n\nRFEF claimed that this system helped teams like Barcelona to collect large subsidies from their respective leagues, and that the payments were provided by the government instead of players. This alleged state aid was justified to ensure the national leagues met their obligations to the national sports competition, while players were paid under the table in order to prevent the clubs from being caught out during the season.\n\nHowever, the government denied any state aid, but instead maintained that its laws did not affect any other sports. However, this is what the CAS ruling says:\n\n\"the provisions protecting players against discriminatory or illegal practices are applicable to the allocation of benefits to clubs. It is evident from Articles 23 and 25 that the rules are not intended to impede competitive conditions in the clubs, but that they apply to the rules of competition as such. These principles permit the state to benefit from a fair and equitable competition by providing support, facilities and resources to encourage the development of the national sport, and the establishment of a fair, stable and regulated environment (article 22).\"\n\nAt the time that the first complaint was filed, Barcelona and Real Madrid had been declared to be first and fifth best clubs in world football, respectively.\n\nThe ruling does not set a limit upon the damages Barcelona could recover, merely stating they are eligible for compensation \"of the same value at that time\" as the subsidy. However, a \"sufficient amount\" of the court ruling should",

    "Manufacturing, which is the engine which drives America's economy, is currently suffering from the so-called \"great recession\" that followed Barack Obama's election in 2008.\n\nBusiness confidence is at a five-year low, unemployment is stuck near 10%, GDP has slowed considerably below its pre-crisis peak and, according to the latest numbers from the US Treasury Department, the deficit is set to hit a record as the US continues to get its debt under control.\n\nThe US president's signature economic policy has failed to revive business but there is a growing consensus that this is no longer a permanent change in the global economic order.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to Germany, Barack Obama said the American economy was poised to strengthen, but for now manufacturing is slowing.\n\n\"Partially because we had such a deep recession and because we had such a prolonged period of weak and slow growth, there's been a lot of retrenchment and that hasn't been helping businesses. But in some cases that retrenchment is causing businesses to make very tough decisions,\" he said.\n\nWhile Mr Obama has blamed America's lack of competitive advantage for its economic problems, other experts say it is a lack of supply: a combination of depressed labour costs, a dearth of skilled workers, and technology being held back overseas.\n\nAt the end of every month manufacturers need to pay back their debts, which now exceed $1tn, and so the US manufacturing sector must balance consumer demand with paying back its debts each month. The demand is strong right now and so manufacturers are hiring - both in the UK and the US - which means they must pay back creditors as well as the interest they pay on their debts. At the same time manufacturing has been hit by a wave of Chinese competitors entering the industry. Chinese manufacturers have been able to undercut the American and European suppliers and so have their own demand for their products at a reduced rate.\n\nBut the situation in the USA is actually much worse than the official numbers suggest. A report today by the Economic Policy Institute found that the employment market for manufacturing workers in August was far worse than it was in July, suggesting it is worse now. According to the EPI, \"While the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.5 per cent, many manufacturing workers, and particularly the newly displaced, continue to struggle with anemic wages.\"\n\nManufacturing has",
    "The new Chancellor of the Exchequer announced today an austerity package of about £30bn over the next five years, with the majority of this going to tax cuts for the richest 1 per cent.\n\n\nAnd this headline says nothing about the fact that the majority of that £32bn is just part of the Conservative manifesto as part of its pledge to spend an average of 1 per cent of GDP on the NHS. In reality the majority of it is going to raise taxes on millions of people.\n\n\nSo the headline is misleading in that it fails to mention that there will not only be less tax for the very richest, but a lot less tax for people trying to survive on just 2% of the national income.\n\n\n\"The budget will add £3bn, or 0.2 per cent of national income, to this year's deficit.\" This is what the Chancellor said. \"In my new budget this evening, I will take action to put the deficit on a clear downward path.\"\n\n\nThe next sentence goes on to say that we will need the same 0.2 per cent of national income to make the deficit go down by 2020...a year later than the Government now wants.\n\n\nThe next sentence says another 0.2 per cent of national income will be paid to reduce the deficit further to 0.1 per cent of national income in 2016/17 and, even further later, another 0.2 per cent in 2017/18. (The Tories did not include a specific figure for 2016/17 until last September, but it is very possible they may increase it if this does not work and also 2018/19 if they believe they are going to win an overall majority at the next election.) And then in the next sentence, they finally admit that the deficit will only fall to 0.6 per cent by the mid-2020s...the year this article was printed.\n\n\nSo a mere 0.2 per cent of national income will now be paid to reduce the deficit for another five years...this is far more in keeping with what the Tories said last May. The implication is that there are no plans to bring the deficit down further or to put it back on better track - in fact we'll do the exact opposite.\n\n\nYou could have chosen to read the full article but you won't do any good.

As such, we plan to roll out our 3G mobile network throughout the UK by the end of 2011.\"\n\n\nOfcom already has clear guidance in place which says mobile operators should not offer \"non-broadcast services\" – i.e. those outside of what the existing radio spectrum is used for – in the spectrum. So as far as Virgin is concerned, \"non-broadcast services\" would be over-the-air television.\n\n\nBut because Virgin is not on the radio industry's \"broadcast list,\" it would be hard pressed to offer such services over-the-air either.\n\n\n\"It does give Virgin the right to offer some additional services,\" Rob Ellis said.\n\n\nHe said Ofcom was still giving advice to mobile providers on what services could be advertised without being counted by the regulator, but that this would in practice be minimal.\n\n\nThe regulator last month rejected a bid by mobile operator Three to have the Radio Frequency (RF) band reclassified as being covered by its broadcast services licence to broaden its spectrum access.\n\n\nIt also said there was no need to re-examine the status of the 2,000MHz band in the 2G and 3G bands, which are currently used for television broadcasts.",
    "British Coal is to cut another 20,000 jobs as the firm struggles to revive fortunes after falling coal prices caused it to cut its annual forecast two years ago over Brexit fears.\n\nThe collapse in the price of UK coal – which accounts for over 60% of its output - has prompted annual operating losses that threaten to wipe out the £2.5bn it spends each year on maintaining some of Britain's biggest pits, sources said.\n\nBMO Capital Markets said yesterday that the firm could shed another 20,000 jobs by the end of next year \"as it suffers an unrelenting, sustained slide in coal prices\".\n\nThe number of union jobs reduced over the past 12 months is now at a \"historically low\" level thanks to the \"catastrophic decline\" in the value of the pound, a senior union official said.\n\nA BMO Capital Markets spokesman said the company remained committed to developing the West Somerset site and would continue to \"invest in our people so we can maintain the most sophisticated plant\".\n\nThe cuts come following another significant slump in prices. BMO Capital Markets last month cut its forecast for a £10.6bn write-down for the coal sector on Brexit fears, following the sharp fall in the price of the metal.\n\nNow it expects a £0.4bn write-down by the end of the financial year, with annual losses of £2.1bn by end-2017.\n\nIn a separate announcement about its 2017 financial results, it said that despite its lower outlook \"this will be the ninth straight year in which BMO Capital Markets reduced its operating margin by at least 30bp\" in 2017 – compared with the average of the past 15 years.\n\nChief executive Anthony Seldon said BMO's 2016 profit after tax (PAPB) was £846m, down £12.8m from the year before, and that overall the company had recorded a loss of £1.35bn in 2016.\n\nMr Seldon said there had been a \"significant fall in the value of the pound, affecting our profitability and earnings\", and said he expected the \"deteriorating\" value of \"platinum\" at the Port Talbot smelter by the end of the year would cut operating profit from the smelter by £700m to between £500 and £600m.",

    "There have been suggestions that Jeremy Corbyn's leadership is being attacked for a variety of reasons, but one of the strangest claims involves two senior members of the Labour Party. The Guardian has been seeking to establish the truth. They were both arrested last May after being discovered on camera on the day of the EU referendum polling station close-down in Oldham. One of the men is John Rentoul, the Labour MP for Tottenham. The other is Tom Watson, Labour's deputy leader. He is the son of former deputy leader Harriet Harman and has been the party's general election co-ordinator since October. Here are some of the claims made to the Guardian, which may or may not have any basis in fact: …The video appears to show a pair of men inside the polling station. One has been described as \"tall, stocky and fit\" and is wearing a dark blue jacket (with a hood), dark trousers and trainers. The other is \"skinny, very fit and dressed in red\". No further details are given.\n\nThe video above shows two men in very sharp suits entering the polling station, taking ballots out of a nearby machine and placing them on a table. After a few moments, the man in the red jacket is seen placing the ballot box on top of the ballot box which he was then assisted by the other man. This has apparently been done without assistance from the others.\n\nIt could very well be that these two men have left the polling station. However, if not, why would they leave the boxes in the same place? Why did they not come back to remove the other ballot boxes? If the others had not removed the boxes, there would be no issue with having the ballot boxes in the correct place.\n\nThe second clip shows a man placing a ballot box on top of another ballot box.\n\nWhy would the man in red bring his own piece of paper, but not pass him a pen or pencil? What makes him think that he is able to fill out his ballot paper without assistance or in any other way? If there is some sort of misunderstanding, why would he not explain it to the cameraman or the other man?\n\nThe man in the red jacket, who appears to be a police officer, is seen to leave the polling station about 10 minutes later. Why was the ballot box that he left in place in",

That seems like an incredible age, yet many people still struggle to understand how it is possible to return from injury so quickly. This is even more so in the case of a player who had been competing at the highest level of the professional tennis circuit for eight years at this point. But after returning from injury and going through a fairly disappointing first season at Roland Garros, Alex Yachvili has finally made his way towards the French Open quarterfinals. His opponent in the second round at Roland Garros, No. 8 seed Stanislas Wawrinka, has clearly come through a difficult year in which he failed to qualify for the semifinals at the first clay court season of a decade, and struggled with a series of wrist and knee injuries during this tough second clay court season. This tournament also marks the final tournament for two young players in the ATP World Tour's French Open circuit as well, as 20-year-old Nicolas Mahut and 17-year-old Kei Nishikori have also made it to another quarter-final at the French Open this year.",

The LBMA, which has been trading as the Bullion Market Group (BMG) until now but has recently reconstituted itself at the behest of the LBMA, will now include Lewis & Francis as a member.\"\n\nAnd in January 2011, the LBMA released its latest report.

As such, the LBMA welcomes LS & F's entry into the LBMA family.\n\n\"While the majority of bullion trades through the London bullion market, the LBMA has also continued its pioneering work in developing a Gold Fund as an alternative trading venue. LS & F will be the first LBMA member to offer its customers the option of trading gold in a fully segregated fund on LBMA's markets through the purchase of Gold Futures Contracts (GFCs.) GFCs, in turn, will be traded at the LBMA through the use of their newly created LBMA Gold Futures Exchange (GXBX) and their proprietary LBMA Exchange (LBMAX).\"\n\nThe LBMA said it will begin to distribute the first shares of the LBMA Gold Fund to LBMA members only in mid-2011.\n\nThe following is the following quote from an interview with Lewis & Francis president Michael Lewis, who is now the Company's Chairman, President, and CEO.

    "Futuristic wi-fi capable of one gigabit per second speeds has been announced by scientists in Cardiff.\n\nThe university unveiled a breakthrough at a research forum on Wednesday with the project being led by Dr Mark Clague, a University of Wales undergraduate who works for the university's science academy.\n\n\"The University's project will use the latest quantum dots technology, which has no physical walls to block the quantum signals,\" said Dr Clague.\n\n\"What's interesting to me is that they have created an ultra fast wi-fi signal which will give you a Gigabit, or 1,000 times better speed than existing methods for wi-fi.\"\n\nThe news comes when researchers are already using nano-sized silicon nanowires to transmit information, albeit in a slower fashion, in nanoseconds.\n\nIt is also the first time quantum dots have been used to create an ultra- fast radio frequency signal.\n\nCurrently, it is estimated that a single fibre in the UK would need to be four times longer than the previous record holder for wi-fi to be able to connect to a device twice as fast.\n\n\"I have always looked forward to finding an ultra fast wi-fi signal,\" said the university's Vice-Chancellor Professor Paul Butler.\n\n\"With the help of quantum dots technology, the University is creating new ways of accessing information and communication on ultra fast wi-fi connections.\"\n\nThe University's new signal will be able to carry up to 1.2 gigabits - or 1,000 times greater data capacity - a second, and is faster than current systems which can transmit up to 3 megabits a second.\n\nScientists have previously predicted that this technological revolution, known as \"quantum dots\", promises to change every aspect of how we communicate and interact, from what to put in a package and how many glasses of liquid we need to carry with us, to a number of devices and devices we already have.\n\nQuantum dots are nanoparticles that can absorb and transmit electron electrons, and therefore could also be used in future 'batteries' to store more data than current systems. This would enable wireless broadband to be much denser, allowing devices such as televisions to have better contrast and make screens more vivid and easy to read.",

This would effectively put the process on hold for four years.\n\nThe European Commission will now consider whether a European patent court is the right location for the process. It said in an e-mail to members of the European Parliament, which makes up the European Parliament's legal affairs committee:\n\n\"We believe it important that the European Intellectual Property (IP) Community (EIPC) take a leading role in the development of the new system for obtaining design rights, so the ITP Council that is responsible for reviewing IPR issues, should have the opportunity to ensure that the ITP Council has a clear picture of how the system would work and how we are going to proceed.\"\n\nThe European Software Publishers and Software Alliance have said they are \"not opposed\" to the postponement of implementation of the patent law, but insist that a European patent court is \"essential\" to ensure a level playing field when it comes to innovation.\n\nRichard Lloyd, the CEO of the ITP Council, said: \"We believe that having a patent court for intellectual property (IP) is essential. This is why the Patent Act was changed to include a patent court last year, and why we are working to implement the patent law into law in a timely manner.\"\n\nFor its part, industry body the European Software Publishers and Software Alliance (ESPA), told e-mail: \"We would welcome a timely implementation of European patent policy.

    "GARGOYNE — A London court heard how an elderly care home owner threatened a fellow resident at gunpoint in the early hours of Wednesday by pointing a gun at her and telling her there would be \"blood\" if she was not handed over. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had lived in her Cobham home since 1986. In 2010, her husband decided to leave her and buy the property he was living in and set about selling his belongings and moving his family out. The police said he threatened his elderly neighbour in August 2010 by pointing a gun at her and telling her the same thing would happen if she did not hand over the keys within minutes. It took officers nearly an hour to gain entry to the property as the man was locked in the garage from the inside. He was arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm and the man at the house — who could not be identified for legal reasons — was reported missing a short time later. In court, a psychiatric expert said the man had suffered severe head injuries from a fall years ago. His brain function had suffered and he had developed a condition which left him unable to make decisions. He was not on any kind of medication and he did not know his way around the house. The psychiatric report concluded the man was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, the BBC's Daniel Sandford in London reported. He had no previous convictions and was found not guilty of the offences in January this year. The man had been allowed to remain at the care home while his mental health recovery took place. After the incident, he was allowed back to live in his Cobham home, a court was told. The court also heard the suspect, who had a prior conviction for grievous bodily harm, had threatened to kill the man during the incident and had also threatened to kill three of their family members.\n\nSo why doesn't the government provide mental health care to our military and veterans, but they provide \"socialize[d] mental health services to the public so we all get taken care of\"?\n\nThe article continues:\n\nA doctor at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust told the court that although the man had a history of mental illness that had \"not subsided\" in the previous 16 months he was not the perpetrator and he was \"not at all on medication\". \"But we have to remember this is a",

He estimates it could cover about 75% of the city.\n\nBut a computer grid is already a reality.\n\nThe British and American governments have both put a system in place called the National Integrated Long Range Planning Environment (InLARPE). It gathers critical data on weather, and lets computer scientists analyse, sort, and predict that data over a year or longer.\n\nIt provides weather forecasts even in areas where there is no reliable radio frequency (RF) radio signal between the centre of Europe and Africa. No matter how big the radio signal or wireless technology, the storm data will usually only get into the wrong hands by someone else. And the power of that information is massive.\n\n\"No one has any idea how a city like New York, which is more than 300 times smaller than London, can even survive a storm, let along have to cope on its own,\" said Bill Hare, head of the Global Systems Division at Accenture.\n\nMore or Less: Behind the stats Listen to More or Less on BBC Radio 4 and the World Service, or download the free podcast Download the More or Less podcast More stories from More or Less\n\nIn LARPE's first decade, it produced a single month (April 2013) of predictions that were accurate at 99.1% of the time.

It provoked a national debate about policing, social inequality and racial attitudes.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Mr Brown's body lay in a public area in Ferguson until his funeral by the Rev Al Sharpton\n\nImage copyright AP Image caption Protesters in New York City rallied against the shooting of Mr Garner\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption In Ferguson, protesters gathered by the police department headquarters after its lights went out on Thursday night\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Many across the country said they had spent money on equipment to commemorate the death of Mr Brown\n\nWhile most people still hold deep distrust of police in America - trust among blacks is at its lowest since the civil rights movement began in the 1960s - many now support the Black Lives Matter movement and are inspired by the example of Martin Luther King Jr, who led marches in the 1960s as a black civil rights campaigner.\n\nWith this in mind, Mr Brown's parents decided not to visit Washington during the Democratic convention in July to avoid the national outrage that may have followed a visit by a prominent black Republican.\n\nMr Brown made history two years ago with his death (at the hands of Officer Wilson) but did much more than that. It was an event that galvanised white and African-American leaders to speak out on a problem that had always existed, albeit to a lesser extent now, but still marked people's lives.\n\nFor many people, Mr Brown was a symbol of the injustice that was always going on in the United States.\n\nHe was black but he was not like them. He was unarmed. He could not do what many blacks did in the civil rights movement and take violent action. But this was a man whose",
    "Campbell, 40, becomes second Liberal backbencher to call time on parliamentary career\n\nCampbell is back!\n\nThe Liberal Party of Canada has confirmed that MP Bruce Campbell has returned to his cabinet post in the House of Commons after being forced to cancel his own re-election bid last November.\n\nA party statement said Campbell is also now vice-chair of the party's election campaign. The party also said that the election campaign team for Campbell will be led by Chris Rogers, general secretary of the Ontario Liberal Party (OLP).\n\nCiting sources, the CBC reported on March 2 that Liberal leaders were unhappy with the decision and that there had been internal discussions regarding the move. On the same day, however, the House of Commons returned to the House of Commons for a scheduled two days of question period.\n\nCampbell was forced to withdraw as an MP in November as he announced in December he would no longer be a candidate. Sources said he was facing criticism from grassroots Liberal members for his failure to deliver the party's campaign promises.\n\nWhile the Liberal Party was quick to publicly praise Campbell's appointment, former Liberal MP Adam Vaughan, who lost an October 2008 by-election, said that his return to the party's cabinet was \"unnecessary.\"\n\n\"Bruce Campbell obviously has the potential to move the party forward and make things better,\" he said. \"But he's also had a long line of Liberals who've lost their seats, and they're not coming out of this game without some sort of payback. Bruce is a nice man, and I'm sure he will be helpful and that everyone will be better off when he is out of politics.\"\n\nBut other Liberals were not so quick to endorse Campbell's return.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to say anything bad about a man who has a family to support and a job to do and some of his colleagues,\" Conservative cabinet minister John Duncan told the Globe and Mail in a phone interview.\n\n\"I have never been a supporter of the party being in the media, where everything is about you — where you have absolutely no influence and no responsibility. So I don't support, and never will support, any form of an internal politics within the Liberal Party.\"\n\nWhile Campbell did not comment to the Globe and Mail, he did issue a statement through his office stating that his first priority will",

It's a great opportunity for us to explore this unique world in a new way.\n\n\"When we thought about the idea for the US remake we immediately went for Hugh Grant. He's a role actor in every sense of the word and has everything we're looking for. His energy and passion are something that has always inspired us.\"\n\nMatt Berry, from BBC in the UK, said: \"Everyone at the BBC loves EastEnders so we're extremely proud to be able to bring the iconic comedy back. 'EastEnders' is one of the great shows in British TV and that means everyone will be buzzing with excitement to follow the new series.\"\n\nTCTA president Jim Doane said: \"EastEnders created a British institution in its long history, and the brand has the ability to live on. ITV's decision to bring the show back at the same time as BBC Worldwide and our strong belief in the brand and the legacy the series holds in the UK means we believe in doing everything we can to keep the brand alive.\n\n\"It is an enormous feat to recreate a hit show with the same cast and crew on the other side of the pond. We are looking forward to this and can't wait to see what people think when they watch it. We want to tell the stories that we know and understand",

However, officials have said that they are not in a different legal class to Americans.\n\nThe claim was put to Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, national policing lead for specialist crime threat, as part of a Government inquiry, and will be considered at a hearing on Tuesday.\n\nBut he said: \"There are no different legal grounds for the British Government to be looking into the NSA or GCHQ.\n\n\"We are only doing what we are told. It is the NSA and GCHQ that need a bit of explaining.\"\n\nHe added: \"We have been told by the intelligence agencies that they use the same legislation in the UK and the US.

However, the deal is not expected to have a material impact on either the Swiss economy, or the Swiss people's pocketbooks.\n\n\"This [deal] demonstrates the ability of companies like Swiss cement to build and protect the country's international and social image as it grows and creates new jobs.

Their second album You're As Good As I Am was released in March 2014 and went on to sell over 20,000 copies worldwide.\n\n\"It's really cool that we're recognised by such an established magazine like NME, the biggest rock magazine in the world,\" said bandleader/choreographer Chris Butler. \"We don't think of ourselves as a band that's really new – we've been playing for 10 years, as bands do – but we're now more like 'rockstars' and it's nice for us to be recognised by NME.\n\n\"Being in that company of bands that you've collaborated with for so long makes you feel really special and makes you feel like you can take the world on tour with you,\" he added.\n\nButler last week said The Struts could release new, as yet untitled material, which could be recorded by their live band.",
    "This post is a copy/paste of another post with very mild nudity removed\n\nPlease understand that by creating this post, I am not attacking the woman or her experience. I want this to become a positive conversation about sexism in the gaming industry. We need more games with female protagonists and more women playing games that aren't about getting your body hit or being sexually assaulted. We need more games with female characters with agency and story lines that don't just follow the damsel in distress trope, but actually have a bit more depth to them. I'm hoping this can be that step.\n\nAs the title suggests... I am tired of seeing posts about the sexual victimization of females in video games.\n\nIt has been brought to my attention by an editor at the games site Rock Paper Shotgun that Clara's entire post was edited by a mods and there is no mention of her sexual relationship with her rapist and it was later removed by the site.\n\nIn this post, she writes a touching tribute to Anita Sarkeesian, in which they discuss the fact that they never actually read her work and can no longer stand by it once they've seen the truth. \"But if Anita Sarkeesian's work hasn't inspired and been beneficial enough to her, then I'm sure it can't possibly have been harmful!\"\n\nAlso she talks about how she wants to keep this article being a positive and meaningful story of empowerment. But there have been many posts talking about the sexual nature of the video games that she played and how she should \"just have been raped by her parents, by her boyfriend, when she was in puberty\".\n\nI don't want this to become a negative story, but an empowering one. I hope that at least many people will take a moment of thought that we still need more female characters in video games and hopefully many will take the time to read this article.\n\nI hope you're all with me.\n\nAnd please remember to watch the full thread on reddit (and the comments) for some good discussion about the topic. http://www.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/2i1bq6/so_tired_of_seeing_posts_about_clara/",
    "There are a few things we need to start with to get to a clean clean water source:\n\n1) Eliminate all forms of the consumption of water. 2) Make sure we have the infrastructure necessary for water distribution and storage - dams, water storage, and pipelines. 3) Eliminate the consumption of non-essential, or non-essential water. If there is a way that you do not need the water, then not to waste it. 4) Have emergency plans for a disaster or act accordingly.\n\nI believe the first part is obvious - we have to eliminate drinking water (and drinking water alone is an issue). The rest requires some creative thinking, but here goes.\n\nThere exist many water issues today, some of which, when properly handled, could have a positive impact on a population. For instance – water being consumed, and desalinated: a significant issue for both population and environment. This is a topic for another blog post.\n\nFor this article in particular, I would like to focus on desalination.\n\nIn countries where they have the capacity to produce water, they sometimes do this, for one of these reasons:\n\n1) They have to (costly is more accurate, since the investment required is high) because people in their country do not have access to clean water, but do not have the means or time to develop water filtering capabilities. In other words, it is easier for them to produce the water if it will not have to be boiled, then desalinized.\n\n2) They must, or at least could, because their water supply becomes a liability, given the amount of contaminants used for production, or how quickly the supplies are exhausted.\n\nI think there are 4 ways in which a country can do this:\n\nIt can be very expensive (e.g. China)\n\n(e.g. China) It can take a long time (China)\n\nIt can be dangerous (India, Pakistan, the USA, USA, Iran)\n\nIt is very expensive and dangerous (USA)\n\nThe main problem with any of these solutions is the fact that they do not have a long-term perspective of long term consequences.\n\nFor instance, China has no plans to discontinue their expensive and wasteful use of the Hubei River (they take more of it to purify",
    "The above meme is really quite simple: The people who posted it are all people who would happily change into a caricature of every stereotype that they believe exists in the United States. What if you went over there and changed your name? And what if you lived there for years and had your own television show and made a fortune out of it. You'd change in the ways they want you to change. And you'd like it. You'd love it.\n\nAnd if you went back and changed your name to something more like what they want you to be, but still be themselves, they would no longer dislike you and will likely not accept you back. They want to be you, and they may have succeeded at it before, but it is unlikely that you will have achieved complete self-actualization. So the only real way to change into a person they actually want to be is to live out every stereotype they believe exists in the United States. You can't change the environment, or even your own behavior once you've been born and brought into it, but you have the power to change your own attitude, attitude that is born out of a mindset of wanting to be who others want you to be.\n\nYou could, of course, try just about anything, but they will either see through you, or they will treat you just as horribly as people do to each other that they actually like. And people who don't appreciate the things that they like are not always good people, at least not in this world.\n\nIt sounds bleak, but I actually think it's kind of optimistic that we can change, the way we're changing. As in: A lot of people on Reddit were very angry at what their parents did in the '80s and '90s, but that anger has only been growing and spreading in the past two decades, to the point where some people are getting their parents to sign divorce papers and some are actually making sure their parents of all different ethnic backgrounds get divorced. People are starting to realize that the things that their parents did to them weren't good ones at all. People are recognizing that people are not good, that things don't have to be that way. That they don't have to treat each other poorly, or be mean.\n\nAs someone once said, \"Life is what happens to you while you're making",
    "\"A series of recent articles in a popular Chinese news magazine, 《The Globalist》, in which a \"reporter from abroad\" describes the current situation in mainland China more favorably than the United States government itself has done. This seems to be due to Chinese authorities being very conscious of the fact that any U.S. government news channel broadcasting the news \"too critically\" of China, would have the potential to bring the U.S. government and its officials into \"controversy\". The article written by a New York Times correspondent has caused a few journalists in China to think twice before publishing anything critical of their own government, so here are some of their thoughts.\n\nOn the first page of the magazine is a photograph of a row of large construction projects underway in Beijing, and on the second page is a column on the upcoming Olympics and the problems they will cause. The headline of page one is \"Chinese authorities have taken action to solve the huge population problem\", and on page two is the very upbeat story \"The new Beijing Olympic Games may change history, but they worry some critics\".\n\nAfter this picture of large-scale construction, there are three articles on the first page about the Tiananmen Square protest of 1989, on which two sections are quoted: one about the protesters and how they were beaten, another about the demonstrations outside the government buildings where the protests took place, and one about the students at Beijing's university that killed themselves in protest. The last quoted article is the one about the students' death. [It is not clear",

Now, they're being charged for it (in our country, at least).\n\nI didn't think about any other costs. I didn't think about how it might affect anyone else. I figured he'd be happy with his gift, plus I know he would have done it without asking. He had been planning to send a card to the friend he was coming home with, too; but somehow I doubt they will even open it.

I feel compelled to tell these people: you're on your own at this point. I'm not responsible for your financial decisions. You need to do as much research as you are comfortable with, think for yourself, and talk to your friends, family, and coworkers about what you've decided to do.\n\nHere's to hoping that my friend gets some much needed sleep before his flight, and that he sleeps for a little while, before waking up this morning to find the world has suddenly turned upside down.",

So after I get married, I'm going to live with him, but since he's from overseas, I have no idea what country he's from. He has two older brothers from Australia, and he's never been there before, so I'm confused about all the terms he is learning. He goes to school in the U.S., so has never learned Japanese, Italian, Thai, or French in school. I was thinking I could ask him to start doing my homework for me, but I feel a bit awkward about it.

I don't remember my password for the autoresponder, I just looked up things along the way in hopes of finding it.\n\nDay4: I received a package from Amazon stating that I'd receive two books, and two DVDs in the mail, for the price of $9 each. When I asked about the price of the books, or whether it was a deal, my guess was it would be cheaper if I bought them first, so I did this, and received the DVD.\n\nDay21: I also received a package of \"posters\" and some \"postcards\" to send as well, because I wanted to share with everyone how much people have been helping out. I had no idea, the posters were from some kind of online book club, and the cards were from a local comic book writer, who received a pile of stuff during a charity event. I guess it was awesome, I didn't know.\n\nDay55: A few more packages have been arriving all week long. I received several \"postcards\" this Wednesday, they weren't really postcards.

    "My first job — almost 15 years ago — allowed for about 2 weeks of guaranteed leave following pregnancy. That's when I began to realize that I had something to do with my health, but that my job didn't care enough to fix it. I started to ask the tough questions about my work and realized that I could do what I wanted to do, as a freelancer and stay at home and take care of myself and my families. I felt like my work mattered, that I made a difference, but it turned out I didn't.\n\nIn the beginning they offered me a ton of benefits to make the hours work for me. Things like paid holidays, health insurance, paid time off and more. But I refused to work under those conditions. Even then, I knew I was the sole bread winner in my family, and the time off was important to us. So the hours were still too long. I told them so, and they didn't budge. I worked on my hours, but didn't let the benefits change my mind. In the meantime I worked full-time, and my income wasn't as high as it used to be, but I knew that, if I worked hard enough, my hourly rate could get higher. After working nearly 60 hours a week for almost 2 full years, I told my boss I was happy working that many hours and took a pay cut. Because I felt that my work made an impact. I could choose to work under any rules I wanted, and if they put a cap on how many hours I could work in a day, I'd still be happy.\n\nI didn't feel like my work mattered, but I worked hard and felt like I still made a difference.

    "We recently had a conversation in the podcasting community regarding one of our favorite passive immersion podcasting activities: reading in Spanish without realising it (or without even meaning to because I've never done it). We're not talking listening to a podcast or watching some TV show. We're talking getting from point A to point B totally silently, just listening.\n\nWe had an idea: what if Spanish podcasts could be built in such a way that you could read or listen in a way with real immersion that would challenge you, so that your eyes would become full of new and interesting things, and you'd enjoy it?\n\nA few podcast listeners got in touch and asked about the best way to implement this idea into a podcast. And I said to myself: wow, so many good ideas. I want to help.\n\nSo here we are: a few weeks ago, I asked a friend to teach me how to build a podcast. I thought about it for a while, and I decided that I would go out and find a lot of Spanish podcasts and write about them. And maybe other people like the same thing that I like.\n\nI asked around. I wrote to my podcaster friends. I listened to other podcasts and I did interviews. But I still wanted to understand what I should create. So I started looking for podcasts that others had done: ones that had been praised, ones people had recommended. Then I thought… well, I might be able to write about what I'm building and give it a try.\n\nSo, the beginning was slow, because I had to listen to a lot of podcasts. I listened to over 4000 podcasts and picked out about a dozen that I thought might be worth your time. And now that I've got a dozen (thank you everyone), I'm finally ready to publish. And I think that it's a pretty cool start. So I'm looking for feedback. If you like any of my podcasts and would like to see them written up, let me know. I'd like to add them to a special collection with their original host (although probably it'll just be in the same collection as the main podcasts). Feedback is welcome.\n\nI'm working on building this whole thing piece by piece. I was listening to many podcasts and getting ideas for episodes.

    "The \"I don't know why this people accept it\" post was a reply to a post and subsequent comments by \"the_gottabear\"\n\nThe_Gottabear's original post was titled \"I can't believe you guys. It's like my job all over again to go to a school with a fat majority and support a fat culture.\"\n\nAfter \"the_gottabear\" posted \"I don't know why this people accept it\", reddit administrators deleted the original post and replaced it with another which removed all references to the original title and added a third post which read \"As I see it: the problem is that not everyone is comfortable with the fat acceptance people and when they realize the reason they're uncomfortable is not because of what they're doing, but because they're afraid and/or don't fit in the scene. As to the first point, that's definitely true that people who say they have no interest in fat positivity (like most people from fat hate groups) likely have little if any interest in actual fat acceptance or in helping to create a fat positive culture.\"\n\nThe new post was titled \"Fat people are people, period\". Other reddit posters criticized the previous administration for deleting \"the_gottabear\" and added their own responses on the topic of fat positivity, the media's portrayal of obesity, and other issues.\n\nIt is not known if Reddit removed \"the_gottabear\" because he posted comments not approved of by the admins for content in the past.\n\n(Hat Tip: Reddit)",
    "To address the mental health discussion, I am going to mention my own struggles with anxiety, and post in my personal journal to see if anyone else is having these same thoughts. I know this is personal, and likely not the most appropriate way to discuss these matters, but I think it should be understood that for many people like me, getting through med school can be extremely tough, and some people seem to get stuck on a different path in the early stages. The truth is that many of us have serious mental health issues, and even the most healthy college graduates have problems that last throughout their lives. So if anyone is currently struggling or at risk for struggle, let's start a conversation about it, because it doesn't have to be like this. We can all do something about it.\n\nThe only thing I can say is you do not have to switch out of med school if you struggle with anxiety. The whole point of the program is to build the skills to become your own best doctor. Getting good at your medical education is not about how quickly you can skip a class. Your medical education will not get you a job in the system (at least, not to the level you would want). Your college education is your best way out the door. So what you need to do as a college student is realize that getting through the whole thing is going to be very challenging, and there's no \"one way\" to med school. The point when you make the change shouldn't be this: \"but I've already taken this 10 classes… and I should totally transition out.\" Everyone does it differently.\n\nThe important thing for you to realize first is that if you can't do a class, you shouldn't be taking up med school in the first place. The reason you took the classes is that you needed the skills to do medical school, not that you are going to need the same skills once you leave. This means that there is no \"right\" and \"wrong\" way to med school. Just because you've done one class this semester, does not mean that you should pick it up again and do it again next semester. You shouldn't take any more class because you are hoping that you will get an easy D next time (which you might). Med school is a lifelong journey. You'll want to continue to make sure that you are able to continue to stay",
    "Hi reddit, I'm a transgender woman of color. I've been living as a woman for eight years. The first time I told anyone I was trans was in college and, to be honest, it was my best friend who got ahold of me and made a quick decision to try to help me adjust to my new life. We spoke through the school's administration and, as things stood, it was a long, convoluted process that left me feeling trapped by a system that was very alien to me.\n\nOver the next four years, I was consistently harassed for being \"different\" and told that people's discomfort with my gender meant that they were actually afraid of me. I felt isolated socially. The university campus was so far from my home, far from my roots that I was regularly subjected to the indignities that are routinely meted out to minority students on our campuses. Though I made good grades, I never felt comfortable in school and often would sleep through classes. I experienced tremendous self-hatred. I often hated myself and wanted to die. And though I had great friends who supported me, I did not feel welcome on campus. I was rejected like this so many times in high school and colleges that it became my personal torture.\n\nEventually, this behavior escalated to stalking and attempted murder and eventually culminated in an attempt to end my own life. As a result of years of trauma, I'm now a victim of institutionalized oppression.\n the reason I feel like I'm a persecutor is that I've been arrested for it before. I was arrested by the police a few times in college. They were called and arrested because I was walking around campus with my phone, in violation of campus policies and, as I was informed by a campus cop, because somebody else in the dorm saw me and got scared and called the police on my behalf. I've spent the last couple years fighting for my release. I'm still waiting for a judge to finally take it upon himself to decide what this world has created for me and what kind of treatment I deserve. I've been through the process so many times that I'm beginning to feel the experience is repeating itself. I'm now taking an official leave of absence from the university.\n\nI'm posting this in response to a piece of public news I've read recently that I feel is grossly unfair. In my words",
    "It's been two days since I turned in my milk, and I still haven't had a glass of water in the whole week. When I woke up this morning my body was aching. My muscles felt like a pair of rocks glued together with only one end stuck out at an angle. I could feel my muscles, bones, and organs screaming at me to stop. I thought my body had literally just given up and was now a pile of fleshy parts. I sat there rubbing my eyes trying to look through cloudy tears. I looked in the mirror and to my surprise I looked like a zombie. My body wasn't even that sore. I felt the most sore muscles in my neck, shoulders, chest, and back. I took the bottle to the bathroom to start the cleaning process. That's when I realized milk is made of protein. It's my body's way of telling me that my body needs to regroup. My stomach grew tight, but I kept drinking. I took a bottle of ibuprofen and mixed it with a glass of water to see what it would do... Well, it made the milk go down. My milk supply dropped significantly and I was left on the floor of my shower for half an hour, trying to catch my breath. I washed up without any milk, and the first thing I did was take three ibuprofen tablets and started taking a nap. I am still having a little trouble sleeping. I can't seem to fall asleep, but I'm not sure why it is. I think what I am experiencing is simply the effect of that third bottle of ibuprofen on my stomach. I think that all 3 doses of ibuprofen I drank just took some of the placebo effect away.\n\nI'm going to stick with the assumption that ibuprofen doesn't actually work, so my only hope is that even if it is a placebo effect, a woman can simply wait until she is finished breastfeeding and feel as though she is losing some milk. Or she can go pee! (Not that I recommend that!)\n\nMore of Breastfeeding & Pee:",

    "I am going to write this from my own perspective, to let folks know what has happened to me since I told my story of being duped by DFV. I have never told this story to any news organizations, because I think it's horrible, and I'm afraid if the right people found out, they would make fun of me and what happened to me. I have not been told how many shares I have lost, but I have done my best to estimate it by knowing I sold some \"hot\". This is my story. I think I can give a reasonable amount for how my life has changed since I sold those \"hot\". It sounds crazy when you read it, but people have treated me very differently. I am still relatively in the \"low-mid\" category of my own life. I lost my job in April and I had trouble making up for lost pay during the last few months of unemployment. The biggest problem I have is in my relationship. My ex is still good friends with my ex-wife (who I had split from shortly after I received the letter), and I want to keep the relationship with her. I am also still friends with the couple who told us about the scam when we first found out, to be honest. So, these are the big problems I have with the world. One of my best friends who is a lawyer has told me he has just started looking into some kind of legal action against DFV. I would also like to tell people that I have been approached by friends and family and other investors asking for money to help with my loss. We will see where this takes me. Now, the main reason I'm writing this post, is to just tell people that if a few people can make the connection, and if people who get to learn the truth can do anything they need to do, then I hope to be able to get a good amount of money to my victims just as much as any legitimate investor would. So that they can get back what they deserve, and make things easier on someone who honestly felt duped.\n\nIt's obvious from this post that while it was difficult for him, it was really hard for his family. The family was going through something like this. They lost everything to this story. But I am happy to report that they have all said that they are making good progress with the legal process. However, to hear that",
    "I was running with some friends when a guy came up behind us and we thought it was part of the gang so we ran over to him and kicked him in the balls. His friend jumped in though, and the guy who stepped up for him accidentally shot him at point blank range. I was running up behind the guy with the sidearm in a \"stand down\" stance at the time. As I shot, it didn’t go off and I looked down. I could see the blood on the barrel of the gun and I knew it would go off if I shot, so I stopped. We ran home and called our parents. One of them stayed out until we were out and the other one stayed outside. I wasn’t the kind of guy who was going to be scared by a gun or whatnot so I just told them that I accidentally shot a guy. They were very supportive and told me that it was nothing to be ashamed of or think about. So here we are 7 years later, the person I accidentally shot got divorced, married, and has two kids. I'm still the same person, I'm just thankful no one got hurt.\n\nMy friends and I have been discussing it for a while now and to be honest, every new conversation that comes up with firearms comes back to the same one person: a guy who accidentally shot a guy at range.\n\nWhy did it happen exactly that way? I don't know. Maybe he had a really bad day or couldn't keep his cool.\n\nAt first, I assumed it was some kind of a joke that I just had to laugh about and didn't want to let anyone else ever worry about getting in to the same position.\n\nBut it's not like I can leave it at that.\n\nIt is not something that a single person's life needs to be affected by this. I don't think anyone would get shot if a single guy got into a spot where a bunch were shooting at them and all of them are shooting to protect themselves. But the majority of the people that use firearms at a shooting range are there so that their friend can feel confident about shooting at them and the odds are they were just going to fire anyway, probably even expecting to get",
    "I'm sure a sizable chunk of you are still holding onto that feeling of \"what the fuck?? I don't like my husband at all now!!\" The good news: this was the exact opposite. There was a definite connection between just being with someone, and feeling better. We even noticed the difference in our sex lives, when we were not as intimate with our spouses. So now what? We're still engaged. Well, he is. This is our first time being in an open relationship, and it's kind of nice to actually be with someone instead of hiding away as much in the dark as we are in public. For the rest of your relationship, I wouldn't bother opening up to them, but you may want to for the rest of your marriage, just to really \"feel better\".\n\nAs you can see, it appears that the person writing the post was in a monogamous relationship, and said, \"I know it sounds silly and I know that it sounds immature and I know they are probably jealous and it just sounds like a bunch of hooey to you, but it is real. I have nothing to worry about.\"\n\nThe thing about how couples communicate with each other is that when monogamous couples have an open relationship or have open communication, they don't need to be completely frank with each other, even just because they are engaged. It's much the same as if they are married, and want to have sex with someone but are trying to be discreet with respect to not coming across as cheating. They have sex with each other and don't want to give their spouse any clues whatsoever about what's going on.\n\nNow, as to what this post is about: My husband and I are engaged once again. However, since we've been going strong, I believe the \"better the feeling, the better the action\" hypothesis has been invalidated. That said, I want to use my experience to help other couples.\n\nIt all started last year, when my wife told me that if I went out with someone, that I needed to be very specific about who he was, when we did it, and when he wouldn't be coming around again. He told us that we ought to keep in touch by exchanging gifts, by having some form of communication, and I had no problem with that.\n\nBut then the next",
    "So here's a little experiment. You know how if you install an app or piece of software, it takes you to that same app/software's page, where you could potentially click Buy Now? Well, instead of that I'll ask you to type a few commands on your terminal.\n\nInstall a program! If you can't install a program, type sudo apt-get install <program>\n\nIf you cannot get the \"Install this program\" notification, then type sudo apt-get remove <program> to remove the program.\n\n(NOTE: If you tried the previous version and it still didn't work, please update your system. This may have affected something important.)\n\nLet's take this idea one step further: I downloaded my package of software on the internet. How do I run the program? Type apt-get install <program>\n\nDid you get an error? If so, then use sudo apt-get remove <program> to remove the program.\n\nIf nothing happened when you executed the command, try another package.\n\nDid you get a message or something in your error output? If so, please type sudo apt-get search <package> to search for the package.\n\nFinally, did you actually install the program? If you installed a package, type sudo apt-get --purge install <package> to remove the program's package.\n\nThe above commands should give you the basic idea of how this works. It's a program called 'apt' that installs any program or app, on your system, based on what you entered in the terminal. The above commands should give you the basic idea of how this works. Well, this got a little out of hand from going through each step for each program. So I made a little program to just help you run each command automatically.

    "First though, you should note that this is strictly a personal view—and an opinion, based solely on my limited playtime with Draven. Second, I'm not implying that all Draven players are bad players. I'm only addressing the fact that, on a very-high-level level, he seems to be a very strong-performing character at a very-high-level play scene (just because I enjoy playing him doesn't mean that those of you who don't are necessarily doing so as a matter of preference, or as a mistake). Finally, there are a lot of factors that go into the success of a character, both as a solo player (and more so) and as a team-mate. I suspect that Draven is, at a very-high-level, one of the top two or three AD carries in all of LoL and the third-best at a relatively-low level. I also suspect that Draven players are, on average, much stronger for reasons other than just skill—and possibly very, very good players as well. With that in mind, let's take a look at the data we have, and what it tells us about the players who are performing so very well. Keep in mind that there will undoubtedly be some variables that make this data incomplete. In addition to this, this is just one slice of the whole issue, and I don't think this is the most representative slice of the whole issue. So, without further adeiu, here are a few questions and my answers: Which player, if any, are you, as a player, most often rooting for? This is a good question—because, as a player, I'm almost always rooting for Draven. Maybe only for the other team. Why? Because he's fun. And because this is a fun game that requires good tactical control, you are forced to prioritize player-skill over other features in order to win games. But what about that team mate you want? If you want the other team to do better, would you pick a champion and role who would make it easier to make them do better? Or would you rather have a champion who would not make you worse? Or vice versa? We can find out something important, then, about players on both sides of the divide. In which case, on average, you're probably doing better with the champion",

    "I've been thinking a lot about what the definition of a relationship is and what kind of people I want my relationship and relationships to be. I know I've said that I don't want to be with people who aren't \"true\". But how did I come to this realization? My first thought was from an abusive relationship. I had been in and out of dating relationships since I was 18 years old, and I was very open about it because I was still in and out of relationships myself; I'm 32 now! Sometimes, however, I found myself wanting to be in new and exciting relationships. My first thought about these was all negative because I found myself thinking, \"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm in a bad relationship so I know it's not going to be a long-term thing.\"\n\nAfter years of not looking back and trying to look forward, I did a little research and found that these ideas had been discussed before in the LGBT community from the gay \"community\":\n\nBisexuals and their partners want people who think alike, like them, are good people, have respect and trust them. Being bisexual also suggests that you can love and date anyone you want and still think of yourself as an outsider, like you're somehow \"less than\" because of it.\n\nWhat I realized then are the reasons why I really don't want to find out my partner is bisexual, are the reasons why my partner should think more about the person first before me, why someone may have to be the recipient of an \"I love you\", and is there a reason in a relationship I don't think I would be together with who I would want to be in a relationship.\n\nMy bisexual partner wants to stay in this relationship because she just loves me and wants to be with and support me while I am bisexual. Now I know she doesn't want to date another couple simply because a relationship can be a long-term thing. She wants to live forever. Of course she wants to be with me, she just does not want to date another lesbian because then I will never find that person I fall in love with. (I might die first.) Being with me is her top priority while I am with all of the lesbians.\n\nI'm not saying I don't like lesbian relationships. A lot of us do. I also don't hate bisexuals. I'll admit",
    "Well, after reading a bit more of the problem and trying to figure out my exact issue I decided to check my 'trunk' wiring for a possible root cause. The only possible problem I have found is the fact that something failed to heat up properly in the fuse panel from the wiring harness (I had tried using a thermal fuse on the panel but it failed to get high enough). If that is the problem I'll just have to remove the fuse and it's good again.\n\nThe only thing I'm concerned about now is the light bulb. When I first installed the light, I had the bulb mounted over a few inches from the ground, but with the light now attached I have the bulb mounted the correct distance away from me – 1.75″. While the 'new' electrical system (the one that I was using at the time) did produce more heat (due to the extra wiring) than the previous electrical system, I can't say if the heat related issues were due to the mounting or if the heat issue was also caused by the mounting of the bulb. There must be something on my end of this.\n\nUpdate – 10:40 a.m. Eastern, 4/29/2010\n\nI discovered a more clear and less expensive'replica' bulb that I've used with this lighting module for a couple weeks now. I used this bulb in addition to the other replacement bulbs that I purchased from Amazon for $7.99 each (which are still in perfect working condition, with the addition of the light bulb).\n\nSince my light bulb is mounted right over the electrical wiring, it's a little more difficult for the light bulb socket to get enough voltage to begin the power to the actual bulb, the socket. However, it did get enough voltage, and even though the bulb itself didn't work correctly it still worked without burning out or anything else terribly wrong. I did this as a safety precaution until I got a repair kit for the socket that I plan on using.\n\nI think I've reached a point where I'd rather try to figure out what went wrong with the original 'trunk' system and a possible cause for the electrical issues than to attempt to work around the problem myself. I've used the same exact wiring (and socket) for about a month now, and am looking forward to trying the new bulbs.\n\nUpdate – 4",
    "In the last decade, the growth of the \"data mining\" industry has resulted in a large number of software packages and solutions that aim to automate the job of mining high-dimensional data and create reports.\n\nOne of the most popular and prominent are SPSS for Microsoft Excel and R for Unix/Linux. These are good candidates for anomaly detection in anomaly handling as they take advantage of machine learning to solve the problem. One of the reasons for using anomaly detection software was the huge amount of datasets being created. The availability of such data has given rise to many tools for the task, including SPSS and the more recent variant called SPMD. Here is a simplified example using this method:\n\nWhen we have an anomaly on a website we often know that it was created in a specific year. The problem is that we have never seen something like this, and probably never will. Most of the reports are produced on an annual period (yearly, quarterly, monthly, etc.). That is what makes use of anomaly detection so useful (we can expect more anomalies in the future!). However, what if, when the report is generated, we are interested in the period before that anomaly appeared? In such cases (if we can control the length of time in which the report will be generated), using machine learning to determine if this is a real situation or just one that was created later can be quite a useful tool.\n\nIn this post I want to illustrate how we can use anomaly detection to build a tool that can help us detect when anomalies appear in the data we have available. I will use data extracted from various commercial datasets to accomplish the task and use a real example of a business and its data to illustrate what I mean by \"a good light weight automatic\". In particular, I will focus on a model that was proposed by a group of researchers (S. F. Reis, P. Hahn). The paper called \"Machine Learning for anomaly detection and detection of anomaly-induced artifacts\" [pdf] has many good figures that might actually interest you. I will also try to illustrate one practical example of using machine learning to identify anomalies [pdf].\n\nOur problem\n\nThe scenario is simple: we have an inventory of products and we would like to show it as a picture on a desktop, so that customers can quickly identify the most recent order. In other words,",
    "\"I'm a full time student and as a result I work a huge amount during the school year (30-40 hours a week) and a smaller amount during summer break (4-5 hours a week). I still do some freelancing at the end of the work week but mostly I am left trying to make ends meet.\n\nFor my school I have a flexible job system including overtime, and a paid health insurance as well as a \"student loan\" that I borrow money from my parents. I live with my parents but they have always been extremely supportive and invested in me. My parents are older and have always encouraged my career advancement as young adults.\n\nThese facts aside, the only reason I don't have my own apartment as well is because I've never owned one. I never know where to turn if I get in an accident or have a financial crisis. My parents pay most of my bills, but unfortunately I haven't earned enough to pay them back. What makes this even more tragic is that I am living in one of the most expensive cities in the world and my parents are paying the bills out of their own pocket as well.\n\nI'm currently thinking about canceling my college plans and leaving school altogether altogether until I can afford a place myself.\n\nI am currently not using any of my income to pay bills right now so I'm going through credit card debt to keep up with these bills. My situation is a little bit different from the vast majority of people (since I have to deal with the debt in my own house and I am not going broke on my wages) but it still feels like this has been the standard situation for me for all my life.\n\nWhen I try to justify my lack of self-sufficiency, I always try to make the argument that I worked my ass off for years as an engineer getting advanced degrees, working 80 hours a week, and now I should have the luxury of owning a house on my own. However, while I worked hard to get where I am, I don't see how owning a house is the solution to the problems that face me.

Many times, men have a similar situation to mine when they are first starting out and don't know any better, but this",
    "I had my rMA (replacement) card for a little over 7 months. Here are my findings...\n\nRMA's have become more and more common now. For the last 3+ years my card has been used almost daily for graphics/gaming. At first I considered it to be a great and quiet card. And after using it and doing some benchmarks I would agree with that. Even compared against my GTX 560 it performs pretty closely. After a few days I noticed something strange. My PC would get really hot or at least I assumed so. I had to run a fan to cool the whole system. Then my card started losing battery life. I checked the back of my card and the fans (which seem to be very similar to the CPU fans in your CPU) were being kept at 60-70% and even when i left the system on, they were only running about 20% with the GPU loaded. Now, i had another card that had about 6 months of use with it and it never had a problem.\n\nAfter going online and doing some research I found that rma's were becoming a common issue. I tried to tell all of us here at GTR that GPUs were unstable and that it might be best to keep them in stock for such things. It is understandable then that you would want to purchase a new card that can handle the task. And that is indeed what people do...until it doesn't. Well, it can work out, but it did not...until this issue occurred.\n\nUpon replacing the card it began to perform much better and lasted for about 2 weeks. Then the voltage dropped again. It was around 30 - 41volts. Then I noticed that it had increased my RAM as well as my USB speeds while it was on. The fans would not run at full speed when the card was off. I eventually had to turn the fans off to shut the system down. It then came to me. I knew that I didn't have the power cord on for that to work (or ever) and that was an additional issue. However, the memory was completely stable and even improved when it was off. I had no issue with either of these issues after having it on most of the time. And even at high temperatures, the memory would have been able to maintain at least 90% of its original performance. I thought that was odd",
    "[I]'ve had it up to here. I've been at one place for 7 years and am frustrated at how much of a waste my job is. I decided to write up this post to give others a heads up before transitioning. First, get some stuff out of the way. A job is a product of many decisions and choices made within the past, present, or future context of the employees. The workplace should be a place of socializing, creativity, and fun, but it should have a certain purpose. In the beginning, the purpose for a job wasn't always clear. Jobs were usually things that would allow you to create a new life for yourself. It's the reason that you found yourself in the position in the first place for the reasons of money. In the end, it shouldn't matter if you're a business owner or just a casual employee. It's just a job and a reason given to the world to move forward and continue living life. As these jobs have more and more responsibilities/limitations imposed on them, it has become a place where you spend most of your time doing things that are not directly related to the original purpose. In theory, this may not be a bad thing. It might allow you to focus all of your energy on one specific field and allow you to focus more on that. However, in the context of modern society, it probably isn't a good idea. Work used to give you all sorts of opportunities. A job that is tied to your company, or any company for that matter, may be one of these. However, the majority of companies are now run by managers. They don't necessarily have any idea what you want to work on, or how to properly direct you towards it. They often don't have a reason for you to come in every day anymore, and most of these employees are looking for a fun way to pass the time. As such, there is less of a reason to keep coming in most days, or to get to know the new person on the other end of the counter. When you are in this position, it is hard to get the opportunity to do something with them, and a job offers very little in return. When you leave, what is left is usually what they want. The only people that will get that are likely people who have been there awhile or don't have much work of their own",
    "I'm just going to add my own experience. I've met the roommate that I was with while we both came to UT from out of state and he was living in the same apartment building. I'd walked past that building a few times and I said hello when I saw him and he shook my hand. We sat on a couch for an hour, laughing and talking. I walked into my room and turned on the TV to see him coming from the kitchen. He opened the door and came in as I was getting ready. We sat down. I sat down next to him. His body language, his voice, things were so natural when we talked. He put his hand on my knee to tell me I should be proud of it being so close to him, he thanked me for my smile and asked if he could use my toothbrush. The situation was perfect. That's just how we met.\n\nHe made a few comments about my teeth, and my smile. He was saying he was in the bathroom when I had my last brushing/shaving session. I told him about doing it before and was like \"You're in the toilet a lot\". He laughed, and then told me that he gets a really good feeling when it's done right in the toilet.\n\nThen he started talking about having girls coming by his place that he wanted to have sex with. At this point, my curiosity got the best of me. I asked him if he could tell me what the girls would be wearing, if they knew he was going to be there. He said no, that they'd just be checking for my car. I asked him who it was he was doing it with, and he said it was with a girl he knew at the apartment who was from out of state. His name was Sean and Sean was going to go back to her hometown to visit her mom. He kept saying Sean and his friend liked me and what a nice guy I was, and how there was someone new that I had never met.\n\nI was just trying to figure out what to do. In trying to figure out what to do, I became nervous so I walked out and asked him if there were girls and guys like that. He said no, only girls.

    "I do a LOT of weight lifting. I'm not the strongest, but I train hard. I've tried a dozen different cycles of squatting, deadlifting, benching and pressing. I always end up getting stronger! So I was thinking, why does a 15 week cycle of 5/3/1/2/1/push and pull work so well? Is it some specific programming, is it the weights, or, is it conditioning? I was thinking of trying a week-long cycle, but then if I do it too long that becomes boring. I know there are many cycles of 5/3/1 that work, so I was wondering what other variations would work best for me as I'm not at the level of those in training, and am not into pushing weights or benching very hard. Thank you\n\nIt is quite often asked if a 5/3/1 cycle can be used for a long-term training program. The short answer is always \"It depends\" The most fundamental question about the use of 5 / 3 / 1 in training is whether the cycle is too long. If the program is too long you will not be seeing the results. On the other hand, if the program is just right you will definitely be seeing results. As I told the readers here in one of my previous entries for this site, I have been using a 5 / 3 / 1 training cycle for a while now and have yet to see a drop off in results. Also keep in mind that a 2-3 week pause cycle is typically shorter than what I recommend here. In fact, the program I run for the majority of a client's program can be broken down to a 2 or 4 week pause cycle and would work well for most people. Keep this in mind when you see the \"5 / 3 / 1\" listed on the box. In my experience when looking at lifters using the program there is a tendency to be impatient and want to get results right away. What you need to understand is that progress in most lifts is gradual rather than instant. You will need to train for a period of time in a certain manner before reaching your limits. At that point it is best to reduce volume in order to train at a safe level.\n\nWhen used as a long-term training program the 5:3:1 ratio actually works great for those that have been training",
    "So yesterday, we made an announcement that V.A.T.S would be going offline. This decision was made because we wanted to find a way to fix the issue without doing a full reset of the game. Due to the massive number of issues we're currently facing, I want to start by apologizing for how this has been received by the gaming community, and to ask for your patience as we work through this issue. We're committed to making sure the fix is as seamless as possible for everyone.\n\nAfter playing around in the game's console menu for a while today, I've been able to figure out the cause of the crash. Basically, it comes down to a lack of CPU and GPU power in certain areas of the game engine. Specifically, you are not able to utilize V.A.T.S. with a crossbow. I've put together a new post detailing the specifics of how exactly we are addressing the issue.\n\nFirst, we're going to be disabling crossbows completely from the console. This will take some time as we need to find a better way to accomplish this with the new API API that we release to the public in the near future. We also know that there is a lot of frustration with the crossbow being disabled and there was a lot of discussion about it even on this forum, so I'll go ahead and direct people here to our announcement from yesterday on its removal from gameplay:\n\nWe found that the crossbow's performance was too inconsistent and the current solution does not work in most cases. In our latest update, we're reducing the crossbow's impact on FPS levels and balancing the skill gain with the weapon's power curve. This should result in much better balance and allow for much higher power with the crossbow.\n\nNow that the crossbow is disabled in combat for a while, we're going to find a better way to utilize the crossbow. We'll continue to try to improve Crossbow Sprint by buffing a few of its key attributes such as damage and Sprint speed. Additionally, we are going to try to find better ways to utilize the crossbow skill trees with perks and perksets.\n\nWe know this has taken a bit of time, but we understand how frustrating this decision has been to people on the forums, and are working very hard to deliver a stable and bug-free experience.

    "Hi! I recently received a gift from my girlfriend which made me feel uncomfortable. The gift itself wasn't particularly unusual or particularly objectionable, just a little out of the ordinary. However, what occurred to me after receiving it was that there wasn't anything wrong with it that I hadn't just noticed, and that what was odd about it was that I had an uneasy feeling about it from the beginning. I've already read some of the comments on that post, with some people saying that it was not inappropriate, but I think that's a really important question to ask. It's okay to give something a second look, but I want you to know that your feeling about something doesn't have to be true. The whole situation was probably off-putting to her as well, as is my feeling about it. So... what should I do? Should I think twice before gifting things to people, or just accept them and move on? Or do I have to have a conversation about the gift with my girlfriend and be sure about all of my assumptions BEFORE I say so out loud? Maybe I should ask my girlfriend what she thought about it? I don't want to sound judgmental or anything, but I just don't know what to do. Thanks in advance for your help! -kim",

He got a huge surprise in his Horadric Cube.\n\nHere's the full post in bold and formatted with my comments bolded:\n\nHey Reddit!\n\nThis is a huge surprise for me... I stumbled upon an amazing post from redditor mopz from a few months ago. He got a huge surprise in his Horadric Cube.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Reddit, and I love being able to share secrets with the community. I wanted to thank u/mopz for being so amazing!\n\nI found out this week through a Horadric Cube tutorial by Hjak on Reddit that he had a set of items and a cube combination. This combo was incredibly good, but I never knew that there is a \"Perfect\" combo in the cube!\n\nFor reference, you can use the link to enter into the Horadric Cube. Just replace your items and get to the \"cube combo\" screen!\n\nThe combo itself was perfect: The item I had was Skull of Corruption, the legendary item. I used its unique item bonus on another one and got a Skull of Corruption. I got Stone of Jordan in the cube, and my reward for that was a Tear of Jordan.\n\nThe next challenge was to obtain a perfect skull and piece. I took a chance and tried to get a Skull of Corruption and the Tear of Jordan without luck.\n\nI took it upon myself to do what everyone has dreamed about doing: Find the Perfect Skull from a 3x3 section.

    "Awhile ago, another user was banned for using the bug, which could also be used by players to perform server-side tricks. The admin for both the original reddit post as well as the DZ forum thread has stated that the problem does not affect the ability to use other bugs. These exploits, however, can be used if one can find an exploit for the target system.\n\n\nI have also had it confirmed that other exploits used to \"lock\" or prevent players from playing from their main account are not affected. These exploits however, can also be used if a player can find an exploit to a server-side issue that is not connected to either cheating or bugs. For example, a player who is playing on a server, but can't access the server map might not have time to use a cheat on the server then, if one found a way to get their main account into the server and get it running there, the main account could easily be used to gain map control without having the map as an option.\n\n\nIt is not clear as to what the current plan is to make exploit tools usable for servers. I have been told that the tools will become available only for those who request to be able to use them, and that they will not be available for free or at any charge. I am currently in negotiations with a developer of the tools on how these tools will go beyond the current scope for use.\n\n\nA list of the various exploits used are contained in the OP of this thread - http://i.imgur.com/V8qE8Dy.png - including a list of exploits which are already working and a list of other exploits which are working, but not implemented yet.",
    "I am a 24 year old guy. Before I started reddit, I felt like I was unable to talk about my feelings freely. My mom and my brother think I'm weird because I still haven't gone through puberty. However, I know that at some point I'm going to have a girlfriend and it would be a shame to ruin that because of a sexual assault. I have talked to many guys about it. However, I had never shared anything about it with female partners because I was embarrassed, I didn't want them to be jealous of my experience, and they wouldn't be very interested in it. I have no idea what could change that. Any advice?\n\nI think that this is a problem that is being ignored by many people. Sexual assaulters aren't a \"little person.\" They aren't kids. They are adults. They are grown men that have the right to do what they want with someone's body. When an adult rapist makes it known that he would like to have sex with you, it causes a lot of pain for both parties involved. It hurts because you are telling him that he doesn't have to respect your boundaries, it hurts because he is going to hurt you and hurt yourself if he does not respect your limits, and it hurts because you have to let him know that he is the only person in your life who has a right to have access to the parts of your body that you care about.\n\nThe best thing you can do right at this point is tell your partner what has happened to you and that you want the attacker to stop. If that doesn't work, you can tell him to leave you alone or to get help and talk with someone. You wouldn't give a dog a treat if he did something bad to you. If his behavior doesn't change, he is going to have to leave. Be considerate and gentle with him.\n\nThe last thing you can do is act like you are brokenhearted or that you're over it because after everything that's happened you've learned to love people. Everyone makes mistakes. Most of them look stupid and embarrassing initially but they get better. Sometimes they actually do. Don't let someone take you down when you're actually doing what you think is best in this situation. Don't let your own insecurities get in the way of being strong and self-aware about your situation",
    "Hello. I'm the author of this piece and want to explain that it was actually never intended for this particular friend of mine. I've known her for a few years and as you probably know, I'm a fairly vocal supporter of psychiatry in general, in particular psychiatry's use of psychotropics on the mentally ill. Basically, this is why I was so upset to see that her friend was posting my pieces on reddit's psychiatry sub on her thread titled \"I've had it with depression.\" She found my article on bipolar and BPD and thought it might relate to her friend.\n\nThe topic is a very important one to me as I've personally experienced both and have been in therapy for depression since I was twelve. I was in therapy for about 18 months and it was a great start. But I'm going to try to shed a little light on my own experience and why I think it was such a mistake for her to post it on such a controversial thread.\n\nI know I sound like I'm complaining or fighting the establishment or the system but I have to share this because it's so much of what I've learned. And I believe that everyone reading this might learn something and if you're depressed, you might feel a little less alone on this planet.\n\nI was raised by an alcoholic and borderline-dependent parent who had always lied to me about what he was dealing with. He would lie or be dishonest about things for various \"motivational\" reasons but I've also always known he was a borderline-bipolar when he was off his meds. He could be very charming and persuasive, like when he would put me down and make me think that his family was not just \"bad\" but also \"evil.\"\n\nSo yeah, I have this knowledge of BPD right at this point. And I don't know a lot about psychotropic drugs I think it's time for us to do our own research into it because I don't want to be one of those who says, \"I have this knowledge and I'm not worried about it.\"\n\nI've been on psychotropic drug for a long time, maybe 25 years or so now. I'm a major heavy user now – I can't stop taking them because there's so much improvement to be had. The improvement is incredible. I'm still very much dependent though, both",
    "There are different ways you can handle a gunfight. A good way is to get under the guy and keep your face and hands to cover his face and arms, so that it looks as if whatever is going on in the head is coming towards you. However, this doesn't always work. If he does decide that he wants a fight, then he needs to let you know a few seconds before it happens. This is why there are a million different kinds of training plans, and this is where this post comes in... Let's say you get called to deal with a guy like this... He's a big time gangbanger and your job is to keep him under control. He wants to fight, but doesn't want to let you handle that situation. What you would do is either keep him under control as best you can or deal with him. So what would you do?\n\nWell, this is really a question of tactics. What kind of tactics is best for you? You want to deal with a guy like this as quickly as possible, while keeping your body and mind working on protecting yourself.\n\nObviously, if you had to deal with one of these guys on a day to day basis, you would always try to protect yourself first. That would be your first priority. You wouldn't let him get you in trouble so you could get him.\n\nHowever, you need to know if you can take a chance and deal with him first. You want to be in that situation when he really wants to fight and that can happen anywhere, so you can either try to protect yourself first and hopefully distract him or you can try to deal with him first and hope you get more control than you would with a simple knock-down or submission...\n\nHow to deal after having to deal with a shoot out\n\nA couple things to consider when dealing with a shoot out:\n\n- If you have a gun you will always have a strong chance to shoot the aggressor, because it will stop him for good, or at least get him where he can't hurt or kill you\n\n- If there is still a chance he will hit you in the face or you will get a face full of hot lead, run in your door and use the toilet as a cover.

    "Being a child is hard enough; growing up, however, was way worse. My parents' divorce was rough on me – they were both on top of the world, loved by millions, and I was the only one for whom they had never disappointed in any way. Well, almost. I went to my first punk rock show once and I cried every time I walked in. There's nothing better for somebody having lost their parents to show them love and affection than seeing a bunch of kids in their teens or twenties dancing to some shitty music you never cared about as a kid. My parents divorced, the kids from my previous relationship broke up with me, and I couldn't afford to go to college. None of this would have mattered if only these kids had found it in themselves to like me! If only they had found some people who cared about them and who were decent members of society (just like me). But all I ever got was that one dumb crush, and I was trapped within my emotional armor that was my life (read: \"I'm pretty but not a great person\").\n\nI am not a young adult. I am an extremely shy and awkward kid who is not great at many things (including making friends, making good decisions, or even doing well in school). I am not very good at dating, or getting laid, or being a friend. This is the reality of growing up in this country. That's bad enough so I don't really want to get into what I am good at besides the occasional high-five and a hug.\n\nThere are certain things you don't learn at school: you learned that your parents were both awful, you learned that you didn't deserve your parents, and you learned that you didn't know how to do everything on your own. This made me feel like a worthless worthless loser because I never had an opportunity to prove to people I was good enough not just to my friends, but to people who I was supposed to idolize.\n\nI feel like I have been in this world for too long and I don't think society would like me that much if they knew how lonely and horrible my current existence is going to be when you get to your 40s and 50s. I don't think any society that values people's lives would want to keep me around and I don't think I want to be a member of that",

Personally, I like Invoker better than he was after the patch, even though some other people disagree and feel he's more powerful.\n\nAlso, it's interesting to see that both Shadow Fiend and Dark Seer are among the top 3 (or 4) heroes of the mid lane. What it means is: they're all good picks, but many people are scared of picking them because they want a different lineup, but Dark Seer doesn't make the cut because he's not popular among the average player. I feel it's the same with Shadow Fiend. I think he's overrated and some people dislike him. I think he can be good, but he can also be banned out.\n\nFinally, this shows that the most popular picks in the beta are generally still good. Only Bloodseeker, Luna, and Treant Protector are outclassed in their own way. The only bad ones are Lifestealer and Invoker. It's interesting to see that the heroes that are considered \"safe\" aren't being picked that much now because it's hard to get the right lineup before level 8. I wonder what the future holds for heroes like these. But they're still good!\n\nLet me know what you think and whether you would vote for one of those choices. Any thoughts",
    "I'm a 24-year-old female college student, currently studying Computer Science at University of Iowa. I've been having a rough time with my boyfriend of two years — his name is Tom — for quite some time now. He's an absolutely incredible man, and I've known him since we were 16. A few weeks ago, we went to a concert together. I knew not to go home, because he had a date with me at the concert. The night felt surreal — he was my first boyfriend in a few years, and my last. We were walking back to campus together on campus when the whole incident played out. I was walking with Tom when a man walked out from behind a dumpster near us, and began yelling racial slurs. The guy was about 6 feet taller than me, muscular, with a goatee beard and tattoos on both of his arms. I didn't know who this man was, but was certain it was someone I knew (it wasn't). Before I could register any of what he said, he walked up directly beside me and punched an unconscious Tom in his eye. At first, I couldn't tell if Tom had just been punched or had fallen to the ground — as many times as I heard Tom yell \"Help!\" during the incident, I assumed he had just fallen off balance. I couldn't see if Tom was unconscious, though, so I just stood there and watched as the man continued to punch Tom. That's when Tom said \"Help!\", something I only ever imagined him saying during a fight. As I watched Tom's eyes rolling back in his head with blood rushing out of his face, I remember thinking, \"What am I going to do? This guy is pretty big. Maybe I should just run away?\" I quickly ran out of the dumpster and got on my bike. Luckily, I saw some other people there on bikes, who were also in a rush. We all rode to UIW and told someone who was running a tri-campus dormitory that we needed help. As he was leaving with his friends, this friend of his was walking by and thought no one needed help, so he continued walking. As Tom sat up, he said \"That's it. That's just how racism works,\" meaning that when you are physically attacked over and over again, you start to believe it. I don't know if this was true, but",

    "There is also a very nice article from Polygon in 2015:But the internet is full of things like this:And this:So people are selling things they don't even own. But hey, at least these people are honest about it!I've never been in the habit of selling anything I own, but I will try this out. I like collecting classic (e.g. NES, SNES, NES Pro) and original (e.g. SNES, Sega Genesis) games. So as far as gaming goes, I should be able to find a few things that might sell for a reasonable price.But this is going to be difficult, mainly because I have no way of selling my collection except selling it on eBay for real money. Also, I like not caring about money in a game and that's all I care about.But this is fun, a way to help get rid (at least for a few months at least) of my collection and maybe even turn some profit.Maybe there's some other stuff out there for free, but I'm pretty sure I can't find any in the game. If I had to guess, I'd guess that either the NES is only $75, or Sega Genesis is only $50, or Sega Master System is only $50, or at the very least the Gamecube is probably $50.With a million games, I'd figure that somewhere between $50 and $75 is the median price (e.g. I probably could find a $20 NES for $50 plus S$60 for shipping, or a $20 Sega Genesis for the same price).So with that in mind, here are some things that might sell for a reasonable price. I'd pay $75 for all of them on eBay:This is from the 80s! For $75, you could buy all of these from eBay:And I'm sure someone else probably already has some of these already. These are some of my favorites. This game was originally $25, but people have offered me $10 for it in the past. I don't think I could afford to sell this one, so it will stay in the game. This one from 1983 still costs money to buy, but maybe someone would be willing to pay $25 for it.This SNES game I got for free from my grandfather for Christmas was $40 in 1996, which",
    "http://www.reddit.com/r/thedickshow/comments/24rj0v/huffy_torex_gearbox_broke/\n\nI'm posting this because I'm concerned for what a broken gearbox could turn into in a crash. This happens once every few years. The gearbox seems to fall off very easily and is easy for the driver to pick up.\n\nI have been a Honda owner since 2006. My last car was a 9 year old Accord which was a great motor and drove well until my car broke down at around 60,000 miles. My mechanic fixed it. It has run ever since, mostly well, but I haven't had a chance to drive it.\n\nThe most obvious symptom was that we had a tendency of the gas and motor would get hot. Our car's electric fan wouldn't work and the only time we could get cool air out of the car with the air conditioner on was when we got a slight breeze and it blew cool air into the car. The car would stay in park without moving from then on. The car was hot.\n\nThe problem started a couple of months ago. My wife had a problem with her car's exhaust. She had the head and the mufflers replaced and had a new exhaust manifold installed. The engine would smoke, the engine would stall.\n\nMy mechanic didn't have a new gearbox, just a new rear end, he said this is normal for cars over 10 years old. At first, I was a little suspicious about what we would discover when we turned the engine loose and started driving.\n\nAnd just what happened? The car stalled like a bad car. It took forever to get going and would only move down hill into gear. I looked through the owner's manual and discovered something interesting.\n\nHere's an excerpt from a page called \"The Honda Parts Manual\"\n\nHonda Parts Manual - The Honda Parts Manual includes parts for the motor, transmission, clutch, and differential, including the transmission bearing cooler.\n\n(This is a complete part list, for anyone that's curious)\n\nHere's some background:\n\nI know that one of the biggest complaints people have about Hondas is because of the gears.

    "I just noticed that /r/KotakuInAction was all about an ex-googler's revenge against a woman he worked with. And how \"SJWs\" were involved. This is not the first time a subreddit I moderate had been overrun with people saying this stuff but the pattern continued. Not long after it was brought to my attention a moderator from that subreddit (which is a non-SJW sub but is populated by that crowd) was banned from KotakuInAction and /r/KotakuInAction. So now I don't really want to deal with this shit, since I can't trust a moderator. Maybe I am just too weak, or I should just stop participating in a sub I used to moderate. I don't know. I should probably just stop moderating in general because then I won't have anything to lose. But I am a moderator and I can't let people just do what they want. The thread was posted by /u/FempireDude who said, among other things, that it was only a matter of time before an ex-googler got into a dispute with a SJW. He said they were the only ones with balls that would defend women (even though the SJW in question worked with them) and that people like me should do things like go back in time and stop her from doing this. It was also said that they were going to continue to defend her no matter what… which makes me think that I may have to go after the SJW who said it to her. I will link the comment on the sidebar that the mods deleted, but basically saying \"SJWs think they're so special and smart that no one else would dare point out shit like this.\" The comments are pretty much the same and I want to post one of them here… since I was the one to notice that this is a recurring pattern: [–]from FempireDude sent 2 days ago You should be banned from KotakuInAction. She made a big mistake. I can't imagine what else you can say, as you are a pretty unprofessional SJW trying to get everyone fired and not only defend this girl, but actively work against anything that would happen to her/her family. It's so bad that you are literally saying that",
    "I've received a lot of feedback about a previous post I wrote awhile back, called \"Does getting carried help you get better?\". I just wanted to say something to clarify that, and I don't want to derail the discussion from the \"do you think getting carried can help you get better\" post. First off, I'm writing for fitness/training/bodybuilding websites. There, I can do my thing knowing that I'll get paid handsomely and be taken seriously. On more serious topics, I can get very little published, so it seems like the perfect place to get more constructive feedback. I'm also talking for myself, so I'm trying to put aside my ego, which has caused me to write a lot of stupid shit I'd regret much sooner than a post like this gets published.\n\nHere's my story, which is in no way a complete breakdown of your typical lifting routine. I'll explain a little more about the specific goals I'm trying to shoot for, and then let my experience lay these out for you in a general sense.\n\nIn college, I used to have a very difficult time learning to lift weights. First off, my upper back always hurt. Second, this was going on during freshman year of college, which was one of the worst times of my life. Third, after spending a year in a Crossfit gym and a ton of personal training, I came back completely unable to get a decent deadlift. I had been \"failing\" at deadlifts for awhile, since I hadn't properly implemented any sort of training at all for the lift, but I wasn't sure what was wrong with my lower back (a.k.a. my trap): it was my idea of a normal-guy problem- at least, that's what the Crossfit guys were telling me.\n\nSo, I figured let's see what you gotta do to get better at deadlifts. I'll show you two different ways of learning to deadlift, and then you try both of them. I will explain how many reps I'm shooting for (i.e. how many sets of three to six reps at 90% of 1RM). And I will explain the reasons why I think these are a bad idea. I also won't really show you how to do a typical heavy deadlift, since that's really boring, but hopefully with the experience",
    "I made a story. It's not really a short story, even. It's more of a story, a real experience, an anecdote that happened to me, because in my head the first thing that came to mind in the middle of writing the story was the story of a little girl whose mother decided that she needed to go out and buy some fresh clothes to be better able to survive the war. One of those dresses is a little black dress… and they are so light that one must wear an oversized jacket and a tights. This little girl is a girl who needs to learn how to be brave… and she does. One day, a little girl is walking through town. She is going to be very poor once their money runs out. As she is on her way, she meets a girl. And she takes pity on the girl. And the next day, a couple of days have passed… and in the middle of the war, an opportunity presents itself. The war is still happening inside many families that fled back to the South. And the people living in the South would pay a lot of money to send a child, the smallest child, to the school. It would cost around 10 million reais. 10 million reais. 10 million reais is a lot of money. But a lot of people were going there to escape the war. A lot of people were afraid that the war would come back, that many would lose something so important. And the school was the only hope.\n\nAnd they chose that little girl. And the next day, that girl was gone. She was gone. And the next day, she died too. A girl who had no friends, no acquaintances. She didn't even know anything about the world outside of her little box. The school is called Técnico dos Anjos, and its main building is a kind of fortress. It's surrounded by a fence which is about seven meters high and two meters thick. The school was about four kilometers away, and the school had about 100 students. At the school entrance, one can never see the inside of the fortress. The entrance is just a plain wall covered with a big green sign which reads: \"Técnico dos Anjos.\" (This is the only part which is visible to the outside.)\n\nIn the school, all you can see of",

Since I am in a couple vehicles that get lots of damage and are always garaged most of the year (since they are not registered vehicles). I am getting the monthly premiums I was going to pay on the car insurance at $135. My wife gets no insurance (full coverage), and can only insure her personal car, which is a 2008 Saturn. For the first time this year, however, she has to pay for the deductible when she starts driving. I understand that I will have to pay $140 every time I pick her up in our vehicle and drop her off at her house. I have the same premiums as her, but I am wondering if this is a problem. Our insurance is a full-COBRA policy, we are also signing up for the State Farm Insurance Plus. What are the advantages of my auto insurance? If it's only to collect on a policy if I do not have coverage for any reason, I will be getting into trouble without insurance.

    "I'm afraid of a concussion I can't seem to get my head around. I've had three, at least, all in my neck. One my son's. My son suffers from the \"mad cow disease\" and a few months ago I noticed he was getting a little strange looking and then went to the doctor. He noticed this about my son too after seeing the MRI. They said he didn't have the disease so they gave them both to their vet to help test/prescribe any medication. My son had to be put on a respirator and have a tube tied to his nose to help stop the coughing. He ended up taking a lot of the medication he'd eaten and had his lungs pumped. They also gave him a shot to stop the brain bleeding after the pump treatment. My son did very poorly, even on the steroids we had him on. They said the symptoms were caused by the Mad Cow Disease and it was an extreme reaction. Luckily that is rare so there weren't that many people in the general population who'd have had those symptoms. My son has recently been to the vet to get his skull corrected and he's been at that place for about 3 and a half weeks now. It seems the vet doesn't want my son seeing a neurosurgeon at this time as it's too scary and he fears any change might make him better again. He's worried that if the skull gets corrected it'll keep him happy and healthy. My husband's also kind of upset about this because he was the one who pointed out it wasn't necessarily a bad idea until we started to see the brain swelling and the signs of an even worse injury. The brain swelling in this case has been as large we know it will grow and become permanently impacted. He wants this corrected right away and has contacted several of the neurologists. He also contacted the media regarding this because the vet has only been in here about three days and already he's been interviewed. This has only happened when he's had his head measured and the vet said his forehead is very similar to that of a boxer (not to say it's a boxing breed). He also believes this will cause more brain damage since the brain is so delicate, it's constantly growing and expanding. He feels the vet and the doctors are taking a leap of faith on this one. We're in a time now where everyone is so quick",
    "This just in! Reddit user TefuSakunetsu is the one who gave us the image(s), which appear to show the new colors and patterns on the top right and bottom left corners of the page. They also include new icons and a \"Cirno\" button, both of which the user says is for customization/tweaking. The user also tells us that this is a \"re-imagined version of [the game's] old top-left circle and top-right square.\"\n\nTefuSakunetsu also claims that the new circle and square icons should go with the new game's new theme.\n\nThere was nothing in the original post to substantiate that the new circle, square, or button were meant to be cosmetic, rather than visual changes made to make the game faster. When reached for comment, Dengeki, the Japanese magazine that first had the image, told us they were trying to confirm that TefuSakunetsu was the source of the image. But the editor, Natsuki Sakuma, was unsure if the image was Photoshopped, and said he couldn't be certain.\n\nThere's no definitive data on when or if or if not the new color scheme and design will appear on the Japanese servers. The original article did not reference any version, except the old one, for the Japanese release, and thus we can't tell if it will be made available outside of Japan.\n\nWe originally wrote that it may be the English version of the game will receive any new color scheme, but given recent news that there are other versions of the game in the works, as well as new screenshots from a potential Korean localization, that seems like a stretch. With that said, it's all but confirmed the game will get new art, but the release window remains up in the air.",
    "I was browsing some porno sites recently, and noticed that the majority of the girls I saw were wearing bikinis. On the other hand, only a few \"kinky\" girls had worn jeans and shirts. I realized that there must be a big difference in what a male viewer considers as cute and desirable and what a female viewer accepts. I thought it would be interesting to test out a bunch of different women with varying body types by varying their choice of clothing and what they were actually into.\n\nI was curious whether men would find a girl's body a turn-off by their attire or that women find their body sexy if the clothing doesn't restrict breasts. This way, I could see what was attracting different types of guys.\n\nI chose a girl in my social circle and asked her what items that she liked and dislikes for clothes. She wasn't too impressed that she had to choose from so many options, but said she likes bikinis; a lot of guys don't. I then asked her what she has for herself that she does have trouble describing (e.g. something that just turned her on, something that she'd feel better naked without). She replied that she feels safer naked, but when she puts on a sweater she enjoys the coldness. I was pleased with this; although a sweater is not really practical, we never go completely naked with the boys we date, and it's usually during a shower or bath, so I would think that it was more about the comfort. I asked why, and she replies that she thinks it's because most guys just want her to go outside without a sweater, so if she does take off one, they have to get their hands in her bra because they can't get at the zipper. This struck me as odd, but I thought maybe she was being shy. I also wondered if maybe she thought that being cold was sexy when people had no need to see her naked. The next moment she got up from her seat and walked to the bathroom.\n\nI asked her why she had changed her garments, because normally men expect their women to take off their clothes when they're naked. She said that it was cold, the water was cold, and she also couldn't hear her phone because it was in her bra. I asked her why she wasn't wearing a sweater, as she obviously didn't feel anything sexy in her",
    "We can see his point, but this is hardly the first time a member of the gaming press has claimed suicide. It is not the first time he has been accused of suicide. Most of the sites' editors and commenters seem to be unaware of any of this. The posts are in the same general time interval as the suicide posts by another user, \"deadalus,\" which was made two days beforehand, on June 30. Again, the posts are in the same general time interval as the suicide posts by another user, \"deadalus.\" Deadalus makes no claim of suicide, making it highly unlikely that the two incidents are coincidental. We can only assume (hoping?) that the two users might have seen one another, since \"deadalus\" is a user who appears to have read and acted on every single post about the game on RPS. This makes one curious: does RPS really publish \"all the most important people who know\" about the game? Is it just in the case of The Last Guardian someone who knows who the game's supposed star is, someone who can confirm or deny all the rumors of suicide?I think that this raises some very interesting questions. The obvious answer is: yes, we do publish that many editors who know who these people are (see: the section above), so that's why we include references to these people. And we do have that many posts about these people, right before these people are publicly named? Are RPS sites the only place who know who these people are? Does it even matter? No one outside of RPS is ever likely to see this information? Is there a way to tell if anyone outside of RPS is a \"source,\" and if so, who that person is?",
    "https://www.reddit.com/r/anxiety/comments/7g5h4u/how_my_anxiety_can_do_all_that_for/\n\nIn my experience the body is able to recover from anxiety symptoms, even if you aren't consciously trying to recover (I think this is largely due to the fact that the body also has learned to recover from physical pain). However that doesn't mean that I'm not able to recover from other things that, for example, make me feel emotional (like the people I love). The problem is when people make assumptions about how often mental health symptoms occur that are not based on scientific evidence. As I've said before, I get the feeling that the majority of people who post on this subreddit (even people who post with serious diagnoses) are not looking for scientific advice: they are looking for validation of how they feel, whether it's due to anxiety or not, and that comes from a place of fear (as evidenced by their posts). A big part of overcoming anxiety is to realize that anxiety is an actual health problem that affects you, not a feeling, and that you can't blame everyone for this, even if it's frustrating at times. It's important to remember that it is possible to experience anxiety without experiencing symptoms, that we can recover from severe anxiety, and that it does not have to be a long and difficult process (although it can be). Anxiety (and depression, for that matter) are not simple things, there is no easy or quick fix, and it's important to not try to be someone who can. Some people do better than others and, to me, that's the most important thing.\n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to ask a question and give feedback!

A lot of people have had trouble finding the \"job\" they are considering, so for me it's important to help people come to a good answer. I did not intend to teach people how to code; though there are certainly a lot of benefits to learning to code, I see it more broadly as more than taking a job that pays about equivalent to what you could get from coding in the first place. I see programming as having the potential to change how you see and manage your time, give you a skill that you can apply in almost every aspect of your life, and that can certainly make you different from every other person you know. I hope learning to code offers you these things, and if it doesn't please don't despair; sometimes the best thing for everyone is to make a different choice.\n\nI started writing this blog post during my junior year of college as a way to keep track of my progress. I wrote it at the peak of my career (when I was almost done with graduation), before I knew what a highschool graduate was, and after I figured out for certain that I wanted to work in computer science. You're welcome to read it later if you want, but it's not really necessary.\n\nI will briefly describe what I used to live, eat, and have for fun; I hope this will provide context for the things I describe below. I hope it gives you some idea of what's involved in the quest for a job, what's involved with the job search process, and what might help you apply.\n\nMy First Job Search\n\nWhen I was in highschool, I spent about an hour or so each day watching a program called TV Guide that listed jobs in the United States. I learned that there were jobs",
    "\"There is so much about the subreddit which I really miss about /r/pics that I am sad that it no longer exists. I was never that involved with /r/pics - just a lurker, but it was always a welcome space. I do sometimes lurk and contribute, and I did so again recently after a friend posted a link. What caught my attention was that at least a dozen of my friends had linked that post and were expressing disappointment that the community has changed so sharply in the four to five years since I first joined. I think most of my peers were there that first day and will be there for a lot longer, and I'm glad at least some are still so active and passionate about that community.

Thanks also to users who responded to the call for help!\n\nFAQ\n\nQ: How many friends do I need for a subreddit to be eligible for flair?\n\nA: To have your name as a default for subreddit flair, you only need three friends. (You can reach those three friends either by posting a comment somewhere or asking others to comment/thread with you). But you can have five friends who also enjoy Reddit: the three default friends/mod mail is enough; and you will need to tell us where those friends already are (in the comments).\n\nQ: Will the default picture post be updated?\n\nA: Yes. We will occasionally use default flair pictures from previous years as inspiration for new images.\n\nQ: Why is my post on default flair taken away and put on a secondary list?\n\nA: For reasons unrelated to this subreddit - you are on default. For example, if your post gets removed from default flair because it was spam, you may be asked to reply in the thread so we can verify whether your message was spam or not.\n\nQ: How can I tell if a post has been used to help r/",
    "Hello,\n\nMy name is JT_J, not to be confused with JT_A, who is the developer of the moonlander-leds/moonlander-s. The purpose of this thread is to share what I have learned about moonlights and how I solved many issues I encountered.\n\nIn the past, I have worked on the firmware of a few moonlighters. All had issues when the lighting was enabled and were difficult to work around. While some were easy to reproduce by me; some, not so much. The problem we had is that the LEDs (for example the red ones) would turn off or turn on in an unpredictable manner, causing crashes to the firmware.\n\nThe first step was to disassemble the LED to figure out why it is reacting in an irregular manner.\n\nIt turned out to be a problem with a pin-1 in one of the LEDs (not in total light output). There appears to be a problem when switching to a higher voltage value. There are two voltage levels (15v DC). The power LED is on at the 15v level and turns off. The red LED's on the other side are on at the 30v level and turn off. They also display a bright white if any power is applied.\n\nI removed the pin-1 and found that the LEDs did indeed turn on when power is applied at the 15v level but would turn off immediately when voltage was increased above 15v. It only took a quick disassembly to figure this out.\n\nIt seemed to me that if we could find a way to use the 15v DC line as an output at the moonlighter it would solve many of our issues.\n\nMy discovery was to hook the 15v line to a variable-voltage regulator, connected to the LED socket. We found that the voltage regulated input was fine for the variable-voltage regulator.\n\nSo, this is how we used to connect the 15v line to the LED socket:\n\nVcc = (2*5V) / 5V = 9.5V\n\nYou can see the pins 2 and 5 in the picture.\n\nThis way, we could have two line-level outputs for the 15v DC line. The one on pin 2 would be connected to the LED socket and the one on the right would be connected to",
    "I dreamed that I was getting out of an elevator back into the living room, and there were candles and music blaring from the speakers. My boyfriend was there, too, though it could have been a combination of our two separate bedrooms. We got out of the elevator, and I noticed the lights were all off in the room. A strange foggy feeling lingered in the room, and I couldn't think straight. As I walked into the room, I was immediately greeted by what looked like a living room from a movie or TV show. I was confused, and started opening doors and cabinets as if they belonged there, but I quickly realized it was just a hallway and that the hallway was in my own bedroom. The curtains were drawn up tight, and I could hear music coming from above the speakers. After a series of closed doors and a few moments where I thought maybe the music was coming from somewhere else, I heard a voice say, \"Hey sweetie, you need to look in your drawer.\" I had no idea what the voice was talking about, but I opened my drawer and started digging around. I found an old photograph, but it was clearly of a man wearing a trench coat and trench boots. \"Hey,\" the voice said again, \"that's not a picture of your grandfather. No, he died in WWII.\" I started to get really scared, and pulled out my iPhone to take a picture for proof. The voice continued to say, \"Don't worry, we can bring him back to life. We can build him a shrine to his wife and children.\" I was shaking and felt my heart pound really fast, and the camera went crazy and started taking pictures randomly. The voice said, \"Wait. Don't take that. That's a photograph of your grandfather. He's very important to us. It would be disrespectful.\"\n\nRedditors have described the scene as surreal, and one redditor even claimed that \"I didn't know what to think, but I couldn't get it out that I just woke up from a nightmare,\" adding, \"And then my dad came home and I told him what happened, and he just said, 'I'm sorry you had a nightmare.' And he went back to sleep.\" Several others have since described their own similar dreams.\n\nA spokesman for the University Health Services tells the Washington Post that it is investigating",

    "I'm not sure if this is exactly what you'd expect out of me, but I was thinking about this a little with regard to what the church has said about women in the church. I've heard some pretty interesting things and have had some serious questions about women's roles in the church over the years. Here is what I've seen.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is Jesus in the Bible. He talks about women praying, as do his disciples. So this is basically exactly what we see in the bible. This is also something that Jesus addresses in the gospels in a lot of ways. There are lots of men who don't understand the significance of women praying with the women during all the messianic era. This is pretty similar with a great many pre-Christian cultures. A woman is not only permitted to pray, but encouraged to pray. She is part of the community. She is the one that is there to listen to God's Word.\n\nAnother thing that comes to my mind is that this is something that goes on a lot around Christmastime. You get that tradition where women would hang garlands of flowers to see if the house had spirit. This is not just a custom with Christians. But this is also something that went on around Jesus at his death. Many people believe that this was also practiced by women. Maybe because it reminded them of their mother, maybe because they saw a good deed being done.\n\nI think there is a lot to be said for women's role in the church and it does not need to be treated as a weakness. We only come to church to learn a new truth. A new truth we share with our neighbors. It's not simply \"I want to join this group and do good!\" To do good in the church you have to have a lot of courage because if it seems awkward or awkward, there is no way you can actually be sure that what you are saying is right. You need to say it because you believe it to be so. You also need to know from your experience whether it is right or not. That is why it's important that we try to get involved and ask questions at whatever church we are being given to.\n\nSo women, how do you feel about this?",
    "Many trans members of our community (especially transgender Black and femme folks) report that they get more negative questions/comments/emails after they find out they are trans. This has happened even in communities with a very high trans population (as seen here, here, here, here and here). Does this result from having a trans (or even bisexual) community? Or a community that (as I have heard) is more accepting? Or is this just an extension of the broader cis/white/male privilege? My feeling is that \"this\" is much more of a cis/white/male issue because those communities are largely cis. I have been on the outside of the cis community for about a year (I only know of a handful of queer trans people, which was completely new for me) before coming up with this post and feel that not all trans people need to be in this cis/white/male (or heterosexual) community. There are trans folks on reddit who are NOT within the cis community (or just outside of it). This means you don't have to be straight, cis, white or male to ask for help and that helps us to move away from the \"why is everything so complicated?\" question. That said, I believe the cis/white/male privilege does carry over to \"this\", and it perpetuates the idea that non-cis-folks know what they're talking about and can give us advice. Even though the person who sent the question might not understand what we're going through.

    "At the last meeting of the Nutrition Society of Australasia we discussed about increasing fibre intake to 10 grams per day, but it is very clear that the evidence so far is that the beneficial effects of fibre are at least in a range from 1-1.5 g of fibre per day.\n\n\nPersonally I believe that we can have our cake and eat it too. Personally I believe that it actually benefits to eat a very high fibre diet. I think that there is more benefit in the low fibre diet, and I think all the studies prove that. To avoid excess fat, we increase the fibre intake and increase the total daily fat intake.\n\n\nI think we can avoid all the problems with low-fat diets like elevated cholesterol and obesity, without raising our carb intake. We can avoid being overweight as well. I think that the optimal amount of carbohydrates is no more than 50 grams to 70 grams, that is probably around 30-60 grams per day. This should contain an equal portion in each serving of bread, cereals or pasta, for a total daily carbohydrate intake of between 125 to 250 grams. If we take a calorie calculator of 1.4 calories per gram of fat that would give you about 1 gram of fat per gram of carbohydrates per serving of meat, fish, eggs, or dairy products.\n\n\nI hope that this is helpful so that our body-builders and fitness enthusiasts know how to achieve their long-term health by getting their high fibre intake. It is not the right idea to be constantly adding more sugar to your diets in spite of the fact that your doctor tells you that it is good for you. And you should be exercising at least 2 hours per day to maintain or increase your muscle mass. I believe that by keeping the carbs the same and increasing the fibre slightly, we will achieve our long-term health.\n\nHere's a summary of the comments made (there were a lot of them).\n\n\"Fibre is necessary.\"\n\nFibre is something else than glucose. Fibre doesn't just help to lubricate food as it passes through. Fibre is a structural component of proteins, like collagen fibres. Fibre helps to prevent breakdown in our tissues. Fibre is very important for good gut health. One of the most important functions of fibre is the regulation of your intestinal flora. Once your microbiota have adapted to a normal fiber intake,",
    "The last time we went to an Indian cemetery, which was the last time I was with friends, we spent the whole time in the shadow of a huge granite monument that commemorates the battle of Little Big Horn. We had a special place there, because the monument has a large image of a great wolf, taken by one of two photographers working for Harper's Weekly in the 1870s. One of those photographers didn't stop taking pictures long enough—but two were able to take enough long exposure pictures to capture the light that falls through the branches of the trees into the cemetary of the tribe. The light from the wolves is so bright you could read by it.\n\nIt was a hot night as we made our way into town in our Volkswagen. Walking along the highway, which is an old dirt road through the forest, I got a great shot of a man in the distance. And then, before I knew it, the sun was going down.\n\nI had to find a place that didn't block the sun and that was completely dark, so I went for a walk back to the van where I had my camera. As I approached the road with my camera in my hands, I saw the big monument to Little Big Horn behind me. It was at this point that I realized how very quiet the village was. I hadn't noticed it because it was such a long walk back to the van, but the light from the stars that I had seen through everything I had taken with me was so bright it was distracting. And the silhouette of the monument against the trees and the moonlight was so perfect. I wanted a close up shot, so I stopped to look at the monument a few times. I was so happy I even started taking pictures on the way back—but I kept coming back to the monument to see if I could see the silhouette against the moonlight. I remember thinking it was an incredible picture.\n\nAnd at some point I realized that I couldn't stay long at the monument. I had seen how calm and peaceful it seemed, and I wanted to go out to the field for some photos. I was so happy to be there at that time of the evening when everyone was coming out for dinner. I took some pictures of the houses where they would put up supper. I loved it.\n\nBut in the end, I found that this was not the kind of photo",

But it has a strange purpose and a very unusual name: KENI HUR IBRAHIMYO.\n\nIf there is some kind of truth to this story, and KENI is indeed their favourite thing to do, what could the name MEAN, HU, LIR, IR, NIR, BER and DIM in the image mean?

    "This is a comment I wrote on reddit.com regarding a comment on my thread here (as well as a comment I received on another reddit.com thread I created addressing the same topics). I don't think I originally planned to write another comment on the thread I'd already made, but then I decided to put out my own thoughts after a bit of reflecting. But before I get into those thoughts, I'd like to say something about the nature of the relationship between a business and its online community.\n\n\nThe nature of the relationship between a business (that's you, of course) and its online community is generally the same as any other business you're associated with (and I speak from experience). You want to advertise, you provide some sort of valuable service, either free-of-charge or through discounts, or you want to help with promoting your product, service, or otherwise assist the online community in your community. Sometimes, those services include free products and/or services. Other times, those free products are actually optional services provided by a company whose sole reason for being connected to your business is for the purpose of helping to promote your product or service (although in this case, with companies that you do business with, the motivation isn't really \"helping to promote your product/service but rather we would like to make a small amount of money in return for promoting your stuff\").\n\n\nBecause of the nature of the relationships between firms and their communities (and between firms and their online communities in general) it is not uncommon for firms to provide their online communities with free, highly-valuable products and services to keep them happy and productive, in exchange for a one-time fee (usually a very small one).\n\n\nWhile it's an established business practice, and can be seen as beneficial for all parties involved, I often find that firms that engage in these kinds of programs are often too conservative with the products and services that they provide (meaning that they limit just how many services they offer, even to their own communities. In fact, while I have never heard of a company that actually refuses to provide a free product or service even to their own online communities (the most reasonable thing to do would be to at least send people a message or acknowledge receipt of an offer from them, even if the offer isn't accepted), I see examples where firms that offer free services have begun to",

My family and friends only have fond memories of the Wii, and my wife has only spent time with PS3 and Xbox (which were her only experiences with consoles). I grew up playing Street Fighter 2 and The Final Destination, but only a few titles came with online components, which is basically all I've played throughout my life.

I had thought the game looked really cool, but my main concern is a) If the game is balanced and b) If the game feels just right to me.\n\nThe game I picked is Ultra Street Fighter 4.\n\nMy wife played Ultra Street Fighter IV and now my focus is on Ultra Street Fighter. I've played a lot of games on the Nintendo 3DS and I've played a lot of games on the Wii U. But, neither of them have given me any problems. I understand the game is getting its third iteration with a brand new cast of characters, and I love how they've added more to the fighting game, but I'd still like to come away really liking the combat, the story, and the visuals.\n\nSo I thought I'd share what I've played so far and whether or not I can help the player with anything. I'm not going to really give too many details as to the specifics of the game, but I think it'll give a good idea of what the player can expect from the game!\n\nThis is an old post from April, but if you are wondering about the story, you can find it here.",
    "\"With my experience with making, there are a few things you need to know. There are some projects that I've seen go through a minimum contract rate of $200k per year, and some go through a minimum rate of $5000 per project. Let's be realistic, this isn't a business, this is a hobby, and there's no point you should be expecting a return on these projects. \"When I make a personal project, I need to make sure I'm in it for 5 years.\" That's the big one, and it's not something that you should expect of yourself. If you make a personal game, you need to play that game for at least 5 YEARS. I know, it sounds crazy. That means that by the time you get that $500k, it would take you almost a decade to get back to your last investment in your project's development. So to get there, you need to either take out an insurance policy against the project not being completed, make an extremely large investment in your time and have a large profit margin, or get another job. \"This also applies to when you make a business out of a personal game project, you also need to make sure it ends up being profitable; if you're an artist, you're making $10,000 a month and you start making other game assets, your income will be cut in half, and no one will want to give you a paycheck for this work, so there are limits to how profitable you can make a personal game.\" So the key takeaway here is that even the least likely thing that you can ever do, which is make a personal game, should ALWAYS be a profitable investment. In particular, making only a single game shouldn't cost you more than $500 a month to make. As a result, I think you end up having a much bigger ROI on any of your personal projects than your commercial products. Now to be fair, while you should always make your personal game profitable BEFORE you start getting paid money from it, you don't normally get paid for that. I will say that in the cases of making a couple smaller games after having spent 3 years making the one major project, it may pay off for you in the long run, depending on how it turns out. So, if your goal is to make personal games, that's where you",

If I have one for a day without being able to feel the deliciousness of it, I feel empty like the other times. I will look at the menu thinking: well how can they make this taste better then before? And at 3 minutes later, the hot drink comes and tastes horrible.\n\nThe following is the text of the original post:\n\nI am in graduate school in psychology and was about to start an online course.

I don't need a cup of coffee in addition to the other things. Some of my friends who are interested in learning about caffeine and the effects on the brain have recommended it to me. The problem is that I feel that when I am not having that caffeinated experience, I lose my creativity and concentration.

    "I'm an old fart (65) in the military, who has been widowed several times, and who has been on disability just recently. I live alone on a small island with my son, who died in 2004. He had only been living on the island for 4.5 years, and had moved back before coming to the Marines. I worked several jobs since we lost him, but it just wasn't enough to support a family on just $4000 a year. Before he took his last breath, he had saved up enough money to pay my mortgage, car and all of our expenses up to that point. Unfortunately, our car broke down, and after that we were evicted. I had a very difficult time getting back on my feet and getting on my feet after losing him, and the medical costs were going to be out of my pocket, not only because of how much they will cost to replace, but also how much they will be for the future. In the middle of all this, we got into a very nasty fight with my neighbor, who was very drunk, and my son was scared for his life, as were the two of us. We moved out, and within a year of starting to do as much as possible to earn money from my house while I worked one or two jobs, one or two weeks a month at most, I had a major stroke. When the stroke struck, my body was paralyzed for about 2 months. I never had to go to the hospital, but when I asked the VA about it, they recommended I get therapy, and in February of this year, the VA approved me for monthly payments until I start paying off my house. I have not been able to find any of the work needed to feed and clothe myself, let alone pay for the therapy and medication that doctors say should be part of my treatment, and most of all, I have never gotten a full time job since. We are now one week from being evicted from this place where we have lived for 18-20 years at least, due to the VA not paying us on time. I have been so very alone here, and have no idea what to do with myself. It is not an easy problem to solve. There are no services available. I have tried so hard to reach out to anybody in the community. I haven't talked to a therapist since my stroke, and I have",

    "\"Hello everyone. I am currently seeing a therapist in one of my towns. His family (parents, brother, aunts, uncles, cousins, and his girlfriend) are not particularly well disposed to us, and are probably more or less the single reason we moved to this particular town to begin with – in addition to the fact that I recently changed schools. However, they were still very nice to me while I was going through the therapy process and are still very supportive. It is great to be working with a therapist who truly listens to me, makes me feel supported, and will go out of their way to ensure I'm able to live a safe and fulfilled life as both a student and a local resident. I am pretty new to my therapy, as I have never done it before, but I can see why it's important. I was hoping to give you a short (to the point) report and possibly add that I need some assistance in completing some forms for various places to sign a contract after I graduate and settle down in a new town.\n\nFor a little background – I was raised in the suburbs of Los Angeles by a fairly middle class family with one father and three mothers. Because of the poverty that my parents endured during their formative years, they did not have much in terms of financial options. The only real way that they could afford to give us a stable and safe environment was to go to school, and to get a good education. With that said, I still have more than enough money saved up to attend an expensive private school and I'm not planning on going back to my home state and joining a bunch of other students. I've gone to my counselor with my financial issues and have a bit of a shortcoming with credit. She's been very understanding and told me that I will likely have a difficult time paying it back if I choose to do that. I have made it very clear that I do not want any sort of financial assistance, but she says that there are a few scholarships that she could possibly consider for me. It's nice, in many ways. I got a part of a scholarship through a high school I was never really fond of that still paid for a ton of my tuition and living expenses to graduate.\n\nAnyway, what are my feelings on seeing such negativity from a family whose main goal is to help their children pursue their greatest aspirations?",
    "The main reason I'm posting this is because I see a lot of comments on various discussion board pages (mostly feminist-related) in which women come in and say, \"I do not appreciate being treated like a second-class citizen as a woman, and I am tired of being treated like a second-class citizen as a woman, and I will never be treated like a second-class citizen as a woman, and what the hell do women have to do with all of this?,\" and I just feel like people are trying to claim credit for the great work that's been done to create a more equal and just society, and I know that's not true. …. but I also feel that not that many people are saying \"let's get rid of all women\", since that doesn't sit well with a lot of people either. I don't think women are a problem. But I feel like if you read a lot about the issues women face in America, sometimes you get a feeling that maybe men like you, and women don't really like you. I think women would rather be treated like real human beings, and I think we are justifiably frustrated when a lot of men don't give us the respect/favor we should. So that's why I'm posting this. I mean, I'm not really in my right mind just now, but I feel a little uneasy. Like I read some comments and I'm like, \"ok, maybe I should give my opinion on this, because not everyone was thinking how this is all going to go down, how all the women might come out to hate all men with a vengeance.\" …. you go, girl! [–]TheManInWhiteHat (TheManInWhiteHat) 4 points 7 months ago I don't really think this is an issue worth discussing because feminists get a ton of crap for \"mansplaining\" and \"stifling men\", but what's interesting about this is that most of the women complaining about this problem aren't actually complaining directly about how men treat women, they're complaining about them treating men badly. Because, really, if you think about it, most people treat women badly: We're judged on our looks and our intelligence and our work and our appearance. But I think most men treat women badly, and maybe it would shock you to know this, because it sounds weirdly contrary",
    "While not a part of the post, this is my take with my \"personal style.\" Some people might see this as self-aggrandizing and pompous, in other cases it will be seen as a self-help. Please take everything with a grain of salt.\n\nMy personal style tends to reflect where I'm at in my life at the moment, a time when I have a bunch of stuff I'm working on that I need to focus on, and I still want to be able to laugh at my own jokes in a sarcastic way.\n\nSo when I post a picture or post something in comment area, it's for me to be a light-hearted, sarcastic adult; a guy I know I wouldn't ever want to offend. My style of humor tends also to be light and sarcastic; not to get too \"out there\" but generally speaking, I'm \"upset\" and angry a lot in my humor. This is my way of handling these times.\n\nWhat I find funny is everything, however, I am open to any type of humor, comedy, horror, comedy, slap fights, etc. Any type of comedy will not be tolerated.\n\nThis means, if I find a photo of me and my girlfriend, a picture of me and my wife, a picture of a picture of me and a bunch of others, I am NOT happy about being posted, I will not respond positively to being posted regardless of the quality of the photo.\n\nAs a redditor, this also extends to my reddit profile: I don't edit pictures at all. I'm totally fine with anyone viewing a photo of me from my phone or anywhere else. I have never paid for an ad for a picture on reddit, I know because I've actually posted a bunch of pictures of others on /r/pics in the past and never paid.\n\nNow, some people might think that this is hypocritical, it's not exactly clear. I also would like to add that I have never been an internet troll. Also, some people might think I'm too passive in these posts. After all, I don't \"repost anything,\" I just have a few funny comments and pictures that people will find amusing. They are not being paid by me and no one can tell me what I can or cannot post under my personal rules. (Although I might suggest you don't",
    "Dear tenants,\n\nI recently moved to a rental house, and I was given a one-month eviction notice. My former landlord left three months pay on the place, he said he would fix my room when I moved out, but he hasn't done anything. He refuses to fix my bed, my kitchen, the bathroom or the stove, and when I asked him if he would do this, he said he was \"trying\". I'm worried that he won't, or that he is still planning to move out. I also moved into this house just yesterday, it has been 2 months. I'm worried that we're going to be broke for sure if I do not do this. He's been calling me nonstop, threatening violence if I'm not paid tomorrow, demanding that I not answer his doorbell, and threatening that he's going to throw gas on me if I just give him another week. He's also kept sending messages on my phone, threatening and telling me to get out of my new house.\n\nHe's threatening to bring me to jail or kill my dog. He's saying that I will never get an apartment in L.A. If you would like to discuss this, please use Private Message on Reddit.\n\nRegards,\n\n[Redacted]\n\nThe Reddit user asked if the landlord could pay in full, or if the owner owed rent.

    "What is the matter with you people? You like to think the NFL is about protecting you. Well, here's some news for you. The NFL did not protect you from these people:\n\nFrom the time of the first game in 2012 through 2014, in which the Jets were allowed three turnovers, that total was 18. Three of those 18 were directly from opposing players while two of the interceptions were directly returned against them, one for a touchdown (against Andrew Luck).\n\nSince 2013 (the last season, obviously, in which we have enough data), opposing pass defenders have registered 25 turnovers against the Jets, tied for most in any season in the NFL since 2013.\n\nOf these 25 turnovers (in addition to the 12 interceptions in 2014), 18 were returned for touchdowns, tied for second in all of NFL history behind only 2005 (21, according to Pro-Football-Reference). Of those 24 interceptions, six resulted in touchdowns returned by opposing receivers, four resulted from passes going out of bounds, and four resulted from passes that were intercepted and returned for touchdowns by opposing teams.\n\nSince 2005, when we first had enough data to do a table, the Jets are tied for 13th all-time (second behind the 2005 Patriots) in interceptions returned for touchdowns (2) and tied for sixth in interception return touchdowns returned by opposing receivers (6).\n\nYou know, a \"little concerning\" how little the NFL will enforce the notion that you cannot wear a helmet during practice.\n\nIn other news, the Steelers (14-3, 4-2 AFC North) clinched the first seed in the playoffs on Sunday with a win over the Browns.",
    "Recently, a fellow Anon in /r/shitredditsays (a subreddit dedicated to exposing and insulting reddit trolls) made it his business to tell a very rude and ignorant lie about me. This is what he wrote:\n\nWhat does /r/EnoughTrumpSpam stand for?\n\nFor now, the following is simply stated as my personal belief and understanding of those values. If someone had actually asked me, I would have said it stands for \"Enough Trumpspam\". This is not meant to be taken literally, but it is an accurate representation of the way I envision reddit's mod team and the moderators treating a new user. Also, the idea that I am being \"hurtful\" by making people aware about the hate that is still spewing forth from Reddit despite all that has been done for our community and the movement of the internet to be a place for free expression and equality is ludicrous.\n\nThe word \"shitpost\" has come to be synonymous with \"something that can be thrown about without proper thinking or respect\", but the real reason it has taken on such an unflattering (and negative) meaning (aside from using it to avoid taking responsibility for anything and everything) is because of how the word is used today on the internet. Since the web has come of age, the way that it handles information and discourse has changed drastically. The people who created reddit, the same people who created The_Donald, are quite aware of the damage it can cause when used in this manner. Thus, they have come up with many rules, guidelines, and policies to keep people onside, and keep them around this \"we the people\" movement. To paraphrase one of their statements:\n\nLet's be clear where shitposts really come from, because they're everywhere. They're on The_Donald, on /r/shitredditsays and /r/drama, and even on reddit by default. When you type \"drama\" into a search engine or type \"drama porn\" on the site, a whole hell of a lot of shitposts pop up.\n\nBut don't worry! We haven't abandoned the community! All the rules and guidelines (and the policies on certain topics) can be found by searching for \"shitposts rules\".\n\nA word of warning, though: Do not come into r/EnoughTrumpSpam looking",

    "\"This is 4/16, which refers to the date most people celebrate Valentine's Day, aka the day you get to be free/have sex, hence our title. For me, the biggest obstacle here is that we see 4/16 and our day is not that, but to our partners, it is that. Because the word 'free' implies that this is the day that you can be free and you won't have to work so hard for it. And that's not what we want. Our partner wants us to be free just as we are when we're together--we just don't want them to feel obligated or controlled or controlled to anything they aren't capable of doing for themselves. It's also important to us to remember that there are some things that are completely optional for us, like, being able to be on birth control (but I'd go back on that one!). We would like that to be an option, but we don't need to use birth control or do the other things everyone else does to prevent pregnancy that we think everyone else has to do for the rest of their lives. So...we want a day where our partner doesn't have to worry about us being out late, doing things they should be doing with us. We want to be able to enjoy things that aren't mandatory for us (like a nice walk or a movie) without being shamed or told that it's against our \"partners\" idea of love to take our \"naturals\" for such pleasure and then watch them go into labor and then go through the same labor pains with us. \"Just saying...I can't think of anything I'd rather take an evening off at work for, but you're welcome to offer some suggestions...\n\n\"tl;dr: We've been together for a year, and we've decided to forgo Valentine's day and instead celebrate 4/16, the day that we decided is when we want to be in the right state of mind for sex.

    "The original post is written in a manner that is quite unapologetic for the hurt feelings that people can have due to certain depictions of people in the media. As such, it is rather amusing to see that, for better or worse, some people did get quite offended.

But every time I would mention this, I'd be slammed by the same group of people who were offended by the video, saying that the theme of the video was actually nothing more than that—it was so \"stupid.\" It didn't say anything about \"the book that I am reading,\" and yet, because I thought it might, I received the backlash I did.

She's also never had proper health insurance, and her benefits only cover about a third of what she needs. I'm worried about her, especially because she's not feeling as well lately. She was never supposed to be sick this long. So I am worried about her, about what she's thinking and how she's feeling. That's one of the reasons I have been staying in my house as much as I can. I just hope she gets better soon. It's not like she has health insurance now. But you know what? I will gladly pay for it. And you know what else? I would even pay for it with the money I make off of here doing freelance work. There are times when I have been sick and then had to work late, and this is the stuff it cost me to get in and out of bed.

    "I got a really odd email just a few days ago asking if I could do a post on my experience with the \"S-curve\" over at the Daily Kos. I thought it was really odd, because I've always had a much more nuanced view of how people's behavior affects others than that. But I've also thought a lot about how the culture of the internet makes it impossible for my opinion about something to be fairly representative of the people who are also talking about it. (Like the way the political and financial world are really different worlds, and are often perceived in very different ways.)\n\nHere's my post:\n\n\"I ’hope this ’might be worth reading on the S-Curve.\"\n\n\nSo, if you're trying to put together a life guide to the \"S-curve,\" here is a good example of how that looks in practice.\n\n\n(Note: I do want to point out that as of today, the \"S-curve\" has only just broken out into the mass consciousness, and has been covered on this blog before. But I was at the height of my ability to make sense of it, and also a couple months ago, the internet took on a whole new meaning that made those things seem less important. So there may still be a tiny bit of a bias when I talk about this.)\n\nThe S-curve has been on this blog since December 2010, when my wife and I decided to try something different with our lives (at least in the US). And during my entire life, I'd always been a pretty happy person. So I got a whole bunch of positive news in those first few weeks.

Here's their own blog post:\n\nIn order to protect the integrity of an ongoing investigation, we will not comment on the reason for a particular question's appearance on /r/news. However, Reddit is not the federal government, and /r/news is a forum for the exchange of news. We will provide the reason(s) for a deletion once it has been provided to us by the person(s) submitting the information.\n\nReddit has, since my post was made, responded to several questions, some of which I have listed in the post below. At least one of these has been deleted, but I will do the same for it because apparently the moderator didn't feel that it was important enough to post. My apologies to anyone who has had to endure the horrors of seeing these questions posted and are now having to answer. But please don't let the post's length stop you from reading the answer. I'm not posting the answer. You just have to scroll down for it. I have archived it under this post for the duration of this particular issue. Again, it is my hope that this will be the last time we need to make this request. Thanks!\n\nNote that, as well, the request has not yet gone beyond \"the moderator\" and it still needs to make that final step before it's posted.

    "If a cooperative succeeds, then its members will be expected to share the proceeds with the cooperative. If one of the cooperative's members is an activist, activist workers may form a collective to try to make a cooperative succeed, and may demand a share of the profits. Even if an alternative is a cooperative in the hands of private owners, if that group can also compete in a free market, then its members would be expected to share that group's profits. Would a collective of activists be capitalistic or socialist? Capitalistic: A competitive market means that everyone can choose among the competitors; a cooperative could not choose among its members. Socialism, however, means that only members of a cooperative can choose among the choices of its members, and that the cooperative collectively owns the whole enterprise — even the profits. This implies that the cooperative will be capitalistic even in its initial phases, when no individual member can directly start an enterprise.\n\nI also read that the \"socialist\" nature of an early cooperative means that when their members are capitalists and the workers are non-capitalists, \"that the cooperative (as they will be in the future) will be socialist.\"\n\nThe issue is this: if a cooperative succeeds, how should you feel about the profits that its members are expected to share with the cooperative? As a non capitalist, I have to acknowledge that their success is a success for the collective. If we, as taxpayers, can get that cooperative to succeed, is it really fair to ask the profit to go to the government? If a cooperative can't survive in a free society without the cooperation of its members, should the cooperative's profits be redistributed to its members?\n\nThe argument against socialists and communists is that socialism can't even be in an initial phase. The workers just form the cooperative if it doesn't survive in a free market (although if it survives the initial phase, they themselves will get a share.)\n\nI am not going to even address the argument for socialism here, as I am far from a socialist, and because the argument for socialism in general is that it is not just communism that makes people free, but all other forms of government. I'm also not going to make an argument for why private sector cooperatives succeed in the economy. In that case, you are talking about people setting a joint venture company, and then you are left",
    "I'm not going to pretend I care about the racism in South Park – they've made it clear that the show isn't really about race. But something I notice every time I re-watch a fresh episode is how the writers make fun of white people and how that's not really very common in television – it seems like they make fun of just about everyone. It goes like this: In the beginning of the episode, the white protagonist tells a black girl that she's funny, good-looking, and she probably won't have to pay anything for it. The girl's like \"WTF? The white man has all the money!!?\" And then later in the scene she says \"If you could afford it, would you buy a bra from someone who looks like you?\" It makes me feel really uncomfortable watching, honestly. It's not something I thought would end up being a problem. It's not something I thought would be normalized. So I came across this episode because I remembered laughing at it a few years ago, and was like \"Hmmm, that's definitely something I've experienced, so yeah…\" And then I remembered that this is a show that is about South Park – and now I realized they literally said this to me earlier this week. As a Black woman, this is something I will have to constantly remember. As someone who's lived my life in a country where this kind of prejudice, this disrespect towards our \"otherness\", has been normalized in the media, in the public. As someone who's dealt with the racial divide and the social divide as someone who's very outspoken on social issues in the media. And as someone who's really seen some of the differences in how \"ethnic \"people are treated by those of us who've grown up as an entirely different race. I'm not going to claim to have the solution, but I feel there's something I would like to write about. And here goes.\n\nThere's a huge difference between a white person making a racist joke in a comedy. There is no humor in that. And while I can't claim to know where or why these jokes originate, I do know I'm not the only one who has felt the weight of this in my skin while watching South Park. I remember hearing a joke that started with \"I never met a black guy that could pull that off.\" As a person",

The Hunger Games follows a very, very small group of people living in an alternate world in which teenagers can be anything but teenagers and there are only a handful of people left alive who remember the terrible rebellion. This is, of course, nothing like, well, reality. It is also not a new story. There have been movies and books before and there will be more because I read this one and it really didn't do it any justice because it was so focused on these kids who are going to be very, very different.\n\nWhen I first heard Jennifer Lawrence was in it, I thought, \"Okay, I guess, I'll see what it's like.\" But then I realized we'll probably never know because she will be trapped in that world forever and will never be able to get away. And even when she finally does get away, it doesn't end well for her.\n\nIn fact I don't remember when, I probably will never forget the moment that she starts reading the books. I was walking home and I turned to look back, there was Jennifer Lawrence holding the book close to her face, which is probably really important when she's reading because it's like a veil from which I cannot escape. It will be a while before this movie is released, but it's worth knowing this woman was in it because I absolutely love that book and the movies will never make it any less fantastic than it already is. If you like it, you will like the movie because it will be about different circumstances. It will be a very different story.\n\nI cannot wait to see the movie because the writing is so perfect and every line is perfect.\n\nJennifer Lawrence is not even the only actor in this movie, the character played by Josh Hutcherson is perfect. He's not a movie star, he's just an average kid with no special talents but great luck and great luck is what these kids need. So yeah, Jennifer Lawrence is not there, because she wouldn't let him in but for another actor who will be playing a character not like him, a character who is really good-looking and funny and he is completely in love with Jennifer Lawrence as an actress. You see something wrong when you see this story come together because she is a completely different person than your ordinary little kid, and the difference",

    "\"Dreamgirls\" is a film that explores not only gender issues but the struggles of being an adolescent. It is a very sensitive film that shows girls having different relationships. It is about being vulnerable and also about being brave and accepting one's own body. It is about sexuality and pleasure. It touches all of the questions that adolescent girls go through, such as sex, body image, fear of rejection, and a woman's responsibilities – such as marriage and motherhood. This is an important film for those of you concerned about the status of women in our society or those who may be questioning the meaning of life as a young woman. It is not a feminist movie. It has a deep and profound message about sexual identity, what love means, and is a film that encourages girls to be kinder and more compassionate. While the movie is very personal and is based in reality, it also is very beautiful and inspiring. There are some really moving moments from the movie that may disturb some viewers. The movie portrays two young adults having problems. The movie begins with one of them saying to the other \"that's where we are\", and the woman replies \"how about we begin at the beginning?\". The other girl asks the young woman if she is not scared, and the woman replies yes. We feel with the young woman that she may be brave to be her own woman. However, the woman doesn't want to be defined by the way she feels. She's very young and does not yet understand the differences between what men and women feel. The way she looks and the way she acts are somewhat unimportant – they both become apparent very soon. We see that there is a lot of loneliness going on in this relationship. Some of the things the woman is doing in the movie are very brave. She chooses to give the man who she is in love with a piece of her heart, an object of affection, and she accepts the possibility that she may want to get a tattoo. She is brave to be herself and have her own feelings. There are other things done in this movie that we can criticize and dislike. As a former lesbian, I believe that being brave and having your own feelings doesn't make you a lesbian or an easy straight woman. However, I believe a lot of the time we are seen as a lesbian because we speak openly about lesbian issues. If people are surprised that more lesbians are taking part in the film,",

    "'\"Perks of Being a Wallflower\" - one of the most beautifully crafted young adult novels ever to hit the screen - opens in the autumn of 1991. Set in a small Midwestern town, the movie follows high school senior Ann on a high-strung high school run which is quickly disrupted by one unexpected student. 'The Perk of Being a Wallflower' is actually a film that is about many things and all is not what it seems to be.\n\nThe movie tells the story of high-school student Lydia (Olivia Williams), who finds herself in the midst of a scandal that nearly destroys her life. She also finds herself on the receiving end of verbal abuse, bullying and threats from bullies who feel Lydia has no place in a school community.\n\nThere is a big difference between a bully, who doesn't like kids and who is not welcome on campus, and a person who is afraid they will be punished for what they are doing, because that person may have made a mistake somewhere or perhaps they are simply a little too \"faggy\".\n\nI've read hundreds of books. They tell you what people will do and think. Books are never perfect and they can never tell you all the things that happen in people's lives.

    "\"The Legend of Bagger Vance\" is an Australian film about a boyhood friend that helps solve a murder on a remote island. The movie is set in the early 1900's and is really well rounded for a feature length story. The lead, Jason (Brett Anderson) is a boyhood friendship with Bagger (Ewan McGregor) that grows into something more as the story progresses. It's an intense film filled with action, comedy, and emotion. The story is really well told from start to finish, with some really great performances by the main actors as well as Ewan McGregor and Brett Anderson. Despite the length of the film, the pacing is just right and you'll be laughing from start to finish. We'll also note that the film is well worth the purchase of a VHS. The audio is clear enough for an all around great movie and the opening shot of Bagger's house really sets the tone for what is to come. With this, \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\" starts as a great movie, but it definitely has the potential to grow much much richer, and become even better upon it's DVD release.\n\nReview by: Jeff Reneau\n\nIf you want to view more movie reviews, be sure to subscribe to the site by using the link below.

    "\"Bastards!\" the sound of the gun fired, as the black, tattooed bodyguard's gun goes off and the two young men, both in the middle of their sex, jump out of the way. Before they realize what is happening, they will be cut down by the black-clad man with two guns. \"I killed them,\" shouts the blond, hissing man, who's pointing the guns at the black body. He is the villainous, bald, hulking man with the guns. But there can be only one Darkness. I am not a hero. I just love the dark, I love the feeling of being alive, of doing something about it, of being able to make some change.\"\n\nThe most amazing thing about \"Cross of Iron\" is the incredible, emotional performance from the lead actor, Jason Momoa. You want to run up to him and hug him just to see his smile. You are hooked from his character and everything is captured on screen. The other cast members are outstanding as well. And, it doesn't hurt that director Jason Fuchs wrote the script after his wife and production manager were killed in a motorcycle accident. So, the impact of the personal tragedy and the loss of his business partner is also included.\n\nThere's a big reason why \"Cross of Iron\" is a must-see, \"Black Mass\"-type movie. It's based on the classic novel by James White and it's directed by a movie lover herself. The director's daughter, Emily Fuchs is in the movie as well. So, it's going to be a movie that you want to watch if you love a good \"Black Mass.\"\n\nI think there is something in this movie that will give you goosebumps. The movie is filled with such great acting and acting that just captures you. We have this dark, heavy and evil villain (who is played by Darren McGavin, the most underrated and underrated actor of 2016) and we have a small story that is full of twists and turns. So, it's a movie that will entertain as well as frighten the person who is watching it. The screenplay is an underrated gem but, for my money, the main reason of why I'm calling it \"Black Mass\" is because of the ending of the movie. It's really something.\n\nI've read this book before and it",
    "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214400/page/tt0084241/ref_=fn_al_tt_1 The film opened on November 28th, 2007, in 2,800 theaters. It earned a dismal $9.65 million and earned just 19 reviews. The film cost $65 million and grossed just over $110 million worldwide. And it wasn't a flop either. As of January 30th, 2008, the film earned an average of $13 million a week and in just under 2 years, it grossed over $220 million worldwide, or 1/5 of the gross of the original \"Ghostbusters\" and just a bit more than the original \"Terminator.\" At the beginning of the film, after we see a giant ghost walking across New York, there is a shot that gives us a glimpse into an alternate reality where all of the original stars of the \"Ghostbusters\" franchise still exist and are still alive. When we see these stars in their everyday life scenes they live in, we can see they are no longer playing the same characters they played 10 or 20 years ago in the original film. While this was not my first introduction to the \"Ghostbusters\" franchise, I had never seen these characters play anything similar to the way I've grown up and loved them. I had never felt the connection with each and every character, but we get to see this in \"The Last Legion.\" These characters have been through many changes in their lives and while we see scenes where they did not look any different than they had in previous versions, it was obvious they had aged. The two main characters play different roles, but not in the way fans might expect. The Ghost of the original film, Bill Murray, has become not the wise old professor who speaks with wisdom, but a new character. He has become a sort of spiritual adviser. This, for me, is the best change in the film. Bill Murray has become something more, something more poignant and real. He is present and in our lives from the beginning of the movie forward, but in a different way to how we have known him in the past. The ghost that runs through the film and the whole movie is none other than \"Mabel\". This is the spirit of the original \"Ghostbusters\" that has lived inside of me this entire time watching the original \"Ghostbusters\". This",
    "\"This is an interesting one. It's an action movie that's all about driving, because it's got all the same elements. Well, actually more interesting elements. But the driving doesn't happen when you're actually watching movies as a character, and so the way it feels to do this is as a spectator. You know there's a real danger of ending up in a coma, of dying when driving your car as a way of life seems to be the only way to go. So this is really about trying to learn to drive so you can get away from all this.\"\n\nTo review, some plot points in \"Drive\" are as follows:\n\nA man dies during a road rally. We then follow the new owner who is a professional driver of a sports car so skilled, in fact, he drives through the rain. We watch him test his skill, and eventually prove himself a worthy owner and driver of the world's fastest (and biggest) car. We meet the other drivers and we learn about their lives and what motivates them.\n\nThis movie wasn't an action film at all, but a movie that shows the true meaning of the term, \"movies.\" We see how a movie can be a vehicle of art, of history or of pleasure.\n\nThe movie has elements of the classic thriller movie with the same old things that keep us hooked, like the mysterious characters, the thrill of being the center of attention and the suspense of knowing who the villain is.\n\nBut one part of \"Drive\" that may have the biggest impact for you is the opening scene. The scene is filled with sound, and the dialogue is crisp and detailed. In fact, the whole movie is filled with a strong presence of realism and the feel of a realistic world.\n\nWe all know that when something is realistic, the world around the story comes to life—sometimes a little too real. When you have a movie that can help us imagine the way the world would be and how our lives would play out—it's all a story. This movie does this brilliantly right up through the end.\n\nIn the movie's closing scene, a character named Nick (Michael Shannon, who is one of the three directors and also won an Oscar for making the movie) is being interviewed over his role in the movie, which was the car crash that actually ended his life.

    "While you were watching \"Juno\" there must have been a lot of feelings running though your body. There were people who were sad, people who wanted to cry. People who were happy, people who wanted to laugh. It was a very strange experience to have a movie make you feel things like this. That feeling of being \"stuck in\" a frame of your mind and of a movie making you think about the characters inside it.\n\nHowever, this movie may not be what you actually think it is, but since we are discussing how it shows a person's own mind as if it's living in a movie, it was very interesting. When you think about how you feel about certain aspects of people or movies it's very difficult to find a consensus. In any case, I feel that \"Juno\" would be better if we are discussing those feelings of people's lives and emotions rather than what the movie has to do with \"Juno\".\n\nOf course, there were a few things that were not necessarily wrong. There were times when we laughed and felt happy. There were times when we felt a certain emotional pain. However, the movie was also very clever at times. On the other hand, there were some things that made the movie feel empty. You get so caught up in wanting to get out, in trying new things and in not really knowing what's going to happen next, that you forget to consider where the story is going.\n\nUltimately, \"Juno\" is a very difficult movie to review. On one hand, it tries to be an honest depiction of a person's mental state. On the other hand, it also wants to be an honest depiction of a movie, so it does some things that are very artistic. When viewed from this perspective it is very, very different. For example, in the scene outside the car where we find out all about how they got to Australia, there have many different angles of the frame. At one point they are sitting right there, but then the camera pans to a slightly different angle. It is as if you are sitting in the right place on the right view of the world.\n\nThis movie has many moments like this. It has all those moments where you are caught up in wanting to explore your inner world. At the same time, it also wants to show us that the outer world is interesting too. A few more",

Using a super computer, Blutrich takes over the computer of George Stark, a German businessman living in Vienna, who is responsible for ensuring that the government archives of the world's nations are accessible to US intelligence operatives. Blutrich is a perfect target because he has just been promoted to Colonel due to his experience from the Vietnam War, and has now moved to Stuttgart.\n\n\nAfter taking over Stark's bank accounts, Blutrich discovers that his bank is used to fund a CIA operation to steal global documents.

    "\"One of the most stunning works of cinema ever is Steven Spielberg's \"Eyes Wide Shut,\" released on Christmas Day, 1999. The film is a visual tour de force, a film of beauty and grace. It's also, of course, the story of a sexual relationship between two lovers. Spielberg directs \"Eyes Wide Shut\" like a virtuoso violinist: with an ease and confidence that belies the material. He also plays with the conventions of the relationship movie: there's the typical sex scene (on screen and off); then comes the awkward one-on-one scene; then one has dinner together. (It's so romantic!) The movie is all about power, the use of it, the fear of it and its limits. The characters don't want to do what it demands, which ultimately drives us toward understanding, a humanist resolution. There are other movies about love that are more interesting, but \"Eyes Wide Shut\" is also about lust, and \"lust,\" a subject that is fraught with responsibility.\n\nFor this reviewer, the most powerful component is that the characters are women without the sexual innocence of the man that they share their most intimate moments with – and when not in an erotic relationship, this is about who they are at their most tender: mothers, sisters, daughters. All of them have to find a way to move on from their past experiences, with some success: the mother with her daughter, the sister and sister-in-law and the mother-in-law's daughter, and the sister with her husband. But the mother is an example of how not to handle this subject, since we see the mother try to talk some sense into her granddaughter:\n\nShe didn't really know that her granddaughter was growing into a woman: she'd never been able to understand all of the conflicting feelings inside her. That was what she did know. The girl was the girl, and it was only human, she figured, that she should be loved.\n\nIf she could have, the mother would have. She would have loved her daughter's lover; she would have accepted him as her companion (and her sister and brother; their bodies should be inseparable). But the mother was born with a need and a demand: she wanted to be loved. Thus, the moment her daughter realizes her love for her son-in-law, that mother",
    "Snowden. Snowden. Snowden. I'm trying to figure out why I don't care about the movie so much as I do. I've read about it enough to judge what it's like. You should do the same. (We're sitting in his flat in Berlin in a hot summer night, where we once discussed the future of technology.) There are scenes in the movie that get people all hot and bothered and interested, or at least get us wondering, and they're not the scenes I saw in the press. The movie follows two friends who work for the NSA, and one of them, a computer specialist named Kristinn Hrafnsson, is being interviewed in his apartment. The other guy is called \"Trent,\" and he's a young guy named Booz Allen employee whose mother lives in New York. Tarnavin is an excellent actor and he's great here. As far as the movie is concerned, it's not his most substantial role ever. You get something of a sense of his life and what he cares about, but it's not quite the book (I'm thinking both about your question and about our exchange at the bar). He's not that important a character. That doesn't justify me not care about it. At the same time, it also doesn't answer the question that you're asking: Why am I not even vaguely interested in seeing this movie? As I saw it, the movie didn't really address Snowden's situation. All you are shown is a pretty guy saying \"Booz doesn't understand how bad the problem is\". And the big problem he points to is that the phone-record programme is so secret that even the people who work on it often don't know the details of what they are doing. Booz Allen can't even tell them precisely why they can't give out the numbers they record under warrant. It's not the big thing that people on the phone-records problem would be like – they're not actually spying on you or doing anything like that. So it's sort of like an anecdote in a novel, or on CNN and the like, but we're not really going to spend much time on it.\n\n\"The one question I'm sure you'll ask is about whether I agree with Edward Snowden or not. It's a good question. What I'd say is that it is a very interesting event that has made people aware of",
    "While I loved \"Shrek Forever After\" there are a number of minor problems with the film that detract from its overall quality of storytelling and acting. The movie's story is not only disjointed, but is also lacking in any kind of focus. It's clear the writers and director were more concerned about making an entertaining and funny movie and not trying to fully tell a story in the form of a traditional story arc. You see, we are told almost nothing about the background of our main character: The Duke of Deception. That's because he was born and raised in his family's magical forest known as The Evergreen Forest. Our hero comes to Decepticon HQ only by chance; he has been lured away by the princess of these woods, Princess Fiona. The only problem is that he doesn't know what he's doing and, as a result, he ends up doing more harm than good to Fiona and her kingdom.\n\nWe also never get any depth, development, or understanding into The Duke himself and why he does what he does. The only thing we really learn is that his father, who is a terrible man who doesn't want the Duke anywhere near his family, raised him to always follow the rules. It's made pretty obvious from the beginning that The Duke is not an intelligent man and we rarely do get the sense he makes good decisions with regards to what he does. On top of that, we never really get to know The Duke (with the exception of his brother Decepticon Lord, a far better character) like we would in a movie with some development for each character in the narrative. It's as if these two characters were only there to serve as story props to the overall plot, as if the film was afraid to actually tell a complete story and instead was instead trying to fill it with one giant joke!\n\nDespite those problems, the movie is still entertaining to see with excellent performances on the part of the cast and it's easily entertaining to watch. Those who may have had a hard time with the film in the previous reviews will find no problems with this one, however. I'll admit that the movie is flawed and the plot is a mess with numerous plot holes and subplot points that could've been made clearer and some dialogue that could've been better. However, I do enjoy this movie and will find lots of amusement in seeing The Duke do his things.",
    "Directed by James Gunn\n\nWritten by Nicole Perlman, Nicole Perlman, James Gunn\n\nStarring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel\n\nReleased May 5, 2017\n\nThere are few things Marvel fans can look forward to in life more than the release of another Captain America film, or, indeed, a third Captain America film. So we've not been too disappointed with the Marvel films from so far. Most of our time spent in the real world watching them has been on the small screen, usually on BBC. The latest Captain America movie (the third iteration) was actually better than the first two. Still, even for the great Iron Man, it is a bit of a letdown to have to wait another year for another solo caped crusader epic, which at times it feels like we've been waiting for. For a while it seemed as if Marvel was going to take a break and start looking at other films like DC's universe. Then, they put it back on the table, as if it had never been in the first place! Finally we get a Captain America movie with a great cast, and it is even better than any of the previous ones in my opinion. I'm really excited to see what they come up with next, and I'm hoping for the best. The previous Cap films had the right balance between action and comedy, and this movie has the perfect balance between both. From our MCU review:\n\n\"With a strong solo outing in \"Guardians 3\" and a solid and entertaining ensemble follow-up \"Guardians of the Galaxy (2017)\", Marvel Studios has demonstrated it can find a satisfying balance between their big-screen Avengers universe and the shared universe of DC's super heroes. At the same time, however, director James Gunn has shown he can craft a film that has comic book charm but just as much heart, with no obvious Marvel weaknesses (outside of some characters becoming the focus of a third film series). \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" is a return to form for the MCU. It's no Wonder Woman, but Gunn has added a lot, making the film more cohesive than the first and more like the previous two installments. This movie is filled with humor and action and an intriguing villain. The film is definitely worth checking out, even though the plot doesn",
    "\"A film that takes the genre of the original sequel and completely twists it. But what is the first thing we get to see. Is it still one of the best movies ever. Well in this case it isn't. In fact the first half is a film of no consequence, if any at all, it is just filler for a sequel that is going to be far worse and more boring. I can already feel a few film makers in Hollywood thinking about a sequel in this direction. As well as another film made in the 'Taken' universe where the plot is very similar to this, probably the same director because the first film was based on the books, 'Memento', for many people have seen it and it was good. \"Not much more to say. \"I don't want to discuss more about this movie. I don't want to spend time and energy that the movie isn't worth and that it really can just as easily have been made by anyone else.\"\n\nA few days after this, I went to see the movie itself. You can see the review on this site. I have to say, it wasn't as bad if not worse in my opinion. For one everything was very similar for the first half of the movie, except you didn't see the same bad actors. Plus the camera work was good. Like so good that I could see the movie in my head through the screen. I could also hear my thoughts echoing back. I have also to admit that some people hated this new take on the \"Taken\" franchise, when they aren't being paid. After the first \"Taken\" movie, this one was one of the few that I liked. But this time it was bad.\n\nSo, the question is - Does anyone else think \"Taken 2\" is a little to close to the same as \"Saw\" while remaining one of the best movies ever made? If you don't like this movie, it probably isn't for you.\n\n\"Taken 2 Review:\n\n1. It's been ten years. The events of the original \"Taken\" happened.

    "\"13 hours\" (2004) will be the first film made by former members of the US Navy SEALs to be released in a major motion picture as part of the CIA's \"Black Budget.\"\n\nThe $200,000 to $500,000 budget of \"13 Hours\" appears to have been used to produce the movie's top-secret script. Some of the Hollywood executive's suggestions in the movie are listed in the document.\n\nAccording to the review, \"In the document, the producer gives some guidelines regarding sound design, with specific details about the 'tactical effects' (explosions, etc.) during the movie, and the \"overall sound\" that will be used. The producer also mentions that the \"noise is to be quiet but can't be too loud.\" He offers the following as examples of \"overall sound\" in the movie:\n\n1. A helicopter in the movie \"will have 'a lot of power in the cockpit.'\n\n2. 'Our team in the room will have the distinct sound of yelling.'\n\n3. A fire truck sound will be that of being pulled and the tires squealing.\n\n4. 'We will have the sound of the police department being shot at.'\n\n5. 'The door to the room will have a 'pop of air' as it opens and closing.'\n\nThis is a complete copy of the document.\n\nIn addition to using government-funded weapons and training for the movie, many of the movie's characters take part in training programs, which run the gamut from special operations to special education students and are conducted by civilian law enforcement agencies outside of the military itself.\n\nThe Hollywood executive describes a scenario he had to implement at the movie's location and even details a \"counter-coup\" that was necessary if some of the team was to make it through the movie. The film even has scenes shot by the real Navy SEAL team, known as Naval Special Warfare, Inc.\n\nYou can download the document at the bottom of this article.\n\nWhat you might want to do is print out this article before watching the movie.",
    "A classic case is being made in Hollywood against the film, especially after the backlash against the movie \"Zero Dark Thirty\". After months of rumors and innuendo and public outrage, the film has been officially cancelled. When I heard about the cancellation, I knew that this was one of the worst movie I would find in my life, due to the sensationalized nature of the story and the fact the movie was going to be shown by several well-known Hollywood studios. But how and why did the movie finally be cancelled? I am sure that one of the reasons was due to the fact the film was \"too controversial\" in a few viewers's eyes, but the fact was the same one that made the movie so unpopular on IMDb, too. If you are unfamiliar with this site, then you may want to take one look at the reviews of the movie. You can find reviews for several other movies in the \"others\" section, but this movie was one of the hardest to figure out, as it would really require you to have an opinion about the story and plot of the film, which seems very hard to pull off. That being said, here is the truth about the movie. It is just not that good and you should not watch it. I cannot tell you if the movie is good. But it's not that great either. And, in case you haven't heard or seen all of the rumors about how terrible the movie was, I strongly advise you to stop reading now.\n\nThe movie will be shown on December 17, and is currently available for purchase on iTunes (affiliate link).\n\nRelated\n\nAds (learn more about our advertising policies here)",
    "The Fountain follows the journey of a woman, played by Natalie Portman, who discovers she has an unusual power. However, unlike most other \"fountain\" type powers, she has to kill people to use it.\n\nThe movie is about the relationship between a young woman, played by Jessica Chastain, and the fountain-like plant that she has discovered called \"St. Anthony's Stone\". Through this stone she can channel power. However, she then has no control of the ability and is drawn to kill.\n\nIn this part of the story we also learn more about a powerful enemy that is fighting against all of humankind.\n\nThe movie does very well at showing the power of the stone through the story. There are even some interesting special effects. But this is not a movie from the 90's and therefore cannot be dismissed.\n\nThe movie is very well made and has good effects. The characters are well designed and move realistically. The movie is not overly scary or action-packed.\n\nWhile all the characters are well rounded and there is enough time for some development, the movie does have its moments of angst. The whole time there is also a sense of wanting to leave and get back to our everyday lives, but by the end of the film there is still one more big picture which is all that's needed.\n\nOn a side note, the best part of this movie is Natalie Portman. Her performance is outstanding, but the movie would have been great, without her.\n\n7.5/10\n\nThe movie \"The Fountain\" has been rated 7.5/10 by IMDb.com users.

    "\"The movie \"The Cannonball Run\" was a popular movie because the characters acted like they didn't know each other's names; they just went to the same place and acted the same in certain places, where the dialogue and scenes fit the story, but they made it seem like they weren't working together at all. The movie \"Cannonball Run\" also did a good job of creating multiple timelines, each of them connected by the same action, with certain events occurring in several time periods. Many people liked this because it was like having multiple alternate Universes in one movie. In both versions of the movie we had to make up our minds whether the movie characters actually knew each other, or if the movie was a complete fraud based on \"alternate Universes\". For me, the movie \"Cannonball Run\" was just a bunch of people that happened to be in the same place running across the same obstacles. Also, the actors did their best to appear like they didn't know each other, and it worked well – for the most part. I don't believe the movie to be a \"classic\", I don't think it's even a good movie. If you happen to like this movie, then you aren't paying attention. If you do like this movie, please don't feel obligated to like it even if you don't like it. If it doesn't make you want to watch other movies, or you really like this character, I would guess that you will enjoy it. The characters are decent, the action is a little boring, but when the movie was over I felt satisfied. This movie's \"R-rating\" in particular didn't bother me, so I don't know how anyone could get upset when they see the movie. It really didn't try to shock me in the least, and I think it had the right amount of violence. Just like \"Spice World\", I was able to ignore the movie's graphic violence because I was watching an action movie. The movie \"The Cannonball Run\" is not worth a full star.\n\nHere is the full text excerpt from that book review by Steve Johnson that was included in the review we posted on July 9th:\n\n\"Cannonball Run\" was an enjoyable movie to watch, even if I don't think it was quite as good as many people expected it to be. Most people like to see",
    "This film is all about what's in between the lines; the mundane and the impossible and about how our fears, the questions, and the uncertainties surround us from all directions in time and space. It deals with what it means to be in the middle of a war and what it means to do, with the uncertainty of all those things that come into our lives. I've always felt the question of how a man does his job will always be a part of this film. A lot of times directors can handle the subject matter of war in a realistic way where the movie is focused on what actually happens, but \"Unknown\" explores and explores and explores again and again. It gives a lot of insight and I think also adds another dimension to the movie, one that I found more real than what I would have thought before watching.\n\nA big question for me about this movie being made was how did those guys get so far in the project, much less the actual execution of it. After seeing the film the answer was not too difficult to reach.\n\nA group of six teenagers, all under the age of 17, got together and decided to collaborate on a project, a comedy screenplay that they drafted. The script was written by an unknown author, which the boys put together the day they were offered this script by the director, who was going to direct it himself.\n\nAfter filming a few scenes, a young person, a boy and a girl got arrested for being part of this gang that was stealing money and guns. A few months ago while the boys were filming the final scene of the film I was shown some of the raw footage on the film while the other boy was talking about his life before making \"Unknown\". He said a lot of the people in that group lived below the poverty level and didn't have very much, but that they always had someone in their lives they loved, and had enough to go and stay when someone in the neighborhood came down with a gunshot wound or some kind of accident.\n\nThe film isn't about what happens when someone is killed, or how the people of this world react when people die, but it's about how a family reacts to the loss of one of their members. There were a lot of difficult, uncomfortable shots that were very important to the character development of the film, including the most painful scene of the film.

    "\"In this world of spooky stories, paranormal investigations, unexplained disappearances and even government conspiracies, nothing is quite as scary as a real-life haunted house, and none has captured the public imagination quite like ParaNorman. Based loosely on the story of a wealthy New Orleans family whose home is infested with zombies, the film takes a very creepy, gory, and somewhat cheesy approach to these creepy real-life incidents, as they have with all of our fears over the years. The actors are all superb in their performances, making scenes between the characters all the more terrifying and terrifying. While the special effects were very good, I wish the story could have been stretched to the extremes and done it justice, as it was a bit undercooked. The performances are all very good, the scares all very good, and the gore and violence all appropriately appropriate, but \"Paranormal Activity\" missed a huge opportunity to capture the public imagination like it truly deserves. As always with the Freddy franchise, there is just something about these movies that has something haunting about them, and this is an amazing horror that will go down in history as horror's great first entry. \"\n\nIf you're a fan of horror movies, there's no better way to experience this masterpiece than to watch this horror classic with your family & friends.

Now, with Agent 47 and the other remaining MIBs on the trail, the team are forced to work together to finally put an end to their enemies.\n\nIn addition to Slattery, the movie also featured the return of several characters from the first two installments, including James Remar as the series' lone female spy. This movie also got an R rating, so viewers should expect some scenes of strong violence.\n\n\"Men in Black II\"\n\nIn the first installment of the MIB trilogy, which also starred Remar, the team must stop a criminal conspiracy that may take the lives of not only Agent 47 and his colleagues, but the life of the future of humankind.\n\nThe team is joined by one of the film's best characters, the titular Men in Black (known as \"Sig\" in the movie).\n\nA lot of great action and plenty of action sequences took place in the story, which is the same as in the films' predecessors.\n\n\"Men in Black 3\"\n\nThis movie has also received high praise on our review of it from both the people who already saw the movie and from those who haven't.\n\nThe movie begins in 1998, when a group of scientists at S.T.A.R.

    "\"Dunkirk is a visually stunning and epic battle film, and one of the best to come out of war in the last decade. Directed by Christopher Nolan, this film is based on the book by Sir Arthur C. Clarke, which contains the story of Dunkirk, which the British forces lost in June 1940. The story in general revolves around a small group of British soldiers who attempt to defend the British island of Dunkirk from a German attack. During the battle, the British forces find themselves being held up for hours by the Germans, with no plan in place, and it is a losing battle until the help of the Dunkirk defenders arrives. For many years, the movie is known as the story of the British attempt to defend the British island. For those of us that watched the film in 3D, we are treated to this amazing aerial view of the destruction that Dunkirk was under at the hands of the Germans. To this day, this story is taught in schools around the World as a lesson on the bravery that men will show in the face of certain destruction. This is exactly what we are given in Dunkirk, but also a story of what happens when soldiers give their lives for a country, and in this instance, an entire island.\n\nThe film begins a bit slowly, but it gets worse from there as Nolan sets us down a path that we have seen before. With no clear plan, no real motivation for the men to help each other, and very little success in bringing some sense of unity to the men, it is the ultimate tragedy of Dunkirk. You can tell this movie was never very happy with how it came out. As I found my attention turning back to the screen at every scene that required my attention, I found myself wondering if Nolan could have saved this movie if he had just gone back to what really mattered in the story. What makes the film feel incomplete to me is the lack of action. Yes, there is a few action sequences (like the one where the British soldiers take cover from a German fire-bombing, but these do not last long and are completely un-earned), but their occurrence is very few and a few of them are completely out of context. The lack is more noticeable when Nolan tells the story of the battle at Dunkirk. There is no attempt at building any lasting emotions with the characters, nor do the characters use any of the",

It's not without its flaws, but with the right director, and the talent behind him, this movie will probably become a classic.\n\nI was going to write \"I'm going with 10/10\" but I'm being pulled along by the feelings surrounding it, not realizing I was already one step ahead.

    "A documentary about the birth of the Satanic Panic is always interesting, and that is no exception. The filmmaker of this movie, Michael L. Dorffeldt, was formerly a defense attorney, then a journalist, and has done several other similar films. Now there's a new movie (and a second-rate one at that) out on the subject. This one is called \"Rosemary's Baby,\" and, unfortunately, it is not an unusually interesting film in the ways of the genre. I would've preferred it to be more of a documentary than a movie. I think it has much to offer the discerning viewer, but I know I'll be unable to get through this film as planned.\n\nIt's quite possible that as of April 2007, \"Rosemary's Baby\" is the fifth least-popular film on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). I don't know how that compares to other movies in the genre, however. I have to figure that people that like the movie might get a kick out of other similar movies that are less-popular. I'll try to find out. In a separate review I'll compare it to \"Black Monday,\" \"Gods and Monsters,\" and \"Killer Bees.\" But the movie's popularity does not look much better in the other categories. It was also the least-popular film on Wikipedia — a website where users vote for the most popular entries about any movies and events, including movies that contain content the users don't like.\n\nFor the sake of comparison I used Wikipedia's own list of movies, \"Favourite Films of 2006.\" It is not entirely accurate, because the list doesn't define \"popular,\" but I think the film's popularity is accurate enough to compare to other movies within the same genre. The list has more than 1000 entries. \"Rosemary's Baby\" is the sixth-most frequently nominated movie. This means that on the list of top contenders in that specific genre, \"Rosemary's Baby\" is listed under movies about Satanic crimes. Not in the good movies class, either — the top five entries are those about good movies.\n\nThe film's popularity appears to follow a kind of trend. \"Killer Bee,\" for example, is also a documentary from a former lawyer (Dorffeldt, for those who don't know) but this one doesn't involve a fictional story, no fictional",
    "After he and his wife, the film's star, are wrongly convicted of murdering their daughter, Mark (Matthew McConaughey) has the good sense to hire lawyer Brian (Farrar, Straus and Giroux's Barry Levinson), who offers to take them off the hook using a novel defense: he will represent them pro bono. The first time, in a Florida courtroom, the decision works, and the following two times, in the New York courtroom, the defense falls by the wayside. In a final case, the couple travel to New Orleans to defend the conviction against an old high school nemesis, played by Woody Harrelson, and another high school football buddy (Robert Forster), a man who made the same mistake Mark did: not believing in lawyers. At the close, the lawyer in the movie doesn't know what to do; after all, who would choose to use a lawyer when there is such an obvious solution? Mark eventually decides not to take the deal; they'll either fight and win or die fighting. \"Dallas Buyers Club\" is an unflinching drama, of the sort few of us would wish ever existed, but its subject matter is more pressing than it might seem. The movie's hero, protagonist Dallas Buyers Club (McConaughey), plays for the Buffalo Bills in the National Football League, and it is that play, a \"blind\" pick-up game, that leads to his incarceration and ultimately, his eventual release.\n\nTo be fair, we have reviewed the movie (click here to read it). The following is the original review submitted:\n\nMcConaghy is a true playwright of the most uncompromising generation, with a gift for character, for drama and, of course, for the good old fashioned American \"gutter drama.\" No critic of any stripe would be capable of assigning a higher grade to his first film. What his third attempt, from a \"lesser studio\" has to offer is a movie that is more than the sum of its parts. With the exception of a brilliant performance by McConaghy, there is not a single redeeming quality in this film worth the price of admission. One doesn't feel that anything good must have happened - one must be kidding - or there would be no \"Dallas Buyers Club\" in the first place, not \"Dallas Buyers Club\"",
    "I went into this movie expecting a lot, despite the fact that I was expecting to be disappointed. The last two TFW films from the movies I've been in have been very bad at least and this is yet another one of them….the music just feels so dated. I don't know if they just haven't made any new music during the 20 years they've been making movies or if they just forgot all about it but it just doesn't work for me. And the fact that their voice actors were all so terrible and in bad roles, like the man playing Optimus Prime (Ed Lautner, he plays a douchebag with a beard), the \"human\" lead who doesn't actually talk, and most notably, the human woman whose voice I think I can pronounce just fine but that almost always means my reaction to her mouth is, \"What the hell is she saying?\" is also why I found myself getting bored and trying to not take things seriously and just have fun with the movie, which I've done plenty before….\n\nI know I'm the only one that said, \"Dude, this isn't even remotely fun!\" because I went into this movie with such high expectations! It was going to be the year of the Transformers and the most \"Transformative\" movie ever….\n\nWell, the movie doesn't even bother trying at times.\n\nLook at the plot.\n\nThe entire movie takes place on the bridge of an old cruise ship. There's a bunch of \"Transformers\" (I suppose you can call them \"carnivorous life forms\" since they all have animal features such as tails and fins) in the form of humans (mostly women with their bodies wrapped up in some sort of cybernetic construct or something) who are riding in the ship as it begins to breakdown.

    "When my dad and granddad decided to buy the small farm in north central Iowa that they shared in the 60s, they were both working, but Dad would go out in the fields all day, while Mom cooked for him. I love that Mom would cook, but I don't think my dad enjoyed it either. So I feel a bit of guilt when he was gone, since he was gone so much. But he wasn't out there to play golf or make beer or watch horse races—he was out there working to support our family. That's why I love Mary, that in a couple of scenes, she lets the guys know she's not in the mood; she was just doing everything she could to make the men happy.\n\nThen she's trying to make a run for it when the two guys are leaving, and she jumps onto them and gives them a kiss. It's really simple—it looks like she's trying to seduce them and then they'll be happy for her. But they are not! They are happy because she showed that she's willing to help, not just get a kiss, but a loving hug. She can't let it come off that way—this is love, for them this will be the last goodbye—so she lets them know she loves them and then she leaves to be home. It's all about that trust factor, and the way that they were not willing to leave her there, and knowing that she would come home to see them.\n\nI loved this movie because it looked like they were really there for each other. That they really enjoyed each other's company and looked for things to do off-camera.

    "When your film stars both Marlon Brando and Omar Sharif, the odds are even more stacked against the film that is reviewed. This time, though, it's Marlon Brando's turn to step out and lead the way in the war against the Algiers jihadi group. His character, Colonel Calley, is just one of the many characters who comes together in what should be a film rife with action and drama. But rather than providing this through great performances, the only one of interest is Omar Sharif, who is essentially portrayed by a drunk. Sharif's character is basically in his early twenties and spends most of the film walking around aimlessly. This type of character, then, doesn't really show up in most war films so there isn't much of one to be found here either. So, what does that leave?

    "The story of No Country for Old Men revolves around John Marston and a pair of outlaws called the \"White Legs.\" Marston has an interesting family backstory, as he was raised by an abusive father and an alcoholic mother. He and the White Legs are the only people he meets who treat him as an equal, and he learns to appreciate humans more than he ever has before. The story plays with the theme that, to truly understand what humans are truly capable is to consider their past. Many who consider themselves to be good in one way or another take their past sins out on others. To Marston, he takes the White Legs' past sins out on himself, and he feels it's unfair that he should go to prison for a crime he didn't commit. This plays a big part in the way Marston is portrayed. Despite his harshness towards people, he is very much trying to protect his family, and when he is in a position to do so (e.g. at the beginning in the story), he does so. This leads to the story, after Marston turns against the White Legs and kills them to avoid a situation like the one that led his family to him, as well as what is referred to as the \"Tru\" ending from the book. The book ends with Marston taking his own life, but this doesn't happen to this movie. To go back to my review for the book where I praised \"Dead Snow\" for its depiction of Marston, I'll say I liked this movie most for its portrayal of Marston. Even though he never changes his character in this movie, I think his change was well done considering the circumstances.\n\nOverall, the movie \"No Country for Old Men\" is really underrated. While the story doesn't exactly set the world on fire, the cinematography and acting are top notch. For those that didn't see the book, I'd suggest giving this movie a look, and I promise you'll be hooked.",
    "\"When he was hired to play the villain in the Terminator franchise, Arnold Schwarzenegger had to prove his acting capabilities. That test came in \"The Terminator,\" the 1984 film sequel to the 1984 hit, and the sequel to the 1984 movie, too. Written by John McClaughry, the second film in the franchise, is a bit of a mess. With Schwarzenegger unable to do more than deliver a few lines of dialogue and a handful of kills per hour, the role was too much for a mere bodybuilder with a handful of film credits to call his own. \"The Terminator\" is all Schwarzenegger. With a little over an hour to devote to his plot and three to kill hundreds of people, he's given ample to do. It would be a shame for the character to be shortchanged because Schwarzenegger couldn't do what he was cast to do. His physical abilities are an asset, he's just not the right actor to play T-800. \"The Terminator\" is far from a great motion picture, but at least it's still entertaining and entertaining when it is. By the end of the short story that Schwarzenegger was given, he had proved that he was truly one of Hollywood's most versatile actors, able to play most any role, but none better than the title character. Schwarzenegger was the perfect actor to play the antagonist, having been a top-notch action star his whole life, and being able to take on and survive a movie like \"The Terminator\" is impressive. Schwarzenegger shows what he can do when no one is looking, and when those around him keep asking for his autograph it is one of the most enjoyable activities anyone has ever had.\" (IMDb.com)\n\nRene Da Costa\n\nRene Da Costa is a Brazilian actor.

    "For a movie whose director is an African-American, \"Mudbound\" does a remarkable job of representing a white perspective on race. The director, first-time filmmaker Dee Rees, uses two perspectives that many Americans struggle to get a handle on: a black person who grew up in a town where no one was really afraid of them and who went on to make it big in Hollywood and a white woman turned actor who knows exactly why the town she's from isn't such a great place to live — you can't just turn on the television and expect it to be OK. In a city where people have their roots and roots are deep, this movie asks why America's rural centers are so often abandoned by cities and towns and people have such narrow definition of who they are and where they belong.\n\nThere are great performances, which go to Jay Duplass (as a white rural couple whose marriage and lifestyle crumble when their son is born with an inoperable brain tumor), Jake Gyllenhaal (\"Who is the bigger bully in this story, the kid who grew up in the same house as Muddy is or the one whose dad can't stop yelling at him?\"), and Paul Dano as a young woman who, like Mudbound herself, can be a reluctant hero.\n\nThe cast has been criticized by some for being too white. That critique is fair. This movie could be more realistic with more diverse voices: Jay Duplass, Adepero Oduye, and Gary Oldman certainly could have filled out their roles. Still, this movie is a reminder that if you know how to make a movie, there is nothing you can't do.\n\n\"Mudbound\" is available in local theaters nationwide.\n\nAdvertisements",
    "A train runs a little over three miles (four kilometers) from Seoul to Busan, but it will make a shorter trip for some of your colleagues in the movie, Train to Busan, now available on DVD for the first time in 13 years.\n\nK-Pop girl group Girls' Generation, led by singer and songwriter Jessica, is given a gift-wrapped train, loaded with the latest in technology as the newest member, Hani, meets it at The Seoul Metro. The other members and staff are skeptical at first, as the train is not on schedule but has a ticket, and there are a lot of people on the train, causing many to want to switch seats. But as Hani moves forward, she begins to understand the \"value\" of such a train with her special, unique set of abilities, a gift she brings along from her childhood in Japan. After the passengers get into the train, Hani explains further on the value of train travel as a way for people of all interests, talents and abilities to connect, to have fun and to have some fun together.\n\nThe film doesn't have a plot, but it's clear that the movie is all about people and their love and connection to the train, through the characters, who share their love for trains. The relationships of the main characters (Chaeyoo, Daehoon and Namjeong) and the staff members are more meaningful and more real, like in the movie, than in real life. There are scenes on the train with many emotions: a mother and daughter who are waiting for their train, couples, families, kids and friends. Some scenes are more dramatic, like a conversation between the conductor and a pregnant woman, and it's shown that many women like to have a train waiting for them at home to get them home quicker.\n\nThe characters are diverse and diverse, and the relationship between different characters from different age groups and culture is really moving.

Based on a true story, the film follows Chiwetel Ejiofor as David Levinson in his most complex yet beloved role as well as a role which may change his career as an actor or change his life forever. With this movie, director Ryan Reynolds and screenwriter (and \"Lone Survivor\" screenwriter) Todd Phillips created the modern superhero on his heels by making all of the stories feel like true films. Cinematographer Benoît Delhomme (Hacksaw Ridge, \"The Revenant\") and Editor Michael De Luca (\"OJ: Made in America\") add a different perspective and take a different approach as they weave these different perspectives together to create a stunningly cinematic vision for \"Unbreakable.\" The film brings together multiple narratives, including that of the real-life David Levinson (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor), taking him from his prison cell to his home. The film also has a plotline focusing on the daughter of a man who is currently under house arrest for his involvement with the September 11 terrorist attacks. He is an ex-convict who worked for the FBI and eventually became sympathetic to their mission of apprehending the members of al Qaeda. With this background and time in prison and in the present, director Ryan Reynolds and his writing team provide an intimate portrait to make it feel like it's all real.

    "\"Man on the Moon\" is a science fiction adventure film directed by Stanley Kubrick and written by Arthur C. Clarke.\n\nIf this isn't your cup of tea, you might want to try the other films of Arthur C. Clarke: \"Innocence of Muslims,\" \"The Sentinel\", and \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"\n\n\"Man on the Moon\" focuses on the journey of an astronaut, played by Dustin Hoffman, who returns to Earth with the intention of becoming a movie star. Hoffman plays a former baseball star (played by James Brolin) who goes on to become a professor at a university when he witnesses the fatal crash of a test rocket launched by the U.S. government a couple years prior.\n\nI guess I could see the similarities with \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". But the film also plays off of Kubrick's signature style of science fiction. We've already seen \"2001.\" This looks more like a \"Close Encounters\", but no one in the film is like Kubrick's Dr. David Bowman. And don't be fooled by the title. This story is fictional.\n\nThe movie opens with a scene from the film \"2001\" that is referenced here. The scene plays over two shots of the moon, which were recorded for the original film. The first is of the film's director, Stanley Kubrick, filming the film's most iconic scene, a shot of the giant star, which stands on an enormous platform and is surrounded by a ring of fire. Kubrick then cuts to a close up of a face, wearing a long-sleeved white suit and an eyepiece.\n\nA character is on the moon in a white spacesuit. The character is dressed in a \"spacesuit\" of sorts, because the character is wearing a spacesuit that was \"brought back from the moon\" and that is \"from the moon from the moon.\"\n\nThe movie's tagline is \"A new space age, a new dawn.\" One thing that I find really interesting is that the tagline describes the film in terms of the end of the Apollo 11 landings: \"The last man on the moon.\"\n\nThe crew, played by the members of the cast, include Harrison Ford, Dustin Hoffman, and Bill Pullman. The story follows a story about astronaut Hoffman's journey from having a baseball career, to a post",
    "\"As with all great sequels, the problem with another vanilla update is that it can't make up its own mind as to when it's trying to rewind. Vanilla Sky is basically a movie that was originally made for moviegoers who have already seen the original but who want to experience the first director's cut, a version that may already be out of print or at least out of print on the rental system you're considering paying big bucks for. The movie's director has been fired, the story of its characters lost to the sands of time, and the whole thing will end with a grand farewell. Vanilla Sky is a movie that was too good to be true. A great story, a beautiful cast, a great trailer—we all loved it when it was first released, and now it may have been overrated for being a remake. If you like great old-school movies with bad endings (or even old-school movies with great endings), Vanilla Sky is available in either standard or 2.35:1 in standard definition…If you're a fan of the original Vanilla Sky (1992), which featured a star-studded cast, a dark story, and an alluring romantic chemistry between lead Matthew McConaughey and star-studded-plummer Kristen Stewart, then this classic sequel is exactly what you've been waiting for.\n\n…But even if you're a fan of the original, a lot of your friends won't be, and you might be willing to give it another chance. We would. Here's a few things to keep in mind when you go see Vanilla Sky—or else skip it altogether:\n\n1. When it came out the first time, Vanilla Sky was considered a sleeper hit—a sleeper that many of us were still unaware was on the way. What the movie lacked in critical and box-office success it made up for in nostalgia and general awesomeness. If you are a longtime fan and think your taste has shifted a bit since 1993, or if you simply want something entirely different, you should check this one out. We're confident it won't disappoint.\n\n2. Despite many claims, there is nothing original about this movie. The story is loosely based on the novel \"A Simple Guide,\" written by the late David Baldacci, and has been a perennial favorite with the author's devoted fans. What's more, the",
    "The Last Song (2016)\n\nThe Last Song (2016)\n\nThe Last Song (2016)\n\nThe Last Song is a film about how songs change everything, what they mean and how we experience them. This film is by Canadian filmmaker Jameson Parker. \"The Last Song\" opens with a man on a flight from Toronto to Vancouver. He takes a seat next to a man who just watched the documentary \"The Day I Live This\", about a man who makes videos about his life and ends up disappearing and being seen by thousands after the plane crashes. The man is seen sitting at the edge of the plane on a ledge. A girl is standing next to him, smiling, and they play some music together. Then, the girl looks at him and takes his hand, and they pull each step closer together, making room for the man to climb up the ledge and leap from it to the next platform. This is how the film opens; we don't know anymore. But in the next few minutes the man jumps down and we're transported to a room with an old man sitting at a desk whose chair is covered with a red carpet. He is talking to a reporter who has written an article about someone who died and they want him to comment. The man has written this response but hasn't turned around to see what it is because he can't. He is an expert on \"The Last Song\", who, because someone has stolen his song, is in hiding and he's been put in the room to record his statement. Then the woman comes into the room and tells him he has 15-20 minutes until the end, and he has to record an answer or it will be too late. If he doesn't record the answer, he won't be able to give the song to the press, so he decides he doesn't have much time. When he hears the woman calling his name he thinks to himself \"Oh, shit.\" and runs outside with the reporter following him and he tells him their plan and goes into hiding for the moment.\n\nThis is how The Last Song begins. It's an intro to a movie about a man who will only say the name \"Song\" and when he talks \"Song\" will come back to the man. After the film is over it will take the audience on a journey where they will learn more about this man and other people around the world who talk",
    "\"In Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning blockbuster 'Schindler's List', Max von Essen, a German soldier in World War II, saves over 1,000 Jews trapped by the Nazis in a Russian cattle pen. Spielberg's true-life story of the rescue and the role it played in the Allied victory is a harrowing epic drama. The film is based on the true story of Heinrich Josef Schindler, the German businessman who organized the largest mass rescue of Jews in history, creating the largest labor crew in peacetime. In the book Schindler's Ark, published in Germany in 1988, historian Ernst Nolte explains how Schindler's plan began with the help of his wife, Eva, and children. Through his involvement in the project, Schindler would become the most successful businessman in the world in the post-war era. Schindler had a vision to rescue Jews who were held in concentration camps, where the bodies of those who were killed in the gas chambers might still rotted on the premises. Schindler was inspired by the true story of an earlier mass resettlement of Jews to Poland by the SS, and he thought that he would be able to save more. He found the necessary financing through his brother-in-law, the Hungarian-born businessman Georg Richter, who, at the end of the war, was convicted of war crimes against Jews. The film, written and directed by Steven Spielberg, is based on a true story and chronicles the complex plot. In the beginning of the film we watch several of the Schindler team arriving in the Polish capital and meeting with members of the local Jewish community for the purpose of making the necessary preparations. In a flashback we see the three surviving sons, Max (played by Michael Caine), Oskar (played by Christopher Plummer) and Olaf (played by Daniel Craig), arriving in Germany to become soldiers for their father. The story then takes us back to the years following the war. Max is in a POW camp, the Nazis order his family to leave, and he is captured by the Russians. He is smuggled to Poland and finally to Budapest, where he finds out his family has emigrated. When his brother-in-law is arrested as a war criminal, he is forced to leave their home and the group. However, he is still able to gather information as a means to help",
    "The movie \"Leo the Professional\" was a good movie. It took a lot of courage to make it, as most of us would rather watch another TV production to go there. It was an amazing and courageous move. I would say that to make an important movie like this without a lot of money could happen only if you know what you are doing or if you were a very skilled director. Of course with \"Léon: The Professional\" we don't know. If I had known what I was doing, I would have never started on this movie like I did. The cinematographer was Olivier Bressan, who is an old friend of mine and who I worked with also recently on a TV show. I didn't really know who this guy was before seeing the movie, as he was only a name in some magazines. I saw the movie a few years ago and, seeing who it is now, I said to myself that this person can shoot well. So I contacted Olivier and we spoke about many things since. We never really agreed on everything, but once I knew this man, it was easy for me to work with him. He's a great collaborator. Olivier always works faster than me, because he doesn't want me to stop. When I told this guy to \"put the camera down\", he said \"what do you mean? It's supposed to be playing.\" To him this was not so much difficult as difficult for me, because I'm too smart to lose control of the camera. After my shooting of the movie, Olivier contacted me and said that he had a wonderful sequence in mind that I wanted to shoot, but that there were some problems to overcome, such as time constraints. So I asked Olivier to give me a few days to solve all the problems we had and we agreed to do it together. But what I didn't know is that the whole sequence was just a fake, because the movie would have been ruined if we had shot it because what we planned was a film noir. If one guy has the sequence, why would he show it to me when we were planning something else, when the film is supposed to be a drama? On the other hand, that sequence was my choice and I would love to shoot it myself. So I said to Olivier that I am the one that decides what goes in \"Leo a la période",

    "In \"21 Jump Street,\" a series of unlikely events lead three unlikely people – a cop, a former criminal and a former bouncer – on a frantic chase that could send a city in chaos. This new comedy from writer-director Jon M. Chu focuses on some serious issues faced by a young men's club in New York City, which has seen its fair share of fights and crimes.\n\nThe movie begins with a group of young men coming together to form an athletic club called Ruckus, which will compete in the city's biggest Jump Street jump. The club's founder, Nick (Jon Favreau), hopes this kind of competition will bring an influx of dollars into their nightclub, but a few people have other ideas. As they head to the event, they must keep a few things in mind as the race unfolds. With time running out, they must not only remain together, but also take on the criminal underworld, which has a plan to try and prevent them from winning the competition. As this battle between good and evil intensifies, they're forced to confront the fact that, after all, they are nothing without one another. This film was made on a limited budget, yet Chu created a fantastic environment for the film. As far as the action is concerned, the movie is all about choreography and stunts. It's also impressive with its script and themes of friendship and trust, as they are developed throughout the movie.\n\nAllusions to the film's plot and themes are scattered throughout the movie. One of the movie's characters even makes a reference to the character played by Will Ferrell in \"The Lego Movie.\" The movie uses a similar idea; one of the characters is a boxer named Benny, is nicknamed \"The Black Mamba\" by the guys. The main character, Detective Jake Bergman (Channing Tatum), is dressed as a boxer in the movie.\n\nAlthough the movie does have many serious issues with its themes, it's well made, highly entertaining, and funny. The movie's story focuses on its two main characters, Jake Bergman, a cop investigating a series of murders, and Ron Howard's Ron Burgundy, who is an Olympic-level boxer who competes for a boxing organization. Both men are struggling to make a positive impact in their worlds, while trying to take on society's problems. This movie isn't perfect; however, it shows a",

It's a great first teaser.\n\nThe second teaser, entitled \"Nekromantik\" introduces us to the central protagonist: a little girl, played by Daniela Hanka, who lives in an isolated house made out of a giant chess piece and is raised by her grandmother, the grandmother of a \"master\".\n\nThe grandmother is in her thirties and very advanced for her own time, but she suffers from an incurable illness.

The movies feature a child protagonist, played by the 8-year-old twins, Jack and Shannon, who discover they've been transported to the nightmarish Land Before Christmas.

The movie came out in the U.S. in November, and it's expected to generate approximately $80 million at the box office.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe film is based on the Roald Dahl books about the Christmas apocalypse that were written in the 1940s. The story follows Snow White, the fairy-tale heroine who has to find her way home from the Land Before Christmas via a snow globe that the evil Prince Hans has taken away.\n\nWhile Dahl's other books drew the vast majority of their audience from girls, The Nightmare Before Christmas's male readership is surprisingly close to the male readership from the original books, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nDreamWorks SKG CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg said in a statement that the movie's new twist is based on a popular Christmas tradition: \"The Nightmare Before Christmas is the story of a boy who journeys to the Land before Christmas to rescue two little sisters he believes to have been kidnapped by the villain, the Red King.

    "Apocalypse Now is one of the most popular and influential (even if not entirely accurate) movies on the internet from the 1960's. So it should come as no surprise that when looking for a movie with the name 'Apocalypse' in the title, I was pretty disappointed. The list of 'Apocalypse' movies seems endless and there is no doubt in my mind that we will all see one day a movie entitled, \"Apocalypse Now\" that will be equal or greater in popularity and impact than its predecessors. The best way I can describe this book is with a cheesy '80's action film of the same name. It's a slow paced, cheesy, generic plot that will get repetitive and repetitive by the third act.\n\nAt the end of the book the main character is captured by the Vietnamese, and his captors attempt to torture him with a variety of torture devices, methods and equipment, but to no avail. Eventually they offer to show him a part of Vietnam that he hasn't been able to go on vacation to before; however, the main character refuses because he believes that he is being shown a distorted version of his hometown in Cambodia. He states: \"This is not really my home. It is this one. This is where my friends and family are. This is where I learned to fight and kill.\"\n\nIt is no shock when it is revealed that both characters are correct…the Vietnam War wasn't really a Vietnam War, it was the Vietnam-Era. For most people who lived during that decade or so there won't be a real-life counterpart to the people in the movie. It is not realistic or realistic as we know or remember it. Of course any great book or movie is better than no book or movie at all, but in my opinion this movie will most likely reach greater audience, if only because it is so enjoyable to watch.\n\nI have read a good amount of books and films in my time, so I would imagine I have seen most film and novel adaptations of books before. However, this was the first time that I had seen an adaptation that had the type of a movie that should be made into a book.\n\nThis was my first introduction to what is today considered the \"Classic Author/Movie\" dichotomy.

    "Synopsis: A romantic comedy about the life of four friends – two of whom are the opposite gender from the main characters – whose quest for one another puts them into situations that test their relationships and friendships. (Novice)\n\nRating: 7 – Not Recommended, because it does not fulfill the film's main premise.\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nPlot Synopsis: \"Bros before hos.\" But it doesn't seem like everyone's taken that advice. On the eve of the \"ultimate bachelor\", Hugh Grant and Catherine Zeta-Jones are in a romantic clinch that could decide who winds up with whom. Zeta-Jones finds herself at the center of the story, while Grant is seen as the most attractive man in London, a city known as \"The Most Beautiful City in the World.\" As for the rest of the group, Harry Knowles is handsome, but not much more. He's always looking to break up the group's romantic détente and then go for the one he's really into. Mark Rylance shows off all the tricks that come with that big heart.\n\nWhat really sets this movie apart from other romcoms is the casting. Colin Firth plays the charismatic but somewhat insecure David Brent. His performance is a mix of both a bit of a self-deprecating but humorous self-questioning and a sort of unrepentant but sincere acceptance of who he is. Firth brings a manly warmth and manly depth to the role, and he puts the movie on point as he walks through the city with Brent on their journey.\n\nAlso starring Oscar Isaac and Bill Nighy, \"Love Actually\" is a fun but flawed romantic comedy about the life of four friends – two of whom are the opposite gender from the main characters – whose quest for one another puts them into situations that test their relationships and friendships.

    "The story starts with the murder of a New York state legislator named Joseph Cianci. The killer has never been identified and no suspect has been picked up as of yet. Cianci was killed at his Albany, New York home because his wife found a note that said in part;\n\nI'm a hit man for the Mob,\n\nI know where to find you,\n\nI am the one that killed you.\n\nThe note also left a note warning that the hit man would come for two other Albany legislators that had been killed. And then he would come for the wife of one of the dead legislators.\n\nCianci's wife, Claudia, quickly takes matters into her own hands and travels to Albany, the capital city of New York and also the home of the politician who had been murdered. When she reaches the mob boss who was behind the murder of her husband, all is not what it seems. For one, the politician was one of Cianci's good friends and had been part of his political team when Cianci was the state's Assemblyman.\n\nThe hit man was actually a man named Vito Spatafore who came to Albany from New York City. While working as an agent for the F.B.I., Vito spied on Cianci, his wife, and others he thought was related to Cianci (this is an excerpt from the movie). While Claudia is getting ready to go to Albany to identify and capture the hit man, a second letter arrives in the mail. This letter states, \"Your husband and he are about to go to court, where our friend Vito will be forced to testify against them.\" This \"friend\" was none other than Tony Soprano.\n\nThe movie will end with the testimony of Cianci's good friend. Soprano was hired by Vito to eliminate Cianci, his wife, and the politicians who were murdered. Claudia arrives in Albany and sees that Vito is already there and she has no choice but to turn around and run. Claudia gets her two young daughters to safety as she rushes to the Capitol's entrance and runs through the city to find her husband.",
    "One thing we can't help but notice during this epic journey is the music used throughout the length of the story, ranging from an acoustic guitar of the early 90's era, to more modern versions with keyboards.\n\nThe film's music, created by composer Lucretio de Micheli (who composed some of the Italian \"Giovanni's Modus Operandi\" scores), is really quite gorgeous.\n\nEven though the score of \"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom\" has not been premiered in Europe, this music has indeed already garnered a lot of praise within Italy, the US and Europe.\n\nThe movie's main theme has been compared to \"Everest\" by composer Tadao Nagasawa.\n\nThe movie is rated PG-13 by The Motion Picture Association of America.\n\nThe movie premiered at the Rome Opera House, and the official trailer can be seen below.\n\nMore Info:\n\nhttp://www.movieloveronline.com/en/movie-score/salo-or-the-120-days-of-sodom-from-mario-fils-to-lucretio-de-micheli\n\nhttp://www.imdb.se/film/sal-0661577/\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lucretiodem Micheli",
    "\"When we have come such a long way, the time has come to stop and really look back. And the film \"A Beautiful Mind\" offers the perfect opportunity. The film, which opens on Feb. 21 in the U.S., is a biographical look at the life of British physicist and mathematical genius, mathematician and physicist John Nash, and takes us back to his childhood years, when he was very different from whom we're familiar today. His teacher and mentor gave him special powers that led John to become a gifted student of all the areas of mathematics, science and technology. The film explores this early years of John, shows him progressing in all of his academic areas, starting with elementary school and working his way up to university and his famous mathematical career, which led to his being awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics. As he talks to us about his life story, both in the context of his scientific work and as a regular person, the film allows us to experience the full spectrum of John Nash, as he was at various stages of his life, beginning his scientific career as a high school student in Chicago and then going on to university, to his professional and, more importantly, social achievements as a mathematician and philanthropist as well as a husband, a father and a grandfather.\"\n\nCheck out the full review below.",
    "\"When Harry Met Sally...\" is an entertaining adaptation of a popular children's book by Lewis Carroll, featuring Sally and the Cheshire Cat, starring Bill Murray as Harry and Michael Caine as Sally. When it comes to these classic fables, \"Harry & Sally,\" directed by Andrew Adamson was no slouch. In fact, the movie might be more fun than the books... At least from the vantage point of the audience, which includes adults, children and even teenagers. I know I was laughing for the majority of the movie's running time. The dialogue wasn't always funny, but the action scenes, as expected from \"The Wizard of Oz\" trilogy, were extremely well-done. My personal favorite was when Sally and Harry were caught by the police... I'm not sure if I've laughed at the pointy end of a cat's carrot in my life, but this, I found, was right up my alley! And the ending at the very end, when the cops are finally able to arrest and convict the Cat himself, was both a fitting and thrilling ending.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, then join my newsletter!

    "\"Saul Williams is about to enter the fifth century.\"\n\n\n\"An ancient sorcerer is determined to return from the grave to rule the Earth, but his resurrection journey may have just gone horribly wrong. With no other choice, he summons an old friend, a black snake named Sam, who believes he and his tribe of men are the only ones capable of returning King Arthur back to his rightful realm. With Sam's help, they begin to search for a treasure known as the Black Stone that might be able to stop Merlin from resurrecting the sorcerer.\"\n\n\n\"The Black Stone.\"\n\n\n\"A priceless treasure of mystical powers, it was given to Arthur by the legendary King Solomon and wielded by the wizard Merlin. The last wizard to possess the Stone, Merlin was cast out for his use of magic. The other three wizards sought to use the Stone to return to their own kingdoms and become gods. With their betrayal by their own creations as their reason for continuing working, they were destroyed.\"\n\n\n\"In the fifth century, King Solomon's beloved wife, Gwen, sends her half-sister Gwenhwyfar to retrieve the Stone for her to take back to Camelot. Although she believes she has succeeded, she is actually led to the ancient Black Cave by a man who claims to be Merlin – his own brother!\"\n\n\n\"A massive boulder grows out of the stone and smashes the two brothers, Merlin's spirit surviving to confront Merlin and claim the Stone for himself. Merlin escapes to a fortress near a powerful magical forest of trees, where he forms a powerful bond with the trees on which he is sheltered and grows his powers to become even stronger. But Merlin's plan for the Stone begins to unravel when Gwen returns to Camelot and the other wizards return to their kingdoms, one by one, to retrieve the Stone for themselves. With Merlin fighting to keep the Stone from Merlin's brother, Morgan le Fay, Merlin turns against his own people and fights to protect the Stone from the invaders!\"\n\n\n\"The battle to keep the Stone from Morgan and her army of monsters and dragons reaches climax when a new race of the ancient race of humans, the Tuatha De Danann, arrives and begins the first great war upon the earth that continues for centuries. But it is not only the land of fairy tales and fairytales that is threatened by Merlin. A war is waged on the moon",
    "\"This may be the best movie in the Harry Potter series, but it is also by no means the best Harry Potter. Many people have complained that it lacks story, and even characters. I haven't gotten to this movie because I had to attend church that afternoon, so I can't talk about it. But I'd be delighted to talk about it. This movie shows that there is no single right way to write an Harry Potter tale, and that's a good thing. Every one of the books has elements that don't quite gel with each other, but I'd love to watch a movie about a group of friends who meet under very unusual circumstances, and how their lives begin to change and shape each other.\n\nWhat I will note is that there are some pretty odd choices about the way that characters are depicted. For instance, Ginny is an evil woman, and she kills innocent people; however, Professor McGonagall shows more compassion toward the people around her than is justified because she is a teacher and therefore acts a bit like that anyway. Harry is too selfish, but Ron is portrayed as the \"good brother\". I personally have never been all that fond of either Harry of those two boys, and I personally think it was better for them to die than for them to never see each other again. But maybe that's just my opinion.\n\n\"But it is a nice thing about the way they are all depicted in this movie, however. I think J.K. Rowling, or someone at her, carefully crafted their characters so that their actions would not surprise people. So Ron isn't always the one going to a party and getting his arse handed to him by a date, and so Hermione isn't always the one who's dating the guy who beat Cedric Diggory. This helps people connect to the characters, regardless of their choices; they're still good people, they're not always bad, and some people are more heroic than others.\n\nAnd it's nice to look at everyone's personalities in a movie such as this. Dumbledore, Ron, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny all have their own unique charms, and they all have their own quirks. Some people may think that Ron and Hermione have too similar personalities to be a good match, but the fact that you see that even though they're in different years shows that they're just close enough in",
    "\"As if they were both on a team, a powerful young wizard named Harry Potter and the young heir of a prominent British wizarding family face-off in the final film of the seven-film series. Although not an original idea, the film is considered to be the pinnacle of the Potter mythos and is a must-see for longtime fans. …This film is an adventure, but it's also a story, in which a small story of bravery and friendship is told—with a surprising twist that is satisfying but certainly not predictable. This film is the perfect ending for the series, and it's a fitting one.

    "\"Hereditary follows the life of a man who has been married twice. He is an alcoholic whose first wife was murdered with a hatchet, his second wife was found with brain damage and he now has a child, who has a serious and fatal injury and would otherwise be alive. It is a very powerful film that is not for all audiences. It is also a very disturbing film as it depicts a man (Jared Leto) who knows the pain of separation very well and is very much at war when he is separated from his wife.

    "\"Gone with the Wind takes all of its cues from Gone with the Wind for the most part. There is no shortage of \"great\" moments in this film and none of them are bad ones. I'm not going to be the one to say \"this is a good film,\" but I do think the film works as the story is told. The major downfall of this film in my opinion is in the middle. We're treated to a lot of \"plot\" but it is as generic as the plot itself. We are constantly told that the war's over and all is peace for the Southerners. And then what happens? Civil war, a war to decide whose side I should be on and my favorite movie (Cameron's) gets dragged into it? It's boring as all get out. They may have used a bit of a \"dramatic\" approach but I think the end had the best possible ending. I don't say that it is perfect by any means,\"\n\nAdvertisements",
    "This is the story of two sisters, who have lived in a small New York town all their lives. One sister, Susan Kates (Vera Farmiga) has always been somewhat of a loner. In the early days of school she left and spent several months in Alaska, not speaking to anyone. She never talks or acts any more. All of her sisters are close friends with Susan, and none of her sisters know all the secrets that she keeps. The other sister and her husband, James (Ricky Gervais), are separated and living in a different location. He's an alcoholic. A jealous and manipulative woman, she often pretends to be his mother to get him to do things that they would both much rather not.\n\nSusan Kates is a woman in black, trying to keep the community in hiding as she was a fugitive herself, and a prostitute from her teens. She is a realist, and a professional. Her greatest fear is for the safety of her children, her mother and her sister. James would rather forget her. On the other hand, Susan's children, Amy (Lights), and Katie (Alicia Silverstone, the mother of Amy) were very young at the time of their mother's disappearance. They lived with her for time, and have grown up very attached to her. Katie is the only one who can remember the day she last spoke to her mother. Amy is a mother to two very healthy girls (Bryan Cranston and Eva Green). The older girls have moved into the country with her and her husband, and both are perfectly happy with their mother.\n\nThe film opens in the days after Susan Kates' disappearance. Some of her friends come into the village and discover her car. They take away the bodies. All of the locals are baffled that she would be taken away. They only assume she was taken because of the money she left behind.\n\nThe film then moves into the present, the mother of one of the Kates women (Carrie Coon) is on a television show and she claims to have information about Susan's disappearance. She goes back to the town to show it to the people. She does not provide any of the information she has. The film then follows Amy and Katie's mom as she tries to find out what Susan Kates is up to. Through Katie's mom Amy becomes involved in",
    "So here's the most recent update on \"This is the End.\" We first heard about the story for the movie this morning when director Andy Muschietti emailed out this link: \"It's about the end of the world as we know it, but the world is actually not the end. In fact, the world doesn't end — more specifically, there's another Earth somewhere out there called E.T.S. and it's the same as this one: you go there. It's not as bleak. I suppose my main concern for you guys is just that it's not very good.\"\n\nAnd for you haters, it kind of is the same as this movie.\n\nThe good news is that the end of the world isn't really that awesome. (Spoiler: don't plan on watching it if you don't like apocalyptic movies.) I have a feeling the movie won't play as well with kids, or at the very least won't be for everyone they bring it to.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it actually sucks. For starters, unlike the books, the plot is still fairly well-developed, at least from what Muschietti has told us so far (he hasn't divulged much). A friend of mine recently went to see the movie with his three-year-old son and his two-year-old brother. While reading the book, I had to remind myself that this was the same kid who thought \"The Sound of Music\" was a \"cute\" musical, so I think this is kind of a great representation of what kind of movie it can be for all ages.\n\nThe movie also manages to stay true to the tone and plot of the source fiction. (Though you probably have already figured that out.) Like the book, it follows a group of people, almost all of whom seem like they would make for a pretty odd couple, who crash a UFO in the woods in what is essentially a horror story. But all that is pretty far removed from the original story — in fact, that's one of it's biggest strengths, in my opinion.\n\nThe good news, aside from the fact that it just kind of has a very similar tone, is that it can easily be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their background or interest. I don't think, like a lot of those \"what if the world ended?\" movies",
    "\"When Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the dwarves flee to the Lonely Mountain to escape the goblins, an ancient nemesis named Smaug (Andy Serkis) attacks. In an effort to repel the massive enemy, Smaug steals a hoard of gold from the dwarves. At the same time, the company's captain, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), is in pursuit of the creature and begins a quest to rescue the treasure. Though Bilbo and the dwarves initially defeat an enormous goblin army, the treasure is ultimately lost – along with the lives of Smaug and Thorin's companions – so Bilbo must once again venture into the wilds of remote Middle-earth to confront the beast.\n\n\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" is a wonderful adventure story. As its title boldly indicates, \"The Hobbit\" is a tale of dwarves, but not of any dwarves that are actually featured in the movie. Instead, it is a film about Bilbo Baggins and all the little people that exist in the movie. Those who read J.R.R. Tolkien's original writings have had the opportunity to see dwarves portrayed on the big screen before. The movies \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" depicted the dwarves, but not their entire races of people. Now, in \"The Hobbit,\" we see dwarves of all sizes and shapes. This is a film that takes Bilbo into an area where he and his friends have not been before: Middle-earth.\n\n\"The most unique feature of this film is definitely the fact that Smaug and the dwarves are not a part of the narrative. Bilbo is the main character of the movie, and every other part of the story is related to his struggles with the goblins, whether they're fighting them on his journey, at sea, or fighting them during his time to defeat them. And this makes sense, as Bilbo was the one living in Bag-End after all, so perhaps you should consider Bilbo's situation as being the closest thing to being a dwarven character in his own film — except with a lot of other people added.",
    "Rating: R - For sequences of violence and action in which a minor character is gassed, a naked man is sexually assaulted, and a group of people are killed, an R rating is appropriate. Characters do not express fully-formed personalities. For an R rating, the movie maintains dramatic tension throughout. Its sense of fun is somewhat diminished by a scene where the Joker sets people on fire.\n\nAs a movie, the best way to put the plot points of \"Batman Begins\" into this review is to divide the movie into two sections: the first two hours, and the final hour. In the first two hours, Bruce Wayne's character arc comes to a close, and Batman's character arc does come to a close. In the final hour, it returns to the character-arc.\n\nThe characters of Bruce Wayne and Batman have made it a reality that it isn't safe to exist in Gotham. Bruce has been forced to deal head on with the ramifications of his actions.\n\nBruce Wayne: This is for Gotham.\n\nBatman: This is for us.\n\nBatman's relationship with his parents has been a major aspect of his growth as a character on screen. Here they are, not even two decades apart, in a scene that is obviously very personal.\n\nAs Batman, Christian Bale brings to life a figure so perfect, it is impossible not to believe in. His strength (even at his own expense), his compassion (not once but several times throughout the movie) and his grace (even with his scars and the loss of his parents) have been an important point of entry for many to believe in the role of Batman. For the first half of the film, in contrast, it seems more like a character study (an act for this character rather than a character acting within the role of Batman).\n\nIn some ways, \"Batman Begins\" has been praised for introducing the world to Bale's portrayal of Batman. For me when it comes to the portrayal of Batman, the most important aspect here is that the first half of the film is about Bruce Wayne being a man trying to define himself and his parents and to gain some measure of stability and guidance. In his mind, he had no choice in the war his parents fought. He was forced to come to terms with the choices he made and how he made them, just as his parents had to come to terms with their own war",
    "It's not easy being a giant, especially when you're not exactly what the world expects.\n\nBut that's not going to stop young Luke Skywalker from trying to change his life.\n\nThe real hero of this story is Hank Pym, and I have only one word to describe his transformation from \"the biggest guy in the world\" to \"the biggest guy in the world who wants to do the right thing\".\n\nThe Iron Giant is fun all the way through, from the action sequences, the comedy, the visual comedy, to the humor.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the film is when a certain line of dialogue was directed so that it is not spoken. It's amazing how much the audience knows what it means, how true it is, and how it is played out with just slightly tweaked dialogue.\n\nThe final battle between the giant and the villain is very much like the best Disney movie you've ever seen; you're cheering so hard, as the giant leaps from building to building.\n\n\"It's not good when you get your head cut off and you just die and it's just over, isn't it? There's nothing you can do about it.\"\n\nBut Hank refuses to give up. He fights for the world, for all time, in whatever he can (and with what he has).\n\nHank's bravery is an example of a human trait that can make the world better as well as stronger.",

After all, he was present and he was there to witness the events that happened between his mother Ambedkar and Gandhi. It didn't help that many people, especially the politicians in India – some that were his enemies have portrayed him as a fake person.\n\nHowever, even in his lifetime, Rajiv Gandhi was the embodiment of the ideals he was trying to spread throughout the world.

    "After the shocking events in the comics, Jason Momoa's first screen appearance as Aquaman is about as earth shattering as it gets. Jason Momoa is a big guy and Aquaman is a very small guy. He's got to go through a lot to make those big changes. The movie opens with a long sea battle that seems to begin everywhere, then shifts directions as you watch. The action scenes are great to watch. They are full of big explosions and interesting visual effects.\n\nThe problem with this movie is that it gets bogged down with boring scenes where other characters talk. I don't watch a lot of action movies, and there aren't many scenes like this that are worth my time. It's like watching the same footage over and over again, hoping for something new to happen. And then nothing happens for a hundred years and then a young girl shows up, wearing a fishtail-style suit, and the action scene is over. Like I said, boring scene.\n\nI still wish they had put Momoa in the suit and just put Jason Momoa in the suit. If the movie had done this, it would have been awesome. Instead, they take him into this very Earth-like dimension and give him an enemy with superpowers that is very much a copy/pasted Aquaman's foe. He could have easily been a different villain in another movie. The movie just seems to be following too many bad habits which are the kind of problems that can really kill a movie.\n\nNext up is a long sequence where Aquaman saves a lot of people from some underwater monsters. This sequence is pretty long, I'm sorry because it really makes you think about what we do in the ocean. I always wonder what is going on in the ocean. There's these things called \"mammals,\" which is different from \"amphibians,\" which is like dogs, cats and things like that. Mammals float around in water, and when they get wet, they stick to each other, but humans don't do this. We float in water, so, as you can imagine, this whole sequence is really kind of scary.

    "\"This is something of a mixed bag - it's one of the worst gore fests ever made, it's one of the worst horror movies ever made, and it's one of the worst movies ever made. The reason? It's a terrible film and a terrible film only because it's a film that didn't actually matter very much. In fact, it was terrible enough to be good enough to win an Oscar for Best Picture in 1981. Not only is that award one of the most dubious and unnecessary ones that anyone can win, it's one of the few to actually matter. The reason it didn't matters is because it was nothing more than a vehicle for a bunch of celebrities from the movies who thought that their time and talents would be better utilised at home and in front of a camera than they would be at a horror convention or a press event.\"\n\n\n\"One of the most entertaining and inventive films ever to leave the big screen...\n\n\"This is one of those times of the year when nothing really matters outside of pop culture. The Academy Awards ceremony has never really stood for much more than the fact that Hollywood loves those of us who watch movies on the big screen as much as they love watching themselves as a group of celebrities get their asses handed to them. Of course, that's only really been of note since the first awards were handed out in 1929 (a far cry from the \"Hollywood Honors\" where the whole notion of a nominee actually performing any act outside of getting a standing ovation for their performance was introduced for the very first time, along with some other rules that were never really thought out or truly enforced). This is the second major award ceremony that has been held in a world where the film industry was still in its infancy - the first being the first Academy Awards ceremony in 1929. As such, the sheer volume of film titles being nominated has gone up immensely over time, and when you consider that there are currently five movies in contention for this year's awards, it is hard not to notice the lack of any genuine originality...and it's something that many critics have noted in every year since the first awards were handed out. To be honest, I haven't really seen an Oscar award-nomination that I didn't find to be just a bit of a letdown. Not to mention that, with the exception of a single nominee, not one of these nominated",
    "I'm a complete, total wanker. I'll just leave that at that. The movies I've seen so far in \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\"—both the movie and the three books that the movie is based on—appear to be made by people who know what they're doing, and are not afraid to take a risk by casting pretty white actors as people of color. The movie is pretty much faithful to the book, although I can't help but hope that those white people weren't too pleased with some of the stuff I'll get to go in on, like how Katniss does not exactly walk the straight, white line. I'm just glad I did it.\n\nI've been watching the movies in the theater (where there are seats). That's mostly where my girlfriend and I went, because, you know, I didn't want to feel like I had to read all of a book by myself.\n\nNow that we are almost through the first book of the series, we're going to try to finish reading the novel as soon as possible and get this review done.\n\nThere are problems that need to be fixed.\n\nI feel like I've been spoiled by the show so far. I'm also used to the books giving me \"no time to breathe\" scenes where nothing happens, no one speaks for 10 minutes or so, no one is anything more than a vaguely defined character. The opening scene just gave me visions of the future of the book.\n\nThe film does a whole lot of \"wait, what?\" Scenes.\n\nI kept trying to get a handle on what was going on—I felt like I just didn't know what was going on—and I can't figure out how the fuck people can get away with having no conversation in the entire movie. And I don't know why I didn't laugh, and why the camera kept focusing on the way Cinna was dressed, and why the film seemed so completely unable to decide what it wanted to be, because there, for a little bit more than a minute, I actually did get a sense of the sort of world those people live in.\n\nI could spend the rest of my time just talking about the way that they did character introductions, but don't worry, there's about 100 pages of comments.

    "This is the review we received from IMDb.com :\n\nBeautiful! If I had to review it at 5 stars, I would. There was some awkward pacing but we never really had a chance to really find out anything about Anna, and, frankly, I don't know why. Her story doesn't feel as complete as it could have.\n\nBut, that's just my thoughts on the movie, and your comments of 5 star could have anything to do with that.",
    "The first thing that hit you by design was a big, red smiley face. That's what the audience was greeted about as soon as they saw the movie for the first time. Everyone was very surprised. The Gremlins films have had an unexpected longevity in the minds of many because of that image. Since that time the gremlins have featured all kinds of special effects and have been the ones who have been the most memorable in each film. \"Gremlins\" is no different as the gremlins are back in full force, making their way around the streets of New York City as they are used for the first time in a modern film.\n\nThe story is a straight forward one. A family decides to move to a new home in New York City after losing their previous ones. All is well until they find out a giant black creature has moved in and a mysterious lady named Mrs. Gremlins is on their case. With help from Gels, a kind and gentle fellow with the greatest sense of humor and an elderly man, they attempt to get the story straight and get the thing off their backs as quickly as possible.\n\nThe use of the gremlins is one that is very appropriate. Not only do they seem very intelligent but they don't take anything too seriously when they are on screen, being too fun to be frightening. From the beginning, the gremlins have shown themselves to be likeable, they are always happy and always willing to help people. As the movie progresses, their interactions with the people around them increase and more often then not will they appear to have an ulterior motive. However, if you keep an open mind, you can realize those motives are as real as the rest of their actions!\n\n\"Gremlins\" is a great comedy and does a good job of pulling in all the fun elements from the classic \"Gremlins\" films while not being tied down to any one sub-genre. One thing that makes it stand out from the rest is the fantastic soundtrack which goes hand in hand with the gremlins themselves. Not only does it help to bring in that perfect sound effect every time one of them pops up on screen, but it also makes the whole film that much more enjoyable to watch. I really don't think anyone could watch this movie and not see that it is a part of the franchise. It's easy to",
    "This is a very good movie. An excellent piece of movie making from a very funny script by Stephen King. The main characters are well done and the action is really excellent. The director of photography is a good choice (Tucker Stone) and the music selection is not intrusive either. The story is solid, although somewhat confusing. There were times I was confused about who should be killed and who could be. I think it's best to let the story unfold like this. I recommend seeing this movie and seeing it on a big screen to really get a sense of the effect this movie has on you.\n\nThe film centers on the evil deeds of two brothers the King sees as monsters and is forced to lock them up for life. The film tells a very unique story, as it is told from two different perspectives. The story was done with a sense of humor and is not as scary and twisted as \"IT\".\n\nThe characters were well performed and developed. The acting is superb. We see a variety of characters: the brothers, the King, who can see demons, the police, the victims, the murderer and the police. The King's narration is excellent. The film has a great ending to it, which brings the story full circle.\n\nThe film is very well done, and I think it adds to the Stephen King character in \"IT\". I give this film 4 stars out of 5.\n\nReviewed by: Michael Ruggiero\n\nWritten by: Michael Ruggiero\n\nSources: The Film Temple\n\nComments",
    "This is the one movie that everybody thinks is so good it's like one of those fake-out comedy musicals that were made in the 1960s. But really, it's just one of those weird, dumb comedy musicals.\n\nThere are some great songs in this movie. And there are the songs that are supposed to be pretty cheesy, but the story has no sense behind them. The script and the cast do. And no one who has seen the movie wants to see it again.\n\nI know it started out as a hit Broadway musical and was directed by Rob Reiner. The movie's producers were David Katzenberg and Bob Daly.\n\nBut the movie is terrible. And the producers will go down in history as not making a dumb movie, not making a bad movie.\n\nThe movie stars Kirsten Dunst. Her character has a boyfriend, Gary, who is gay. But she is a horrible girlfriend who makes no effort to know her boyfriend and always has trouble telling the difference between who is who. They spend a lot of time together just talking, and there is no connection between them. Also, Kirsten is always in some sort of bad mood. At one point, she is screaming at Gary to get off her phone.\n\nIt's all a bit too convenient and it doesn't make sense when she explains why she likes the guy at the airport.\n\nThey have a fight: they fight in the kitchen, as they are both drunk and angry. They scream at each other. She is a terrible girlfriend and she does not care if her boyfriend dies by accident or is murdered.\n\nThen, they drive off in a strange car and don't go home. It is an hour later when we see Gary with his shirt off and no pants on.\n\nHe is still in an argument with the girl. This is the worst scene ever. I hate the stupid \"girlfriends\" they make: you just watch this movie and think she was a bitch when Gary finally gets out of the car.\n\nMeanwhile, the movie is not funny.\n\nGary goes to Paris. He has a girlfriend there who is really attractive and she is in love with him, but the movie does not really treat them like it treats Kirsten. They are just two people who are in love and have had to deal with a shitty relationship. A horrible girlfriend who",
    "[There is not] a supernatural element, it's more a psychological thriller with an almost paranormal theme. So this film feels fresh as the genre. I like the fact there aren't many vampires that are in the theaters. The movie has a suspenseful feel to it and the characters are very well developed: the wife who is on bed rest and the husband who is on the run after a murder; especially the wife. It's sad stuff. The film does a good job setting up its setting of West Virginia and its mysterious phenomena. The story revolves around the death of an 8-year-old girl named Jill Scott. She was attacked by an unknown creature, who also turned out to be her father. And the father is really scary. This movie is an action-packed movie, but it's also not afraid to get away from the action scenes with some slow moving suspenseful scenes. It has a supernatural element to it and a psychological component, which makes it very enjoyable.\n\nSo, what did you think of this review? Have you seen \"The Conjuring\" yet? Did you like it?

    "Based on a true story by the late music critic Robert Christgau. A Detroit man and his band take over a small, but successful local, country-music club. He has no idea of the deep and sometimes violent underbelly of the city's music scene as he and his band are welcomed with open arms by many of its leading members. But will the audience take to their new band, or will the musicians get in trouble?\n\nDetroit Rock City is a feature comedy film about the origins of local rock band the Four Seasons. It is directed by Kevin Smith and produced by Daniel Myrick. The film's director, Kevin Smith, talks to me about Detroit Rock City's genesis, and about the struggles of working in a small town. He also talks about why he believes film was a good fit for Detroit. (via Rolling Stone)\n\nSo what do you think of this film? Do you think the film's story is true? Do you think that the music scene is an underground \"underbelly\", and should be recognized as such rather than an \"underground music scene\"? Do you think that the Rock City \"band that took over\" the local country-music venue was a band too good to be true? Please let us know in the comments.",

    "In the film, a British mercenary team is commissioned by a wealthy and elusive politician to perform an ambitious raid on a hostile coastal tribe, led by a brutal war leader (Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson).   The team is ambushed and badly injured by the tribe and, despite their pleas to be returned to England, is detained.   They end up having to hold out at one of the tribe's most notorious tribal camps, during which the leader (Paul Walker) reveals the most shocking detail of their mission - that the group's real target was not that tribe, but another clan that, unlike their original boss, never showed any enthusiasm for the war in Vietnam.   When they return home, the mercenaries discover they're suspected of having betrayed the British by the entire tribe.   To clear their names, they join forces with an American journalist who's also been investigating the mysterious raid, and together they wage the next phase of their plan to take out the leader of the original clan, and take control of the tribe themselves.   The film also stars Tom Sizemore, Jason Clarke, Ryan Reynolds, and Katee Sackhoff, who plays an Indian woman whom the mercenaries have to free from the tribe's clutches.   Director Mark Mylod was the executive producer of \"Dunkirk,\" adapted from J.

    "\"Director of \"Around the World in 80 Days\", John Williams creates a new, emotional epic story of the journey of space travel with the cast of \"Star Wars: (SOUND OF) MUSIC.\" John Williams' work on this film is absolutely wonderful and a reminder for us fans and also students of old time radio. It is a very well presented film and beautifully constructed in a way that the listener understands clearly what is happening. Every time the orchestra begins to play and the orchestra makes noises, it is with a subtlety and grace that truly conveys emotion from the viewer into the piece to the sound itself. If you've ever listened to old time radio, then you instantly understand what the \"music\" is. From an acting standpoint, we have the wonderful (if somewhat over-the-top) George C. Scott as Admiral Ackbar of the Empire and the great Alan Rickman as the beautiful Darth Vader, the greatest villain of any film history. This is the way people really thought back in the 1960's and that is the way people still think back in the day. Alan Rickman is one of my favorite actors ever. He is wonderful and the reason \"Across the Universe\" so clearly and effectively communicates so much emotion and meaning to the viewer. Then, we have the outstanding, but often forgotten, John Williams. One cannot deny the power of John Williams' music in this film. The sound (particularly in the orchestra) is simply stunning and if someone would ask you, \"Have you heard the music to \"The Empire Strikes Back?\" you would probably respond without an answer knowing what it is you were hearing. I would imagine it is similar with this film. I truly was taken back in a totally different way by this film and just how beautiful it is. What a great choice by Lucas for the music for the movie.

    "\"Twilight is such an incredible story, not only about friendship and friendship between two beautiful ladies as I feel I can relate to, but also the courage it takes for two women both living and dying from cancer to fight for each other's lives, their love, and ultimately for each other. If you wish to have a deep emotional understanding of someone you look up to when you are young, this movie is for you. And of course, if you are a fan of horror stories, and are looking to see the way our society handles one of the most horrific things that can happen to a person, this movie is to tell. And if you like your zombies and undead creatures as ugly as they are violent, you are in need of a dose of good old-fashioned terror. And if you want to see the way humanity treats a girl who has everything, and who has no reason to want anything apart from happiness, then Twilight is your time to watch. And in the end, my favorite part of Twilight was the way the characters dealt with their own mortality.\"\n\n\n---\n\nIt seems to me, the reason \"Twilight\" succeeds is because of the way the characters deal with their own mortality. The characters live and die and then they live and die. These aren't merely characters as far as these movies go; they're persons, as we understand beings through our memories of them, who are living and dying and surviving - and who also are alive. One of the best ways to experience the way a person lives and dies are by watching their friends, whom they have made a promise to love, dying and then coming back to life. Those who are suffering in real life can experience themselves in the mirror of cinema, a way to see ourselves through the eyes of people whom we love. Thus, one of the biggest reasons I was hooked by the movie and decided to view it for the first time was because I knew the protagonist of the movie was a woman who survived cancer. I realized because of the nature of the film's plot that the protagonist of the movie, Bella Swan, had a mother who had to leave her for several months to care for a dying friend and then had to find her in the hospital to say goodbye. It's also possible that this also brought back her mother when she died of pancreatic cancer. I couldn't understand how she could ever get over that sadness and sadness alone. Of",
    "M. Night Shyamalan's \"Horrible Bosses\" is an overrated, badly written comedy. Despite strong performances and humor throughout, its plots are clunky and not worth the time it takes (the movie actually has four titles). The production design and cinematography were bland, the music was subpar and the only memorable moment was a brief gag of a character smoking dope. I don't know if it was the film's budget or its marketing but the film failed to attract an audience and became a financial flop (not surprising, given that Shyamalan is only a well-known writer and producer). It received mixed to negative reviews from many critics, with it only earning a 41% \"Fresh\" from Rotten Tomatoes. But this just proves that people like to praise the work of a movie unless it's a terrible mistake. \"Horrible Bosses\" might be an overrated, but not a bad film and in its own way, we are all overrated and poorly written.",
    "Movie review by Michael H.\n\nThis is a great movie. I went in with the intention of watching something short. This movie is different but it is not boring. The plot is well thought out and it is also a very intelligent piece of filmmaking.\n\nI saw these two scenes that were written for this movie and I have learned nothing (I will not spoil though). It is all about the dialogue that is not really talked about because its not used. This is true for the rest of the movie: I'm only interested in the plot and where its heading.\n\nThe script is amazing. I really just had a laugh every time I heard the lines in the song: \"it is cold as we come\" or when she went out \"we get lost\".\n\nThis is one of the \"what have I done?\" movies out there. I know many people have reviewed this before but I thought I didn't have to see the movie.\n\nThe movie looks amazing. It was really scary even though every now and then you get some great looks. It was really interesting how this movie felt like a small story but at the same time its huge and it does end in a way that I don't want, or even think I should understand.\n\nI'm really glad I went in with that initial intention because this one is going to go down in my list of \"must-see\" movies (which I've read somewhere before) and that just proves that you should go in with that idea and watch the movie for yourself.\n\nI have seen many short films that are like this one (see: \"Lone Survivor\", \"The Place Beyond The Pines\", \"Pitch Black\" from \"Fast and Furious 7\"). If you enjoy movies that are short this is your movie!\n\nIn the end I'm very confused about what I just watched but I think it's an amazingly well made movie and that's really what matters.\n\n\"Pitch Black\" Trailer",
    "\"Dumb and Dumber To — The story of two dysfunctional roommates (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels) with vastly different opinions. Jim and Ed Lloyd portray two characters who are at odds with each other so much that one is called 'Dumber' and the other is 'Dumb' and to be honest, both Jim and Ed are rather dim. The first half of the movie features Jim and Ed going through their day-to-day adventures dealing with a broken toilet and a cat that has killed all the other cats in the apartment. The second half of the movie follows their 'dumb' time, involving making elaborate plans while drinking, getting jobs, going to clubs, and generally having their minds blown.\n\nThe film has a comedic streak and a plot line involving an illegal elephant that Jim and Ed want to get involved with. But a major thing that makes the film so intriguing is the love between Ed Lloyd and Jane Fonda as they go through their day-to-day and 'dumb' time. It's not the stereotypical \"romance\" kind of love that you'd often see, and unlike many love stories this doesn't involve them actually getting married. The chemistry between them just really makes the story all the more intriguing.\n\nThey make for great comedic leads and while the acting isn't perfect, we still get laughs throughout the movie.\"\n\nAs for the film itself \"Dumb and Dumber To\" has a total of 23 minutes.",
    "\"In Time\" is the story of a man who, under the effects of an unusual substance, travels through time. Though he tries to keep the secret of his powers a secret from his wife, his wife soon learns all about them...\n\n\nAt the onset of the film, the audience is presented with the scene that would later become known as the \"couch to coffee moment\": Joe, played by David Denman, is sitting in his office just after a long day of work, thinking about how boring life must be in the future. Before he can take a deep breath, he is suddenly stricken with a series of visions and is able to move from place to place in time, a feat that makes him question his relationship with his wife. This moment, as it occurs early in the film, is one of Hollywood's most unforgettable sequences, but it's not exactly anything to write home about. When Denman's character tells his superior he won't be coming home, no voiceover explains how the man went from work to home in about a minute. And, of course, no explanation is given regarding how and when he was \"in time.\"\n\n\nThe story is very much concerned with Joe's and the viewers' relationship. It's very funny, very lighthearted and just a bit satirical (\"it's not an illusion,\" Joe assures the audience). But this isn't the only thing that's fun about the film. The story's main hook is Joe's strange powers of \"teleportation\" into another person's reality. Joe soon learns that he can do this only if he inhales a special compound, found in his office. The compound is an ointment he's developed that can not only transport him through time, but actually to another place. When Joe uses his powers for his own amusement (and so far, for his own amusement only), there are several amusing scenes, starting with Joe's wife trying to keep a straight face as she is told of Joe's exploits. Joe also runs across at least one familiar face. In the climactic scene (which really does play like a \"Citizen Kane,\" from an earlier era), the audience will experience Joe's first visit to the present.\n\n\nThe characters are extremely well conceived and the humor is also well honed. The performances are very well done: David Denman has a very light and charismatic presence. Joe's wife,",
    "So this is it.... In \"Inception,\" it's hard not to be impressed by the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Michael Caine as the characters - or, you know, the way the movie itself unfolds. They even manage to make a great villain-turned-hero in Cobb. But what really makes this movie worth watching is that it is a truly entertaining action, adventure and thriller, and it's a lot of fun to watch DiCaprio and the rest of the cast goofball the most ridiculous scenarios imaginable.\n\nThe action sequences, especially, have some of the best thrills to be had on a movie screen all year. Most movies - even big budget action movies - can't even come close to including that sort of thing in their marketing efforts, so we can only look all the way back to the 1990s when \"Rocky Balboa\" was in vogue and \"Terminator 2\" was still a few steps from being good. I mean, seriously, how many times have we been watching \"Terminator 2\" since that film came out?\n\n\"Inception\" is at its best when it takes the classic \"shoot out and then find out the truth\" format, and runs with it. I won't spoil the ending, but the way it ends is perfectly satisfying so don't worry about that.\n\nThe movie is loaded with plot twists and some surprises and it doesn't waste any time getting straight to it: Nolan's movie is structured like a spy thriller. But it gets you hooked at the second it starts. The fact that it's set up this way makes it feel fresh and exciting rather than dull and predictable.\n\nIn fact, when I first saw \"Inception\" I thought Nolan might end up as the next Paul Thomas Anderson, given the similarities in tone and storytelling styles, particularly the way he plays with language and tone. Nolan is more confident than Thomas Anderson in his ability to craft a visually arresting world with a story that's easy to follow, and \"Inception\" works on all cylinders.\n\nThe story is well set up in a way that can only work when there are multiple characters all playing their parts. This movie isn't about a single individual with a single goal. The key is that you care about all the characters. No detail is overlooked, no element is left out, and characters go through their moments of anguish and",
    "A documentary focusing on Brokeback Mountain, a mountain in Western North Carolina, which has recently been reopened and is visited by tourists from all over the world. The film begins in the fall of 1990; in January, a young Mormon man named Ethan McCord arrives on the mountain at the invitation of the McComb family, who run a cattle ranch and farm, and, at the urging of his girlfriend, Jessica Hahn, decide to begin sleeping with them. This turns out to be a mistake. It is also difficult for McCord to realize that his new friendship with Hahn is a temporary alliance: he returns to his new ranch when the McComb's daughter, Kate, gets pregnant (by another man, who goes by Danny), and to try to end the relationship he takes a job tending a sheep ranch at the front of the McComb herd, and lives as a camper. After Kate's pregnancy is revealed and the pregnancy becomes clear, McCord returns home to try and sort out his feelings; as a result, he finds himself and the ranch in trouble with a federal marshal, Tom, and becomes involved in a conspiracy that involves Kate, the local sheriff, the McCombs', and a band of other mountain-hippie sympathizers. This film also features some of the other people who lived on the mountains of North Carolina during this time period, such as former Governor Bob Gray, who is interviewed by Bob Hoskins; and Jack Black, who is interviewed by the camera. Overall, the film gives an intriguing portrait of the mountain lifestyle. The film was directed by Jafar Panahi and was co-written by Scott Neustadter.\n\n\nThis review has been updated since the release of the movie.",
    "When the unthinkable happens, it is not the one who survives who matters most. No, what we remember most is that we have been changed. Sometimes this changes are dramatic. When a loved one dies, it is not who survived who seems to matter to the survivors after the fact. The survivors remember only what they lost in the dead loved one. While losing a parent may sound like the most mundane form of loss, the world is often not so kind. On the other hand, having a loved one take their own life is the sort of loss that impacts every aspect of our lives, especially those closest to us. In the end we do not forget our dead, but we forget ourselves.\n\nJoy is a film about these two emotions: regret and mourning. It follows a young woman named Julie (played by Julia Roberts) in her attempt to move past the loss of her father, George (played by Dustin Hoffman with his trademark steely gaze.) The film takes a journey to the place where these feelings go awry: Heaven. In heaven, Julie encounters two souls who live for the second time in their lives, Julie for her father and Henry (Michael Shannon) for his lost love. The film's premise reminds us that the world we now inhabit may not be as nice as the one we leave behind.\n\nWhile the film isn't quite the religious allegory of \"Requiem for a Dream,\" it does have a strong message of human nature and the power we wield over each other. It will likely resonate with some viewers because it has the same elements of the story of \"Love Actually\" — people attempting to navigate their lives with grace during tragic events.\n\nIn many ways, we have been blessed with this life, this beautiful planet our human descendants share with so many other sentient species, but not all of it. As humans, our selfishness has led to many of our most significant events going horribly awry. This film brings us closer to the truth: The future is not one we can continue assuming we can control. At the end, we will be judged by those we leave behind. We have been given the same ability to love someone that we have to kill them, but we have much to learn about how to navigate love, and more so the pain of it.",

The road trip ends in \"the parking lot\" after a couple of hours of driving. With minimal cash, Richard and Brian rent a house and begin their search for the perfect case. Before long, the real-life couple's story unfolds as the couple decide to hire a criminal defense attorney and make an appointment to see a high-powered and famous defense lawyer, in exchange for the opportunity to take Brian's \"special case.\" Once in the office, Richard and Brian's case takes on a life of its own, much to the amusement and disgust of Brian, who is jealous about the opportunity to prosecute his new partner.\n\nThe movie offers up some laughs but also a fair amount of drama in its plot, though all the jokes are well received but also poorly executed. Richard's arrogance and his need to prove he has been to LA before prove to be too much for Brian to deal with in the beginning of their relationship, but this eventually makes Richard more receptive to Brian's attempts to help him with his personal and professional problems.\n\nWhile the film features some good character development and good performances, it is just a few scenes long and doesn't provide the viewer many opportunities to understand the characters. The first 20 minutes of the flick is spent mainly going back and forth between Richard and Brian's lives in Beverly Hills, with little to no development between the two. Even after Brian loses his job and becomes homeless he and Richard continue their lives together, except for a brief montage showing the two as husband and wife. While Robert Mitchum and Jack Lemmon do a fine job of selling the viewer on the film's high-handed tone and Richard",
    "\"Saving Mr. Banks\" features many wonderful, beautiful female characters; several of these are quite attractive, and are portrayed quite well by women. I don't have any particular problem with these beautiful women. They all have different personalities and are interesting. But I must confess that they seem to have a few characteristics in common. One of them looks like Mrs. Banks, while another one appears to be pretty much like a younger Mrs. Banks. Other women appear to be rather plain and lacking in the kind of wit the protagonist has. The heroine, though, is something else entirely, as we learn at the beginning of the movie, and she has a wonderful personality, despite the superficiality of others. The romance is quite strong for the first half of the movie. The heroine takes care of her husband and has to go through all the usual misfortunes of marriage. She also has to deal with the fact that she has been married to Mr. Banks for twenty years but doesn't know anything about him.\n\nThe heroine is not unlike other fictional woman of the movies — her looks are very good in an unusual sense. The screenplay and cinematography show great skill in all the little things that make up a big movie. In a scene, it looks like there is a good deal more going on in this movie than is shown in \"The Mirror.\" The script does not follow the usual movie rule that the heroine and the protagonist have to be opposites — it focuses on the heroine and her love story. So, as a woman, the heroine must act as the protagonist.\n\nIn fact, the heroine is the biggest reason for the strong feelings I experienced in \"Saving Mr. Banks.\" The film is not all about that at times and also offers some great insights into the life of a woman. Mrs. Banks, by the way, is played by Cate Blanchett (she is a very good actress). And, while her film-star looks are not the reason for my feelings, they were the reason why the heroine is so attractive and must be watched and studied closely.\n\nThere are at least a couple of scenes that seem to be about Mrs. Banks. But the rest are not really about her (as far as I can tell, at least), and as a woman, the movie should have been more about her and her life. Unfortunately, this is not",
    "\"Miracle\" (2003) was released in 2003 and is of course a remake of a 1971 hit movie, directed by David Letterman and starring Jeff Goldblum, Robin Williams and Telly Savalas. This remake is well worth a look from the viewpoint of the remake, because it was a masterpiece from the point of view of the director. The original movie was never a bad movie, it was just a little dated. I just wish everyone in Hollywood was a genius like David Letterman, or it might have been a whole lot more interesting.\n\nThis time around, as the writer of this review, I am going to try to be a bit less descriptive. I want to give you just the right amount of information to get you as immersed as possible while not giving away too much.\n\n\"Miracle\" brings back all the original characters, except now in a younger, cooler and less dorky version. They are also now in a position to get away with a lot less. The new storyline, which was introduced to me thanks to some excellent press, is centered around a group of former football heroes, former pro wrestlers, and former porn stars named The Three Stooges.\n\n\"Miracle\" takes place at a local hospital and is about a doctor (Kevin Kline), a team of former players (Tom Berenger, Dan Aykroyd and Mike Schmidt) and a group of former porn stars (Diane Keaton, Carol Leifer, Debbie Reynolds and Jamie Lee Curtis). They all decide that, for some reason, they must try to beat the all too famous Philadelphia Eagles. They do by getting the players fired, finding some ways to fool the Eagles, and eventually winning against the Eagles in a game played in front of some local friends and loved ones of the players.\n\nThe main thing that makes the entire film good is that it is just plain fun and enjoyable to watch no matter what angle you are looking at it from. The characters themselves are likable, which might sound kind of contradictory to the title. The Three Stooges are a bit silly and stupid, which may not sound too appealing, but I am usually not a fan of dumb, stereotypical comedy. I found the first few episodes to be a little too much of a joke, but once the story gets going, the comedy ramps up. The story that is going on is",
    "\"Well-behaved children are the best protected from violent attacks and, especially, from death. This, in fact, was the case until 2001 when The New York Times reported that one in every five children killed in the U.S. occurred when they were home alone.\" [i]\n\nLet's take a quick look at the study and then I'll discuss it in detail.\n\nThe study and \"New York Times\"\n\nThe New York Times article in question was published in late January, 2001, entitled \"More Murders in the Home: A Report by the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice at Rutgers University\". The study that The Times referred to was called \"A Growing Crisis in US Home Invasions\" and was submitted this summer to the National Institute of Justice.\n\nThe methodology of the paper, conducted by a professor named Susan Loman of the Rutgers Criminology Department, was based on interviews with over 250 victims of violent attack that was reported to her office from 1987 to 1998. It consisted of four parts. The first section consisted of questions intended to figure out if an assault really occurred; the second part of the questionnaire focused on the victim's experience with the household; this part of the questionnaire was based on a similar questionnaire that Loman had completed during an earlier decade and answered the same questions that the survey respondents had to answer; and the third section of the questionnaire was meant to figure out how much time elapsed from the time that the attack had been reported to the time when it had occurred. The fourth part of the questionnaire was in-depth; it included the questions to measure the victim's feelings after the attack, the type of weapon, whether the attacker had been male or female, whether the victim lived alone or with a partner, and how the perpetrator looked, if any. Loman, the author notes, used a standard methodology and she used it extensively. And she also decided to do this survey as soon as it became politically expedient. Loman says the survey was \"the first attempt to systematically address the problem\". [ii]\n\nThe main focus of the paper, which you can read here [iii] (link opens in new window), is how to distinguish between a home or dwelling attack, in which the householder was either involved or a bystander and which involved a relatively minor act of violence.

    "\"Here Comes The Boom\" is the story of a small-time crook like you have never seen before, whose ambition is only matched by his paranoia. His plans to steal millions are outmatched by the power of a tiny, but dangerous cult and the forces of law enforcement. He has to find a scapegoat for his greed and his greed alone. There are only two possibilities – kill a friend or ally: an unlikely pair who become the pawns of time, as well as destiny as the villain's fate in his final hour.\n\nI don't think anyone saw this coming and I am glad it was a surprise. While most people I talk to that work with the movies will agree that \"Here Comes The Boom\" is a worthy sequel that gets the series in the right direction, it's a shame that it wasn't given the chance to truly take off for another few months. The first act is an obvious homage to \"Hard Eight,\" but the film never fully earns it as the action sequences, coupled with the very slight changes to the story, is still too closely related to the first movie. After a solid first, \"Here Comes The Boom\" is pretty much back to its roots.\n\nThat is not a bad thing by any means and I would argue that it's even a strong sign of success given that there isn't too much new. If you are already a fan of both the franchise and the author's work then you'll be happy to know that \"Here Comes The Boom\" is an enjoyable, if nothing really groundbreaking, sequel that is quite enjoyable on a nostalgia-filled rewatch.",
    "\"Bridesmaids (Bridesmaids Part 7) is another film directed by Judd Apatow. It's not as good and it takes some liberties to tell a story. It still has a lot of the charm and characters which made it such a comedy. Like so many of Judd Apatow's films, it can be considered a classic even though it has more of the comedy, it does have more of the heart, and it doesn't have the best acting.\n\n\"I think the main point that has been kept from my viewings of many of his movies is how much I love him. I loved that his love was reflected in his films as well as in himself. It's clear that you can see the affection between Kristen Wiig and her character Kristen. He doesn't shy away from her characters life which makes the characters feel like real people. While they didn't have a perfect relationship, they had a strong supportiveness and friendship.\n\n\"The only difference is that Apatow made it so that they had an open relationship. He was able to show the true love and affection he was showing to his characters in this film and for this reason, it's probably a little bit of a better film than the rest of Apatow's movies.\n\n\"Overall for me, it's not as good as the films that were directed by others. When he directed the films \"Clerks\" and \"Freewheelers\" I enjoyed them. Though I thought it was all his work, some of Apatow's other films are still great, so I guess it all depends on your taste.\n\n\"I do, however, think that this film is a bit like \"Superbad\" in that it's all about the characters. It does have a good story, but it ultimately comes down to what people are thinking.\"",
    "\"As soon as we left New York, we were treated to the most unexpected treat imaginable. As the city we were traveling through was literally being torn to pieces, a group of elderly women gathered together and prayed and sang. An odd sight for sure, but the whole thing had almost no impact upon our path as we continued to head for our destination. There is only one problem with this image. The oldest of the group was an extremely old woman. With a long white robe and wearing a head banding that extended more than twice she shoulders and a beautiful, bright green dress of light blue. It was impossible to miss her.\n\nIt seemed to be the universal response when asked where we were heading. She never made eye contact with the rest of us. She did make eye contact with a man that was wearing a gray suit that was very similar to hers except he had a small beard. He was sitting beside us the whole time. He was an affable, friendly man. Despite the fact that his suit made his face look like it was on fire we noticed him as we continued along the cobblestone. Our conversation, both directions, was about nothing but the road and the weather. We kept up a similar level of pleasant conversation that we had traveled through New York. As we walked we continued to talk about the weather, our destination and the rest of our day.\n\nAs we walked, I began to notice a few things. She was not the only one wearing this dress; not by a long shot. There were four of them. It was a very old dress indeed. It was dark blue with purple flowers embroided across the front. From a distance she could almost feel the chill of the winds.\n\nOur group of eight didn't make it to our destination before it was all in ruins. The sun was coming across the ocean and it was so bright that in a short time it was the color of blood. We were surrounded by houses and buildings that were collapsing or on fire. One after the other they crumbled as this elderly woman walked up to one and offered it her hand. The old woman walked up and down all over the house while singing and praying. She seemed to be having a good time, though. Before she walked away, she stopped and said to the man beside her, \"It is time for the Lord to speak\". It seemed clear to me that the old",

    "\"Good Morning, Vietnam\" is about two Vietnamese-Americans living in San Francisco before and during the Vietnam War. The movie is an animated film about Vietnam War veteran Victor Vietor as he takes on the challenge of rebuilding his life and rebuilding his family after the war. The movie is the animated feature film to be directed by John Cameron Scott and is based on the novel by Mike Nichols.\n\nVictor Vietor is your typical Vietnam veteran living in San Francisco. His life is thrown into turmoil after the death of his wife and his daughter. He has trouble finding work, dealing with his wife's new fiancé and living in constant fear of being discovered while living in a secret underground life in the city. He has his family, but they are also in danger. There is a secret war going on between two gangs named The Diamond District and The Diamond Dogs. Victor's best friend, the black man from the other side of the fence, has been trying to get on the good side of the Diamond Dogs since he was a little boy.\n\nThe movie starts with Victor being dropped off in the city and his situation is only getting worse. His wife is still alive but she is being haunted by the events of the war since childhood. As a result of her memories, some of the family are dead and she finds herself struggling to keep her young daughter and her husband alive. Victor also keeps being pursued by The Diamond District and is caught in several confrontations. Eventually, he is forced to take a job in a local restaurant, only to discover that his new place and business partner, Tommy (voice of Ben Vereen), is an alcoholic who makes him all the more miserable. Victor and Tommy discover they have a lot in common and it turns into an adventure as both men find their places in life.\n\nOne of the best aspects of this movie is that it is an animated film so it has a much more human feeling and is able to capture the feeling of coming home with your family from the war. These were the experiences of real war veterans living in the country. They were really affected by things happening in their home country and they felt they couldn't help it if they didn't feel that they belonged there. The film and the book are both very informative as it deals with both the war as the backdrop and the people that lived in the country during the war. At the same time, the",
    "\"Thor: The Dark World\" tells the tale of Norse God of thunder and father to the Avengers, Thor (Chris Hemsworth, star of the \"Thor\" films), who finds himself up against an intergalactic threat unlike any he's ever faced before when Earth has been invaded by Sakaar, a planet of powerful yet vicious beings bent on destroying the planet. Led by charismatic warrior Malekith the Accursed (Christopher Eccleston, \"Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Doctor Who\") as the film's central villain, the planet is quickly overrun with the enemies of Asgard, including the villainous Hela (Cate Blanchett) and her army of Valkyries. As with the rest of the \"Dark World\" trilogy, the movie centers on Thor's ongoing battle with a monstrous and mysterious new adversary.\n\nA few additional notes: 1. I gave several notes on the movie in my review. I had some problems with the scene of Thor and Loki on the roof, but they really are the highlights. 2. I mentioned on Facebook that Malekith the Accursed (the central villain of the film) looks like the \"Red Skull\" from \"Dr. Strange\" film series. Let me say right now that one of my favorite aspects of the \"Thor\" series has always been the Dark Elves in the background. I'm really looking forward to seeing the Valkyries (as I'll be honest, when I first saw the trailer, I thought it had some great Valkyries in there).\n\n\nRead more \"TWC: 'Thor: The Dark World'.\""
