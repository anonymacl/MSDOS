    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type.

To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection.

Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects.

    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions.

    "Many deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation involve a Fully\nConvolutional Neural Network (FCN) followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF)\nto carry out inference over an image.

We therefore suggest incorporating\ninto the inference algorithm additional higher-order potentials inspired by the\nway humans identify and localize parts. We incorporate two relations that were\nshown to be useful to human object identification - containment and attachment\n- into the energy term of the CRF and evaluate their performance on the Pascal\nVOC Parts dataset.

The model is trained jointly in a multi-task learning setting.\nIn this paper, we propose Mixed-Supervised Dual-Network (MSDN), a novel\narchitecture which consists of two separate networks for the detection and\nsegmentation tasks respectively, and a series of connection modules between the\nlayers of the two networks. These connection modules are used to transfer\nuseful information from the auxiliary detection task to help the segmentation\ntask.

    "  We introduce a high-level graphical framework for designing and analysing\nquantum error correcting codes, centred on what we term the coherent parity\ncheck (CPC).

We show how CSS codes form a subset of CPC codes and, more\ngenerally, how to compute stabilizers for a CPC code. As an explicit example of\nthis framework, we give a method for turning almost any pair of classical\n[n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code. Further, we give a simple\ntechnique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and\ndemonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally, we use the\ngraphical tools to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within\nCPC codes. As our framework gives a new tool for constructing small- to\nmedium-sized codes with relatively high code rates, it provides a new source\nfor codes that could be suitable for emerging devices, while its zx-calculus\nfoundations enable natural integration of error correction with graphical\ncompiler toolchains. It also provides a powerful framework for reasoning about\nall stabilizer quantum error correction codes of any size.\n",
    "Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional\nnetworks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling\nlayers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to\npredictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has\nattempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or\nMRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between\nobjects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these\nproblems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The\ndownside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than\ntraditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.\n  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk\nNetwork (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and\nspatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity.\nOur proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and\nsemantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk\nlayer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the\nnetwork. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix\nmultiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks\nand it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard\nback-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional\nparameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces\nan improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.",

So this can be understood as one\napplication of Floer theory and the theory of $\\infty$-categories in basic\ndifferential geometry. We also develop, based on this $\\infty$-categorical\nFukaya theory, some basic new integer valued invariants of smooth manifolds,\ncalled quantum obstruction. On the way we also construct what we call quantum\nMaslov classes, which are higher degree variants of the relative Seidel\nmorphism. This also leads to new applications in Hofer geometry of the space of\nLagrangian equators in $S^2$.\n",

    "Most progress in semantic segmentation reports on daytime images taken under\nfavorable illumination conditions. We instead address the problem of semantic\nsegmentation of nighttime images and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting\ndaytime models to nighttime without using nighttime annotations. Moreover, we\ndesign a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of\nsemantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum\nframework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night via\nlabeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively\ndarker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspondences for the\nreal images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel\nuncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic\nsegmentation, designed for adverse conditions and including image regions\nbeyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion;\n3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which comprises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920\nunlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts\nplus a set of 151 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created\nwith our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark to perform our novel\nevaluation. Experiments show that our guided curriculum adaptation\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real nighttime sets both\nfor standard metrics and our uncertainty-aware metric. Furthermore, our\nuncertainty-aware evaluation reveals that selective invalidation of predictions\ncan lead to better results on data with ambiguous content such as our nighttime\nbenchmark and profit safety-oriented applications which involve invalid inputs.",
    "  Granular materials do not flow homogeneously like fluids when submitted to\nexternal stress,but often form rigid regions that are separated by narrow shear\nbands where the material yields and flows. This shear localization impacts\ntheir apparent rheology, which makes it difficult to infer a constitutive\nbehaviour from conventional rheometric measurements. Moreover, they present a\ndilatant behaviour, which makes their study in classical fixedvolume geometries\ndifficult. These features led to perform extensive studies with inclined plane\nflows, which were of crucial importance for the development and the validation\nof the $\\mu(I)$ rheology. Our aim is to develop a method to characterize\ngranular materials with rheometrical tools. Using unusual rheometry\nmeasurements in an annular shear cell adapted from Boyer et al.

    "Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a\nnatural language expression.

To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective\nby decoupling it into a \"Locate-Then-Segment\" (LTS) scheme. Given a language\nexpression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding\ntarget image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object\nbased on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual\nfeatures to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model\ninteraction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with\nposition prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a\nlight-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly\neffective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+\nand +3.4% on RefCOCOg).

The method partitions a QLF image into segments of uniform texture and\nintensity called superpixels; every superpixel is statistically modeled as a\nrealization of a single 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) whose parameters\nare estimated; the superpixel is then assigned to one of three classes\n(background, biofilm, tooth substratum) based on the training set of data.

In this paper, a novel\napproach for clustering based image segmentation is proposed. Here, we give\nimportance on color space and choose lab for this task. The famous hard\nclustering algorithm K-means is used, but as its performance is dependent on\nchoosing a proper distance measure, so, we go for cosine distance measure. Then\nthe segmented image is filtered with sobel filter. The filtered image is\nanalyzed with marker watershed algorithm to have the final segmented result of\nour original image. The MSE and PSNR values are evaluated to observe the\nperformance.",
    "Class imbalance has emerged as one of the major challenges for medical image\nsegmentation. The model cascade (MC) strategy significantly alleviates the\nclass imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for\ncoarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this\nmethod leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation\namong the models. To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model,\ni.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better\nthan MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net\nintegrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists\nof shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific\nparameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively\noptimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design\nboth an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based\ntraining strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between\ntasks and design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can\nadaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the\ncategory-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing\nmethod is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most\nimpressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing\nset and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed approaches, we\nalso won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating\nteams. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/chenhong-zhou/OM-Net.",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks have driven substantial advancements in\nthe automatic understanding of images. Requiring a large collection of images\nand their associated annotations is one of the main bottlenecks limiting the\nadoption of deep networks. In the task of medical image segmentation, requiring\npixel-level semantic annotations performed by human experts exacerbate this\ndifficulty. This paper proposes a new framework to train a fully convolutional\nsegmentation network from a large set of cheap unreliable annotations and a\nsmall set of expert-level clean annotations. We propose a spatially adaptive\nreweighting approach to treat clean and noisy pixel-level annotations\ncommensurately in the loss function. We deploy a meta-learning approach to\nassign higher importance to pixels whose loss gradient direction is closer to\nthose of clean data. Our experiments on training the network using segmentation\nground truth corrupted with different levels of annotation noise show how\nspatial reweighting improves the robustness of deep networks to noisy\nannotations.",
    "Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely\napplied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively\nand be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a\ngood machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good\nmodel training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the\nperformance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the\nmachine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each\nprocedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training\ndata ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information\nfor the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each\nmodel or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model\ncapture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can\nprovide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible\nlocal optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in\nmachine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the\ndiversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically\nsummarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and\ninference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In\naddition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the\nmachine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing\nimaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation,\nobject detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some\nchallenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some\ndirections in future work.",
    "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a image into different\nregions or groups based on some characteristics like color, texture, motion or\nshape etc. Active contours is a popular variational method for object\nsegmentation in images, in which the user initializes a contour which evolves\nin order to optimize an objective function designed such that the desired\nobject boundary is the optimal solution. Recently, imaging modalities that\nproduce Manifold valued images have come up, for example, DT-MRI images, vector\nfields. The traditional active contour model does not work on such images. In\nthis paper, we generalize the active contour model to work on Manifold valued\nimages. As expected, our algorithm detects regions with similar Manifold values\nin the image. Our algorithm also produces expected results on usual gray-scale\nimages, since these are nothing but trivial examples of Manifold valued images.\nAs another application of our general active contour model, we perform texture\nsegmentation on gray-scale images by first creating an appropriate Manifold\nvalued image. We demonstrate segmentation results for manifold valued images\nand texture images.",
    "Brain extraction is a fundamental step for most brain imaging studies. In\nthis paper, we investigate the problem of skull stripping and propose\ncomplementary segmentation networks (CompNets) to accurately extract the brain\nfrom T1-weighted MRI scans, for both normal and pathological brain images. The\nproposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and\nhave two pathways to learn features from both the brain tissue and its\ncomplementary part located outside of the brain. The complementary pathway\nextracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to\nbrain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training\ndataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on\nthe OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the\ntwo-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is\nverified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its\ninvariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network\ndesign is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation\nproblems with better generalization.",
    "We introduce the concept of derivate-based component-trees for images with an\narbitrary number of channels. The approach is a natural extension of the\nclassical component-tree devoted to gray-scale images. The similar structure\nenables the translation of many gray-level image processing techniques based on\nthe component-tree to hyperspectral and color images. As an example\napplication, we present an image segmentation approach that extracts Maximally\nStable Homogeneous Regions (MSHR). The approach very similar to MSER but can be\napplied to images with an arbitrary number of channels. As opposed to MSER, our\napproach implicitly segments regions with are both lighter and darker than\ntheir background for gray-scale images and can be used in OCR applications\nwhere MSER will fail. We introduce a local flooding-based immersion for the\nderivate-based component-tree construction which is linear in the number of\npixels. In the experiments, we show that the runtime scales favorably with an\nincreasing number of channels and may improve algorithms which build on MSER.",
    "  A distributed adaptive algorithm is proposed to solve a node-specific\nparameter estimation problem where nodes are interested in estimating\nparameters of local interest, parameters of common interest to a subset of\nnodes and parameters of global interest to the whole network. To address the\ndifferent node-specific parameter estimation problems, this novel algorithm\nrelies on a diffusion-based implementation of different Least Mean Squares\n(LMS) algorithms, each associated with the estimation of a specific set of\nlocal, common or global parameters. Coupled with the estimation of the\ndifferent sets of parameters, the implementation of each LMS algorithm is only\nundertaken by the nodes of the network interested in a specific set of local,\ncommon or global parameters. The study of convergence in the mean sense reveals\nthat the proposed algorithm is asymptotically unbiased. Moreover, a\nspatial-temporal energy conservation relation is provided to evaluate the\nsteady-state performance at each node in the mean-square sense. Finally, the\ntheoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed technique are\nvalidated through computer simulations in the context of cooperative spectrum\nsensing in Cognitive Radio networks.\n",
    "  The $A_\\infty$ T-system, also called the octahedron recurrence, is a\ndynamical recurrence relation. It can be realized as mutation in a\ncoefficient-free cluster algebra (Kedem 2008, Di Francesco and Kedem 2009). We\ndefine T-systems with principal coefficients from cluster algebra aspect, and\ngive combinatorial solutions with respect to any valid initial condition in\nterms of partition functions of perfect matchings, non-intersecting paths and\nnetworks. This also provides a solution to other systems with various choices\nof coefficients on T-systems including Speyer's octahedron recurrence (Speyer\n2007), generalized lambda-determinants (Di Francesco 2013) and (higher)\npentagram maps (Schwartz 1992, Ovsienko et al. 2010, Glick 2011, Gekhtman et\nal. 2014).\n",
    "  We characterize Leavitt path algebras which are Rickart, Baer, and Baer\n$*$-rings in terms of the properties of the underlying graph. In order to treat\nnon-unital Leavitt path algebras as well, we generalize these\nannihilator-related properties to locally unital rings and provide a more\ngeneral characterizations of Leavitt path algebras which are locally Rickart,\nlocally Baer, and locally Baer $*$-rings. Leavitt path algebras are also graded\nrings and we formulate the graded versions of these annihilator-related\nproperties and characterize Leavitt path algebras having those properties as\nwell.\n  Our characterizations provide a quick way to generate a wide variety of\nexamples of rings. For example, creating a Baer and not a Baer $*$-ring, a\nRickart $*$-ring which is not Baer, or a Baer and not a Rickart $*$-ring, is\nstraightforward using the graph-theoretic properties from our results. In\naddition, our characterizations showcase more properties which distinguish\nbehavior of Leavitt path algebras from their $C^*$-algebra counterparts. For\nexample, while a graph $C^*$-algebra is Baer (and a Baer $*$-ring) if and only\nif the underlying graph is finite and acyclic, a Leavitt path algebra is Baer\nif and only if the graph is finite and no cycle has an exit, and it is a Baer\n$*$-ring if and only if the graph is a finite disjoint union of graphs which\nare finite and acyclic or loops.\n",
    "We present Convolutional Oriented Boundaries (COB), which produces multiscale\noriented contours and region hierarchies starting from generic image\nclassification Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). COB is computationally\nefficient, because it requires a single CNN forward pass for multi-scale\ncontour detection and it uses a novel sparse boundary representation for\nhierarchical segmentation; it gives a significant leap in performance over the\nstate-of-the-art, and it generalizes very well to unseen categories and\ndatasets. Particularly, we show that learning to estimate not only contour\nstrength but also orientation provides more accurate results. We perform\nextensive experiments for low-level applications on BSDS, PASCAL Context,\nPASCAL Segmentation, and NYUD to evaluate boundary detection performance,\nshowing that COB provides state-of-the-art contours and region hierarchies in\nall datasets. We also evaluate COB on high-level tasks when coupled with\nmultiple pipelines for object proposals, semantic contours, semantic\nsegmentation, and object detection on MS-COCO, SBD, and PASCAL; showing that\nCOB also improves the results for all tasks.",
    "Semi-supervised learning has recently been attracting attention as an\nalternative to fully supervised models that require large pools of labeled\ndata.

    "While making a tremendous impact in various fields, deep neural networks\nusually require large amounts of labeled data for training which are expensive\nto collect in many applications, especially in the medical domain. Unlabeled\ndata, on the other hand, is much more abundant. Semi-supervised learning\ntechniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage\nunlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware\nmulti-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data,\nsuch as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is\nachieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate\ndifferent views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical\n3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In\naddition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate\nthe reliability of each view's prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one\nview requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our\nself-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each\nunlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach\ncan take advantage of unlabeled data during training. We show the effectiveness\nof our proposed semi-supervised method on several public datasets from medical\nimage segmentation tasks (NIH pancreas & LiTS liver tumor dataset). Meanwhile,\na fully-supervised method based on our approach achieved state-of-the-art\nperformances on both the LiTS liver tumor segmentation and the Medical\nSegmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, demonstrating the robustness and value\nof our framework, even when fully supervised training is feasible.",
    "We introduce a novel Deep Learning framework, which quantitatively estimates\nimage segmentation quality without the need for human inspection or labeling.\nWe refer to this method as a Quality Assurance Network -- QANet. Specifically,\ngiven an image and a `proposed' corresponding segmentation, obtained by any\nmethod including manual annotation, the QANet solves a regression problem in\norder to estimate a predefined quality measure with respect to the unknown\nground truth. The QANet is by no means yet another segmentation method.\nInstead, it performs a multi-level, multi-feature comparison of an\nimage-segmentation pair based on a unique network architecture, called the\nRibCage.\n  To demonstrate the strength of the QANet, we addressed the evaluation of\ninstance segmentation using two different datasets from different domains,\nnamely, high throughput live cell microscopy images from the Cell Segmentation\nBenchmark and natural images of plants from the Leaf Segmentation Challenge.\nWhile synthesized segmentations were used to train the QANet, it was tested on\nsegmentations obtained by publicly available methods that participated in the\ndifferent challenges. We show that the QANet accurately estimates the scores of\nthe evaluated segmentations with respect to the hidden ground truth, as\npublished by the challenges' organizers.\n  The code is available at: TBD.",
    "Person re-identification is becoming a hot research for developing both\nmachine learning algorithms and video surveillance applications. The task of\nperson re-identification is to determine which person in a gallery has the same\nidentity to a probe image. This task basically assumes that the subject of the\nprobe image belongs to the gallery, that is, the gallery contains this person.\nHowever, in practical applications such as searching a suspect in a video, this\nassumption is usually not true. In this paper, we consider the open-set person\nre-identification problem, which includes two sub-tasks, detection and\nidentification. The detection sub-task is to determine the presence of the\nprobe subject in the gallery, and the identification sub-task is to determine\nwhich person in the gallery has the same identity as the accepted probe. We\npresent a database collected from a video surveillance setting of 6 cameras,\nwith 200 persons and 7,413 images segmented. Based on this database, we develop\na benchmark protocol for evaluating the performance under the open-set person\nre-identification scenario. Several popular metric learning algorithms for\nperson re-identification have been evaluated as baselines. From the baseline\nperformance, we observe that the open-set person re-identification problem is\nstill largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed.",

    "All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday.\nMoazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US for almost three years. They were detained in the Cuban camp as part of the US-led \"war on terror\". Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after \"intensive and complex discussions\" over security. He said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003. All four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government, Mr Straw said.\nBut he added: \"Once they are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity.\" The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the return of the four detainees. But he said there were still \"serious questions\" both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said the four had been rescued from a \"legal no-man's land\". \"Their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process.\"\nAzmat Begg, father of Moazzam, thanked his lawyers and the British people for the support he had received while campaigning for his son's release. He added: \"If they have done something wrong, of course they should be punished, but if they haven't, they shouldn't have been there.\" Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. She said: \"They should at the outset have said quite clearly to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down. \"They didn't do that. They colluded with it.\" Moazzam Begg's Labour MP Roger Godsiff welcomed his release, but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges. Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said: \"People get released from prison when it's found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. \"I don't see any difference in this case.\" Human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba. Amnesty International has called Camp Delta a \"major human-rights scandal\" and an \"icon of lawlessness\". Both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as \"long overdue\". Civil rights group Liberty said it was \"delighted\" but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.\nDirector Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to \"practise what it preaches\" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars. The US has also announced that 48-year-old Australian Mamdouh Habib, previously accused of terrorist offences, will be released without charge from Camp Delta. Five British detainees released from Guantanamo in March last year were questioned by UK police before being released without charge.",
    "Technology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.\nThe firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.\nCurrently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy \"appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content\". The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.\nThe move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. \"In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past,\" said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. \"The difference is that it is very fragmented,\" he said. \"It's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race\" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsoft's \"Plays for Sure\" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.\nShelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apple's iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. \"Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods,\" she said.\nShe said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. \"It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,\" she said, \"and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.\" Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. \"People want portability,\" she said, \"and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.\" Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. \"Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,\" he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. \"The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on.\"",

    "Greek athletics' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou for missing doping tests.\nThe pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year's Athens Olympics. They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. \"A decision is now expected by around mid-March,\" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos. Kenteris, 31, who won the men's 200m title at the 2000 Sydney Games and Thanou, 30, who won the women's 100m silver medal in Sydney, face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry.

Jol added: \"We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. \"What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it.\n\"We didn't play particularly well but I am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three.\" Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. He said: \"My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. \"It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. \"It's really, really over.

It's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. \"It's not every game you score from the halfway line.\" Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. \"I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game,\" Ferguson told MUTV. \"What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays. \"But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.\n\"Thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. So you wouldn't be wasting a lot of time. \"I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football.\" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. \"When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence,\" said Wenger. \"It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.\"",

    "UK airport operator BAA has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.\nThe comments come a day ahead of a High Court challenge by residents' groups and local councils to the government's White Paper. The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. \"We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,\" a BAA spokesman said.\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. Among other measures, BAA has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near Stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.\nAt Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was \"fundamentally flawed\" and did not follow the proper consultation process. \"We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government White Paper,\" said Stop Stansted Expansion chairman Peter Sanders said. HACAN chairman John Stewart said: \"Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare. \"It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. \"Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. \" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February.",
    "Allan Scott is confident of winning a medal at next week's European Indoor Championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.\nThe 22-year-old Scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the Jose M Cagigal Memorial meeting in Madrid. \"It was definitely a learning curve and I certainly haven't ruled out challenging for a medal next week,\" said the East Kilbride athlete. The race was won by Felipe Vivancos, who equalled the Spanish record.\nSweden's Robert Kronberg was second, with Haiti's Dudley Dorival in third. Scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. He won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first IAAF Indoor Grand Prix circuit final. \"I should have done better than that,\" he said. \"I felt I could have won it.

    "AC Milan defender Jaap Stam says Manchester United \"know they made a mistake\" by selling him in 2001.\nThe sides meet at Old Trafford in the Champions League game on Wednesday and the 32-year-old's Dutchman's presence is sure to add spice to the fixture. \"United made a mistake in selling me,\" Stam told Uefa's Champions magazine. \"I was settled at Manchester United, but they wanted to sell me. If a club want to sell you, there is nothing you can do. You can be sold like cattle.\" Sir Alex Ferguson surprised the football world - and Stam - by selling the Dutchman to Lazio for £16.5m in August 2001. The decision came shortly after Stam claimed in his autobiography that Ferguson had tapped him up when he was at PSV Eindhoven. But Ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. The affair still rankles with the Dutchman.\n\"I was settled at Manchester United, I had even just ordered a new kitchen, but they wanted to sell me,\" he said. \"In what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes? \"Of course, you can refuse to go, but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. I don't agree that players control the game. \"There have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers, but I have turned them down. What's the point?\"\nWednesday's game at Old Trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between United's young attackers Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and Milan's veteran defence of Stam, Paolo Maldini, Cafu and Alessandro Costacurta. Stam says Rooney's teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game. \"We can't all be Wayne Rooneys - at his age I was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone,\" he said. \"Starting late can be a good thing. Some kids who start early get bored. \"I had my youth - having fun, drinking beers, blowing up milk cannisters. It sounds strange but it's a tradition where I grew up in Kampen - and I had done all the things I wanted to do.\"",
    "Dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, Media Labs Europe, is to shut down.\nThe research centre, which was started by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts. Since its opening in 2000, the centre has developed ideas, such as implants for teeth, and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. The centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. In a statement, Media Labs Europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the Irish Government nor the prestigious US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was willing to fund it. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies, in an attempt to regenerate the area.\nAbout three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the Labs' long-term survival. The Labs needed about 10 million euros (US$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. \"In the end, it was too deep and too long a recession,\" said Simon Jones, the Labs' managing director. Ian Pearson, BT's futurologist, told the BBC News website that the closure was a \"real shame\". BT was just one of the companies that had worked with the Labs, looking at RFID tag developments and video conferencing. \"There were a lot of very talented, creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society. \"I have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost.\"\nNoel Dempsey, the government's communications minister, said Mr Ahern had been \"very committed\" to the project. \"He is, I know, very disappointed it has come to this. At the time it seemed to be the right thing to do,\" he said. \"Unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate.\"\nDuring its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. In recent months, 14 patent applications had been filed by the Labs. Many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. Several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. The Human Connectedness group, for example, developed the iBand, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. This information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. Other projects looked at using other human senses, like touch, to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment, or on the body itself. One project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. The Labs, set up in an old Guinness brewery, housed around 100 people, made up of staff, researchers, students, collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. It is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the Labs close on 1 February. According to its latest accounts, Media Lab Europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about US$10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million euros (US$3.3 million).",

    "A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.\nThe drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits. But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.\nApproximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK. Many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.\nNow, GW Pharma's Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. \"We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,\" said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.\nThe UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex's launch in the UK. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p.",
    "The nuclear unit of Russian energy giant Gazprom is reportedly facing a 1bn rouble ($35.7m; £19.1m) back-tax claim for the 2001-2003 period.\nVedomosti newspaper reported that Russian authorities made the demand at the end of last year. The paper added that most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company's export activity. Gazprom, the biggest gas company in the world, took over nuclear fuel giant Atomstroieksport in October 2004. The main project of Atomstroieksport is the building of a nuclear plant in Iran, which has been a source of tension between Russia and the US.\nGazprom is one of the key players in the complex Russian energy market, where the government of Vladimir Putin has made moves to regain state influence over the sector. Gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm Rosneft, the company that eventually acquired Yuganskneftegas, the main unit of embattled oil giant Yukos. Claims for back-taxes was a tool used against Yukos, and led to the enforced sale Yuganskneftegas. Some analysts fear the Kremlin will continue to use these sort of moves to boost the efforts of the state to regain control over strategically important sectors such as oil.",
    "Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen.\nAlan Archibald prodded United ahead in 19 minutes and James Grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later. Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. Tony Bullock in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley. Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless.\nUnited restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. Jason Scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing Crawford and he coolly beat Ryan Esson from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. Grady received a pass from Crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of Esson. The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from Esson to keep out Robson's drive after 62 minutes. The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area.

    "The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.\nPrivate sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\nThe ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\n\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\nA slowdown in the housing market and this year's surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"",
    "UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered £960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.\nIn a speech, he called for action to reach the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. Mr Brown has just returned from a tour of African nations. The £1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health.\nThe chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK's Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday. Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra £0.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation. That could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. As well as pledging £960m over 15 years to the immunisation IFF, Britain urged other donors to contribute.\nIf Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued. Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. War on Want's John Hilary said: \"Compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. \"As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.\"",
    "Belgian brewing giant Inbev has seen its profits soar thanks to its acquisition of Brazil's biggest beer firm Ambev last year.\nInbev, which makes Stella Artois, said pre-tax profits for 2004 rose 56% to 1.16bn euros ($1.5bn; £800m), and said it expected solid growth in 2005. The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",

They also have a good record at the Stade de France, having won their first two games there, in 1999 and 2001. Wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed Italy 38-8 in Rome.\nKevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing.

    "You can now buy \"trusted computers\", but can we really trust the PC vendors, asks technology analyst Bill Thompson.\nIf you have recently bought an IBM ThinkVantage computer, a Dell Optiplex, or one of a whole range of laptops from Toshiba, HP/Compaq or Samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (TPM) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to children's toys. But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. And as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. A big advantage of the TPM is that it is hardware-based.\nAt the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. It might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor.\nHardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. This is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers. As a result we settle for second best. So when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward. After all, if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. And if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. Instead you have to use special software, like HP's ProtectTools or Wave Systems' Embassy. This provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks. Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows, \"Longhorn\". This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the \"Next Generation Secure Computing Base\", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. However there is a downside to the increased security from viruses, spyware and data theft that this will provide.\nBecause the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (DRM) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them. We have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. Users of Apple's iTunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other iTunes users, a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection.\nBut the latest version of iTunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a CD. Another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from Real's Harmony service on your iPod. Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. Similarly, users of TiVo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows, and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it. One wonders whether hardware-based DRM will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. It will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. Once it is unlocked then someone, somewhere, will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. And once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. The efforts going into DRM would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. The record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us, most of the time, will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. They will benefit more by building a market in which I can share songs with my friends, record shows I want to watch later, and burn CDs for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.",
    "Britain has offered to send a company of 120 Gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia, Downing Street said.\nThe deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province. Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.\nHowever a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in Indonesia which the Gurkhas might be able to help with. The spokesman said: \"Following this morning's daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort, the government has formally offered the Indonesian government the assistance of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters. \"This is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean.\"\nIndonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami, with 94,000 of the 140,000 confirmed deaths so far. International Development Minister Gareth Thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of Aceh. \"We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment,\" he said. \"We've also had RAF aircraft flying in equipment which the UN desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in Aceh province as well.\" The offer comes as the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw arrives in Indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast.

    "Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\"",
    "Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was \"out of control\" during the \"wild\" 1960s.\nLucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as \"Precious\" at school. Despite being told he was a \"nutter who died at sea\" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound found out about it last year. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.\nMr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: \"I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead.\" He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a \"set-up\" but he then realised all the dates fitted. \"It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,\" said the Ealing North MP. \"I don't blame Lucy's mother. I was pretty much out of control. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.\"\nMr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since. Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: \"The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. \"We were finishing each other sentences.\" Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.",
    "Japan's box office received a 3.8% boost last year, with ticket sales worth 211bn yen (£1.08bn).\nThe surge was led by animated movie Howl's Moving Castle, which took 20bn yen (£102m) to become the biggest film in Japan in 2004. It is expected to match the 30.7bn yen (£157m) record of Hayao Miyazaki's previous film Spirited Away. Japan Motion Picture Producers figures showed that 170 million cinema admissions were made in Japan in 2004. The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, was the biggest foreign movie hit in Japan last year, taking 13.8bn yen (£70.7m).\nIt was followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Finding Nemo and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The second highest-grossing Japanese film was romantic drama Crying Out Love in the Centre of the World, followed by Be With You and Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation. Japanese films accounted for 37.5% of Japan's box office total last year, with foreign films taking the remaining 62.5%. This represented a 4.5% gain for the proportion of Japanese films in 2004 compared to 2003. The number of Japanese films released rose to 310 in 2004 from 287 the previous year. Sales of movies on DVD and video amounted to 497bn yen (£2.54bn) for the year.",
    "Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be \"the most accessible browser on the market\", according to its authors.\nThe latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"\nAnother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.\nThe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "Stan Lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit Spider-Man movies.\nMany marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stan Lieberman, got a job in Timely Publications, a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, now legally adopted.\nBy the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\nLee's answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee's life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York's skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\n\"Just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee's influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.\nIn 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. His latest project is a superhero based on a real person - Jay J Armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. But his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, The Hulk and Daredevil have all been turned into Hollywood action movies in the last five years. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. It seems Stan Lee is as indestructible as his heroes.",
    "One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.\nYoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan's most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\nMr Tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn't let me use the silk futon, saying it's a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan's troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank's bad loans.",

    "Ulster clung on for a morale-boosting Celtic League win over bottom club Borders at Netherdale on Friday night.\nA late try by Borders substitute Jonny Weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the Scottish side could not complete the fightback. Ulster had led 20-6 with tries from Paul Steinmetz and Bryn Cunningham. But the Irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. Calum MacRae surrendered possession before centre Steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. Substitute Joe Pattison - who had come on for the injured Gareth Morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.\nThe speedy Steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving Adam Larkin an easy conversion. Ally Warnock clawed back three points for Borders, but they were soon hit by another double-blow. First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward. Larkin again added the extras. Even worse was to come for Borders when Larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to Kelly Brown being sin-binned. The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end. And he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory. \"Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time,\" said McCall. \"In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.\"\nMorton, Moffat, MacRae, Hore, Berthinussen, Warnock, Moore, Thomson, Ford, Douglas, Blair, Stewart, Gray, Brown, McEntee.\nKay, Parr, McGee, Rennick, Weston, Millar, Pattison.\nCunningham, Maxwell, Bell, Steinmetz, Howe, Larkin, Campbell, S.

Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March. \"I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen,\" Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday. \"I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago.

    "Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\nTreasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare.\n- Increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60,000 \n - A freeze on petrol duty \n - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \n - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than £60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to £150,000 in February.\nThe Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn.\"\nBut Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\nFor the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a £2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.",
    "Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was \"one of the proudest nights of my career.\"\nThe Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: \"It was a really great night. \"The players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans. \"We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances. For Liverpool, this result is very, very important.\" Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. The Reds scored three second-half goals in a sensational comeback capped by Gerrard's 20-yard drive. He added: \"Steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game.\n\"I have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us. \"I felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters, I cannot thank them enough. \"I want to say thank-you to the supporters, they were magnificent to help us achieve this result.\" Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time. He said: \"I'd be lying if I thought we were going through when we were losing at half-time.\n\"We had a mountain to climb, but we have climbed it and credit to everyone. \"That was one of the best goals I have scored, I caught it sweet, I haven't caught one like that for ages.

    "Music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.\nThe debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser's dream come true and a branding nightmare. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing 'oxygen' for companies that support illegal downloading. \"You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,\" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.\nHe urged people to follow his lead and 'dump' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. 'Networks like eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses,\" it said. But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\nThe reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. \"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,\" he said. \"If you put the legality issues aside, not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience,\" he added. Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical. \"We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. It is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks,\" read a statement from the discount phone firm. It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.\nHowever Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said. \"I would be surprised if these brands didn't have the know-how to prevent this happening,\" he said. At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. \"Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity, including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - Senator John Kerry and President George W. Bush,\" said chief executive Sam Yagan. There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network, he thinks. \"Peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they're most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media,\" he said.",

But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.\n\"You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible,\" says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. \"It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.\" Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.\nMainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing \"export quality\" rap.\nThe web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its \"infant stage\". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. \"He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,\" Millan says. \"He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world.\" Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. \"Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,\" Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.\nBut one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. \"It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now,\" Millan says. \"And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing.\" Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.",
    "More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests.\nTheir biggest worries are not terror threats, but over-regulation, low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.\nGlobal business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandals in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. Across Europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called IFRS. Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.\nAlready, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a \"significant threat\" or \"one of the biggest threats\". But PwC's global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.\nAccording to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: \"One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won't kill your business anymore.\" Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. Mr DiPiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had \"adjusted\" to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.\n - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.",
    "Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said.\nHowl's Moving Castle set a Japanese box office record last week, taking 1.5bn yen (£7.7m) in its first two days. Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. Howl's Moving Castle is based on a children's fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones. It tells the story of an 18-year-old woman who ages dramatically after falling under a witch's spell. She heads to a moving castle kept by Howl, a wizard, and searches for a way to become normal again. A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film \"has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike\". \"We have a good feeling about this film. We saw very good viewer response,\" he added. The film's worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January.",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\nSlower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\nAnd recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\nBusiness groups welcomed the MPC's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"",
    "Aston Villa's Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.\nThe striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. \"Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge,\" said Villa boss David O'Leary. \"I won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea.\" Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because O'Leary had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villa's manager's problems in that department.",
    "The US has pushed Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, under the US Department of Energy. IBM test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The previous top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocked up 35.86. The Top 500 list was announced on Monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world.\nIt is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second.\nOnce completed in 2005, Blue Gene/L will be more powerful than its current prototype. \"Next year with the final Blue Gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat,\" said Erich Strohmaier, one of the co-founders of the Top500 list. It will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers.\nIn second place was Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at the US space agency's (Nasa) Ames Research Center in California. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second (teraflops) in October. It will be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The defeated Japanese contender, the Earth Simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity.\nSince the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.\nThe draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. \"There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,\" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.\nIn December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.",
    "Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet \"rogue-dialling\" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.\nIt has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge. Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. They must warn people earlier about possible fraud, Icstis said.\nPeople who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. Victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: \"Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. \"If my bill goes over the usual £50 a month I want to know about it straight away - I don't want to be told when it's hit £750.\"\nPhone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said. \"We alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers,\" he added.\nTelecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said: \"Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary. \"So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach.\" The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.\nGavin Patterson, group managing director for BT Consumer, said \"We do look at customer's calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. \"We're looking at the moment at whether we can improve this.\" But as BT handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was \"quite a task in itself\", he added. The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. At the moment, it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down.\nI use free anti-virus software (AVG) and free firewall protection (ZoneAlarm). Both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter's love of music sites. How about ISPs informing all customers of such facilities? The responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues.\nIgnorance is and always has been an expensive business.\nDoes any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised? The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ?\nThese diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal MP3s, porn and pirated software. If people didn't visit such sites they'd be considerably less at risk. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? It seems everyone has to be a 'victim' these days!\nPart of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. A secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user's knowledge.\nThese scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. They should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. Or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going?\nWhy don't BT et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request? To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. After you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions, they cannot insist on you paying the bill. To do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. No customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills.\nDisable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. Or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. You would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your PC? Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault!\nI was very impressed with our phone company recently. I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number. Great service. And I got the tickets as well!\nI have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. Three months later another huge bill of over £1,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place. Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.\nI have been scammed of £139. The operator will do nothing about this and, to add insult to injury, I was charged VAT by the government.\nPremium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.\nI know people who have run up large bills, despite being IT-literate. From talking to BT in Belfast, I believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. It's not the fault of phone companies, and at last they are doing something about it.\nIt's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! Not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly.\nI haven't \"fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam\" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. In most cases the user is entirely at fault, which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them.\nMy telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal £3 to £5, to £320. This was because of the scam. They simply billed me. What particularly galls me, over and above having over £300 stolen, is that the supplier and the government (through VAT) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses.\nHow about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted? That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. At least any disputed amount would be limited, far easier for a telecoms operator to write off £20 than it is £750.\nA few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection.\nHow about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date? That should prevent the vast majority of these scams.",
    "Shares in Cairn Energy, a UK oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.\nThe company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable. Cairn's shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year. Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he was \"disappointed\" with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan. Investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a \"significant downgrade of the initial expectation\".\nCairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. The company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; £10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. A spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field's current value.\n\"Cairn refutes the government's position,\" Mr Gammell said. He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - India's state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - and not the contractor. \"We have a pretty strong legal case here,\" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statements though. The shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. \"I think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,\" said analyst Jason Kenney at ING.\nThe disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for Cairn's existing oilfields. The company raised targets for its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in India from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. \"These two fields will provide the core of the future developments in Rajasthan,\" Mr Gammell said. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to South Asia from interests in the US and Europe. Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.",

Sony has billed the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan.

    "Shares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had deepened to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m.\nThe UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and \"operating flaws\" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.",
    "Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan has praised striker Robbie Fowler for his landmark return to form.\nThe 29-year-old, out of favour at City earlier this season, took his Premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in Monday's 3-2 win at Norwich. \"He is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did,\" Keegan said. \"He has worked hard to get back to where he is now.\" The former Liverpool striker, who moved to City in 2003 after a poor stint at Leeds, has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season.\nFowler overtook Les Ferdinand on Tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the Premiership, with 151 goals, and he only trails Alan Shearer (250) and Andy Cole (173). And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward. \"He can get better if we can supply him better,\" added Keegan. \"People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face.\" Fowler's double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards. \"I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington,\" he said. \"His team have got great character, they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm. \"I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership. \"The stadium and the atmosphere is great, it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know.\"",
    "Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, D dal Maso, P Griffen, M Barbini, KP Robertson.\nG Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.\nR McBryde, J Yapp, I Gough, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, K Morgan.\nAndrew Cole (Australia).",
    "Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner.\nGlobally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly \"must-have\" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.\nCamera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.\nMobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.\nImages from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.\nThe exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said.",
    "David Beckham expressed his relief at Real Madrid's passage to the Champions League knockout phase.\nAfter Real's 3-0 win at Roma, the England skipper admitted another season of under-achievement would not be tolerated at the Bernabeu stadium. Beckham said: \"It's expected of Madrid to get through, but it's a relief for the club and players to have won. \"We lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything.\" Real's finish as runners-up in their Champions League group means they cannot face his old club Manchester United in the next round. But Real could be drawn against other Premiership hopefuls, Arsenal or Chelsea, who won their respective groups. \"It's going to be great whoever we play, even if we don't get either of the two English teams.\"",
    "Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.\nThe Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets. The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current £7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.\nFor many deaf people, especially those born deaf, BSL is a first and preferred means of communication.\nUntil now, the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator. \"In the past, I've used textphones but they have problems,\" said Robert Currington who is taking part in the pilot. \"I communicate in BSL; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message.\" \"I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply.\" The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call. \"There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people,\" said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels. \"In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. \"By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group.\"\nOfcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. And new technology, including the Video Relay Service, will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. But a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation. \"Any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider,\" he said. Mr Currington, like many of the UK's 70,000 BSL users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available. \"The relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure,\" he said. \"I can show my emotions more easily in BSL in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls.\"",
    "Pop singer Delta Goodrem has scooped one of the top individual prizes at the first Australian MTV Music Awards.\nThe 21-year-old singer won the award for best female artist, with Australian Idol runner-up Shannon Noll taking the title of best male at the ceremony. Goodrem, known in both Britain and Australia for her role as Nina Tucker in TV soap Neighbours, also performed a duet with boyfriend Brian McFadden. Other winners included Green Day, voted best group, and the Black Eyed Peas. Goodrem, Green Day and the Black Eyed Peas took home two awards each. As well as best female, Goodrem also took home the Pepsi Viewers Choice Award, whilst Green Day bagged the prize for best rock video for American Idiot. The Black Eyed Peas won awards for best R 'n' B video and sexiest video, both for Hey Mama. Local singer and songwriter Missy Higgins took the title of breakthrough artist of the year, with Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian taking the honours for best pop video. The VH1 First Music Award went to Cher honouring her achievements within the music industry. The ceremony was held at the Luna Park fairground in Sydney Harbour and was hosted by the Osbourne family. Artists including Carmen Electra, Missy Higgins, Kelly Osbourne, Green Day, Ja Rule and Natalie Imbruglia gave live performances at the event.",
    "Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.\nInvestors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia's listed firms. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,\" said ABN Amro's Eddie Wong. \"[But] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.\"\nIndia's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\nThailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\nIn the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.\nHowever, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. \"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. \"The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.\nHe told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell said the country's health rates were \"lamentable\" not least because of smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\n - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \n - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \n - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500 \n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \n - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. \n \nMr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.\" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: \"Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.",

    "Carlos Moya described Spain's Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA's challenge in Seville.\nMoya made up for missing Spain's 2000 victory through injury by beating Roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"I have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day,\" said Moya. \"All my energy has been focused on today. \"What I have lived today I do not think I will live again.\" Spain's only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia. And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: \"The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset. \"Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way. It helps me reach my goals if I am obsessed. \"It's really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.\" Spanish captain Jordi Arrese said: \"Charly played a great game. It was his opportunity and he hasn't let us down. \"He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him. \"He had been waiting years to be in this position.\" Spain's victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.\nAged 18 years and 185 days, the Mallorcan became the youngest player to win the Davis Cup. \"What a great way to finish the year,\" said Nadal afterwards. US coach Patrick McEnroe wants Roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. \"I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.\" \"Obviously it's unrealistic to say that we're going to just start playing constantly on clay, with the schedule. \"But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff,\" said McEnroe. Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville's Olympic Stadium. \"It's just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world,\" said the American. \"I had my chances and just didn't convert them. The bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. \"They came out, took care of business and they beat us. It's as simple as that.\"",
    "A senior Tory MP has criticised agriculture department Defra's \"lackadaisical\" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.\nPublic accounts committee chairman Edward Leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The National Audit Office said Defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. But Mr Leigh said the department was \"dragging its heels\".\nThat comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. He also said Defra had been \"dreadfully slow\" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.\nThe outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the UK up to £8bn. \"Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and £40m of invoices remain unpaid,\" Mr Leigh said. Mr Leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an IT system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.\nMinisters had hoped to get £900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. That was because the UK had valued the culled animals at between \"two and three times\" the commission's assessment of their likely market value. National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. On the issue of the unpaid invoices, Sir John said Defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001, \"but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations\".\nMr Leigh said being \"better prepared\" would also help avoid the need for \"mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak\". A Defra spokesman said: \"We welcome the report. It acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak. \"However, the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.\"",
    "Microsoft has entered the desktop search fray, releasing a test version of its tool to find documents, e-mails and other files on a PC hard drive.\nThe beta program only works on PCs running Windows XP or Windows 2000. The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded with firms touting programs that help people find files. Search giant Google launched its desktop search tool in October, while Yahoo is planning to release similar software in January.\n\"Our ambition for search is to provide the ultimate information tool that can find anything you're looking for,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president at Microsoft's MSN internet division. Microsoft's program can be used as a toolbar on the Windows desktop, the Internet Explorer browser and within the Outlook e-mail program. The software giant is coming late to the desktop search arena, competing with a large number of rivals. Google has already released a desktop tool. Yahoo is planning to get into the game in January and AOL is expected to offer desktop searching early next year. Small firms such as Blinkx, Copernic, Enfish X1 Technologies and X-Friend offer tools that catalogue the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer. Apple will release a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to be released with the Tiger operating system.",
    "US hip-hop duo OutKast have capped a year of award glory with three prizes at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.\nThey won best group, best video and best song for hit Hey Ya! after getting five nominations. R&B singer Usher won best male and best album for Confessions, while UK rock band Muse were named best alternative act and best British artists. OutKast will add their awards to the four they won at the US MTV Awards in August and three Grammys in February. Not only was Hey Ya! one of the biggest global hits of last year, but OutKast have been widely acclaimed as one of the most exciting and innovative acts in music. Their double CD album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which saw Andre 3000 and Big Boi each produce one disc, was hailed as the album of 2003 by many critics.\nAndre 3000 thanked fans \"for supporting OutKast throughout the years\". \"We really appreciate it,\" he said. \"I hope you don't get tired of us, but we only do what we do.\" Also competing for best group had been the Beastie Boys, the Black Eyed Peas, D12 and Maroon 5. And Anastacia, Britney Spears, Maroon 5 and Ludacris had been on the shortlist for best song.\nOutKast did lose out in the contest for best album - which was won by Usher, another award favourite. Usher, who performed a duet with Alicia Keys, also beat off competition from Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly and Robbie Williams to take the best male crown. He had four nominations going into the ceremony, with seven artists nominated in three categories.\nEminem's group, D12, were surprise winners in the best hip-hop category, beating the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nelly. Eminem told the crowd: \"D12 finally won an award, thank you very much.\" The rapper opened the show with a performance of his songs Like Toy Soldiers and Just Lose It, for which he was joined on stage by a crowd of children. The Black Eyed Peas - who had a global hit with Where is the Love? - picked up the prize for best pop act, beating Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams and Britney Spears. Spears was named best female, sending a message of thanks on video saying the award \"means so much to me\". Alicia Keys, Anastasia, Avril Lavigne and Beyonce Knowles had featured alongside her in that contest.\nLinkin Park singer Chester Bennington described their prize for best rock band as \"quite an honour\" while Muse said their win for best alternative act was \"a real surprise for us\". Muse were also named best UK and Ireland act, ahead of Franz Ferdinand, Natasha Bedingfield, Jamelia and The Streets. Referring to the fact that winners of 11 of the 12 main awards were from the US, Muse singer Matt Bellamy said: \"There needs to be more European bands.\" The 11th annual awards were hosted by hip-hop artist Xzibit and watched by 6,000 people at the Tor Di Valle arena, plus millions more on TV around the world. The ceremony featured performances from the Beastie Boys, who entered the stage on bicycles and skateboards, No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani being lowered from a giant clock and Nelly doing a duet with Pharrell Williams. MTV also organised a huge open-air concert featuring Anastacia and The Cure outside the Italian capital's ancient Colosseum, with some estimates putting the attendance there at 200,000. Last year's big winner at the MTV Europe Awards, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, was Justin Timberlake, who walked away with three trophies.",

But Dallaglio, who called time on England earlier this year, said: \"I assure you I wouldn't let anyone down. \"I know what it takes and what I have to offer,\" he told the Daily Telegraph. Dallaglio toured South Africa with the Lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to Australia three years ago.\nThe 32-year-old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf-life.

    "The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.\nAgriculture Minister Adamu Bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; £591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.\nCocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. \"People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,\" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. \"The farmers in the village never see any assistance,\" he added.\nAt the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.",
    "Germaine Greer has criticised Celebrity Big Brother's \"bullying\" of housemates after quitting the reality TV show.\nShe said \"superior\" bullying tactics, like making housemates cold and hungry, could encourage playground bullying. She also condemned the \"complete irresponsibility\" of adding Brigitte Nielsen's former mother-in-law Jackie Stallone to the house on Monday. Nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children, Greer said. The feminist writer and broadcaster said Big Brother had behaved \"like a child rather than a parent\" by taunting contestant John McCririck after denying him a cola drink. \"I thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground,\" Greer said. She also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking \"agendas\".\n\"I had no idea who would be in here and it's wrong for me to present myself in the same context as they are.\" Media observers had been surprised by Greer's initial decision to join the third celebrity version of the Channel 4 reality TV show, given that she has written critical articles about the format in the past. As she packed her suitcase to leave the house she told fellow housemates: \"I'm leaving over specific issues, but best for everyone if I don't discuss them. \"I have a problem with decisions, I make them fast and when I make them, I stick to them.\" Greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against Big Brother.\nOther celebrities to walk out of a reality show TV include Sex Pistol John Lydon, former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook and ex-E17 singer Brian Harvey who all left I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Previous Big Brother housemates to leave before their time were Sunita Sharma and Sandy Cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.\nVOTE   Was Germaine Greer right to leave Celebrity Big Brother?   Yes  No   Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion\nHappy Mondays dancer Bez is now 2-1 favourite to win the show, followed by Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie at 5-2 and actor Jeremy Edwards at 4-1. Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush said that the series was still \"wide open\", adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on McCririck slashing his odds to 8-1. DJ Lisa I'Anson is the outsider with odds of 40-1, while Jackie Stallone, who joined the house on Monday, is also one of the less popular housemates at 20-1. The first eviction of the series has now been postponed after Greer's exit unexpectedly reduced the number of competitors. The eight remaining contestants are competing for a £50,000 prize, to be donated to the charity of their choice, if they survive a series of public votes. For every 50p vote cast by viewers by telephone or text during the programme's run, 9p will go to a tsunami charity appeal.",
    "Tony Blair has pledged to \"never, ever, ever\" attack Tory leader Michael Howard over his Jewish beliefs.\nThe prime minister told the Jewish Chronicle: \"If you look at what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically.\" Mr Blair also distanced himself from recent Labour campaign posters featuring Mr Howard, which critics claimed were \"anti-Semitic\". These were \"not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the Jewish community,\" Mr Blair insisted.\nOne poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs. Another pictured the Tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said echoed the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.\nOthers compared the image to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. Labour has since taken the designs of its website, saying members had preferred other designs. During his interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Mr Blair said: \"I've been a very strong supporter of the Jewish community and Israel, and will always be so.\" Pressed on whether he would draw attention to Mr Howard's Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, he replied: \"The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. It's untrue. \"If you look what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically. I would never, ever, ever attack him on that basis.\"\nMr Blair also defended his party's attitude towards the Jewish community, pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the Holocaust Memorial Day. He added that Labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism.\nNeither the Conservatives nor the Liberal Democrats wished to comment on Mr Blair's words. The prime minister was speaking as London's Labour mayor Ken Livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a Jewish reporter from the city's Evening Standard newspaper. Mr Blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter, Oliver Finegold, to a concentration camp guard. Mr Livingstone \"should have withdrawn the comment immediately\" once he realised the journalist was Jewish, said Mr Blair. \"I'm sure that is what in truth he wants to do. Well, he should do it.\" Mr Livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made, and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper. He conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.",
    "Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venice's famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.\nViotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milan's La Scala and the Vienna State Opera. His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet's Manon last week.\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti's last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Vienna State Opera.",
    "Legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the man credited with developing \"total football\", has died aged 77.\nReferred to in the Netherlands as \"the General\", Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Cup - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Germany. However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final. Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971. His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world. The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football. Michels had recently undergone heart surgery and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: \"He was one of the best coaches we had in history.\" The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, named coach of the century by world football's governing body Fifa in 1999, also won five caps for the Netherlands as a bruising centre forward. Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp said: \"He was the man who, together with Cruyff, made Dutch football big.\"",
    "The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.\nStaff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered. US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.\nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand \"what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath\".\nAdding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate \"sickout\". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.\nUS Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.\n\"US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,\" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was \"embarrassed by the situation\" and \"deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,\" The probe will focus on the industry's compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair \"deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline's crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,\" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.",
    "Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else's agenda.\" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can't change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves.\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn't going to be there in New York, that's been taken out of the equation.\" \nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.\"",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.\nRates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August. Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.\nRising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.\n\"Today's no change decision is correct,\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"\nMr Frost added: \"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"\nOn Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\n\"So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.",
    "Germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.\nGross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. It is the nineteenth month in a row that the ECB has not moved borrowing costs. Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.\n\"During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,\" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt. \"If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.\" Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. They have also warned there are more cost cutting measures on the horizon.",
    "Tony Blair has launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a \"ludicrous improbability\".\nThe prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure. Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut £35bn in \"wasteful\" spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts. On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing \"inefficiencies\" which had \"burgeoned\" under Labour. In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.\n\"I believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government.\" Mr Blair added: \"They, the Conservatives have learned nothing.\" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed.\nMr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. \"So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight.\" In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education. \"Everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,\" he said. Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for \"huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy\". \"The public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a Tory government,\" he concluded.\nGordon Brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny. Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be \"distracted or diverted\". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: \"We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.\"\nMr Brown warned that the Tories were planning \"the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto\". Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of \"misrepresenting\" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans. \"He still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools, hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,\" Mr Letwin said. \"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans?\"",
    "British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.\nThe Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. Another 7% said they would not vote at all. The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006. The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.\nBallot papers in the poll will ask: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?\" The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.\nThe treaty was signed by all 25 current EU members in Rome last October and is due to come into force in November 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote. Meanwhile, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\".",
    "Ray Charles, who has won a string of posthumous Grammy Awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.\nHis sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent UK beat and R&B scenes.\nCompared in stature to Elvis Presley by some commentators, Charles' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison. His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the \"devil's\" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.\nWithout Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett. He was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock 'n' roll greats, including I've Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What'd I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael's sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack.\nHe also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of Hank Williams standards such as Your Cheating Heart and You Win Again. More than 40 years after its release, his 1962 ABC album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is still regarded as a classic. His version of Don Gibson's I Can't Stop Loving You topped the pop and R&B charts in the US. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People.\nOn it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a \"brother in every sense of the word\". \"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did,\" he said. Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes. \"I'm quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,\" he told BBC News Online. \"I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever.\"",

Warriors' goalkeeper Murambadoro, who made a name for himself at the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia, helped Bnei Sakhnin overcome Albania's Partizani Tirana 6-1 in the previous round. Murambadoro moved to Israel recently after a brief stint with South African club Hellenic. The club won the Israeli Cup final last season and are based in Sakhnin, which is near Haifa.

    "The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.\nShe told the Guardian newspaper there would be no \"Las Vegas-style\" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes \"a pile of pants\". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. \"You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots,\" Mr Pound told the Today programme. \"I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,\" he said.\nMs Jowell complained of the \"scale of misrepresentation\" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to \"protect children and the vulnerable\" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: \"We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing.\" And continued: \"We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way.\" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.",
    "The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor.\nNew owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers. It also plans to develop a \"worldwide entertainment concept\" with the brand, although details are not yet known. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.\nIn the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.\nThe Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.\nTulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run. The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m.",
    "The 2005 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is a geek's paradise with more than 50,000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event.\nTop gadgets at the show are highlighted in the Innovations Showcase, which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. The BBC News website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005. \n \nOne of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files. The 2.5GB and 5GB circular pocket hard drive from Seagate might help. The external USB drive won a CES best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket. \"It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool,\" said Seagate. \"It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality.\" \"It is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy,\" it said. In the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures. \n \nUniversal Electronics' NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house. It can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. Working with home broadband networks and PCs, the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful, simple interface. Paul Arling, UEI chief, said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. He said the Nevo gave people a simple, single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. The Nevo won two awards at CES, one as a Girl's Best Friend award and another for innovation, design and engineering. The gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (£425). \n \nHotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its Solo Chassis gaming chair. The specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own \"space\". It is compatible with all the major games consoles, DVD players and PCs. \"We found that kids love playing in surround sound,\" said Jay LeBoff from Hotseat. \"We are looking at offering different types of seats, depending on the market success of this one.\" The chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos, with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. And a drinks holder. The chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in April and is expected to cost $399 (£211). \n \nSatellite radio is big business in the US. In the UK, the digital radio technology is known as DAB and works on slightly different technology. Eton Corporation's Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US. DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. \"It is for the risqu&#233; consumer,\" said an Eton spokesperson. \"We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.\" The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. In the US is it expected to cost $250 (£133). \n \nThe average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES. This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years' time. One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo's tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months. A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. \n \nWearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. MPIO's tiny digital USB music players come in an array of fashionable colours, taking a leaf out of the Apple iPod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. Slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. Although the pendant design was launched three months ago, the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends. An even dinkier model, the FY500, comes out in May and will store about 256MB of music. The range of players recently won an International Forum design award 2005.",
    "The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\nJob creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.",
    "The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).\nThe Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal. Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.\nThe Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk.\nBut critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. According to Menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. \"We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,\" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. \"The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today.\"\nMenatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to \"virtually nothing\" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%. According to its Paris lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case. But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. \"Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,\" he said.\nYukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep. He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.",
    "Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nThe fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox.\nThe thrust of this year's show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. \"The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,\" Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website. \"It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.\"\nConsumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. \"This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. \"Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,\" said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the \"democratisation\" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple's iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.\nThe CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft's Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January.",
    "Web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.\nThese online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. The most well-known examples include Iraqi Salam Pax's accounts of the US-led war, former Iranian vice-president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign. There are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last November.\nThe blogging movement has been building up for many years.\nAndrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. \"You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before,\" he says. \"And blogs were a key part of that transformation.\" Among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying \"we are sorry\" for George W Bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio. \"We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas,\" he told the BBC News website. \"But they followed the story, they didn't lead it.\"\nSome parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.\nOthers, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content. \"I don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. It is in transition, as society itself is in transition,\" says Mr Nachison. However, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. \"The one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, it is threatened. And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse,\" says Mr Nachison. \"The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't, that's gone forever.\" \"With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.\"\nIt seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.\nBut the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. Tools such as Google's Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog. US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. But experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay. \"We are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other,\" said Mr Nachison. \"And there's going to be bad that comes with the good.\"",
    "China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.\nThe move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. \"Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,\" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website.\nSome of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.\nThe Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.",
    "European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro.\nThe European single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months. Tacit approval from the White House for the weaker greenback, which could help counteract huge deficits, has helped trigger the move. But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden.\nChina is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar. \"Asia should engage in greater currency flexibility,\" said French finance minister Herve Gaymard, after a meeting with his German counterpart Hans Eichel. Markets responded by pushing the euro lower, in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the G7 industrialised countries next week. Early on Tuesday morning, the dollar had edged higher to 1.3040 euros. The yen, meanwhile, had strengthened to 102.975 against the dollar by 0730 GMT.",
    "Most areas of the US saw their economy continue to expand in December and early January, the US Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book report.\nOf the 12 US regions it identifies for the study, 11 showed stronger economic growth, with only the Cleveland area falling behind with a \"mixed\" rating. Consumer spending was higher in December than November, and festive sales were also up on 2003. The employment picture also improved, the Fed said.\n\"Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest,\" the Beige Book said. \"Several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.\" The report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. \"Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington DC, and New York City, two of the nation's strongest commercial markets,\" the Fed said.",
    "Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.\nMr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair. A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.\nThe event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, Mr Brown replied: \"You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy.\"\nHe refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. Mr Brown later told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\" Downing Street cited that comment when reporters' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe\". Labour's new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign \"which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country\".\nConservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: \"The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H.\" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.\nThe prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a \"scorching\" from MPs.\nOn Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: \"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.\" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked.",
    "Spectators were evacuated from Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and Real Sociedad.\nMore than 70,000 people abandoned the ground with the score at 1-1 and only three minutes left to play. The Basque newspaper Gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. But after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs, the police said that no explosive device had been found.\n\"The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything,\" said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. \"The best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us.\" Madrid midfielder Guti told private Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: \"I have never seen this before and sport should be above it all.\" Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. It is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand.\nIf the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. Initial reports suggested the Basque separatist group ETA may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. The Bernabeu was targeted by ETA on 1 May, 2002, when Madrid were about to play FC Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. A car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club.\nAnelka was quoted in a French newspaper as saying he would like to play in the Champions League for a bigger club. But chairman John Wardle said: \"I've spoken to Nicolas and he's apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the French press. \"We are a big club. Nicolas told me that he agrees with me that we are a big club.\" Wardle was speaking at the club's annual general meeting, where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker. The club still owe French club PSG £5m from the purchase of Anelka in May 2002. He has been linked with a move to Barcelona and Liverpool, and Reds skipper Steven Gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at Anfield. But Wardle added: \"There's been no bids for Nicolas Anelka. No-one has come to me and said I would like to buy Nicolas Anelka.\n\"If a bid comes in for Nicolas Anelka I will speak to the board and then speak to Kevin Keegan. \"If there was a bid and it was a bid of substance and worth taking then between us we'd decide. \"We still owe some money on Nicolas which we have clear out, so it would have to be above that.\" Wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips. He added: \"I've no intention of selling Shaun Wright-Phillips. \"If someone comes with a silly bid I'll have to discuss it. \"But we're not putting him on the shelf to sell. He is the heart and soul of this club and has his heart and sole in this club, and he would be very upset if I put him in the shop window. \"He was an academy kid here, he's just signed a new four-year deal, I don't think he'd do that unless he wanted to play for Manchester City Football Club.\" City recently announced debts of £62m, but Wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the January transfer window. He said: \"Like Kevin I'd like to see some players come in. We've got to see what we can do - whether it's a on a Bosman or not. \"We will try to be creative to generate some funds. But maybe we have to start looking at clubs like Everton and Bolton to see how they have been dealing in the transfer market and do a similar type of thing.\"",
    "The Conservatives would stand up for the \"forgotten majority\", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.\nThe Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values. In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. Labour says the document offers only a return to a \"failed Tory past\". The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.\nCampaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster. Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto. Other chapters will follow in coming weeks.\nIn a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the \"forgotten majority\" made up the backbone of Britain. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. He says in the manifesto foreword: \"They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair.\"\nSaying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue \"down the path of ever rising taxes\". He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall \"bureaucrats\". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. \"The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,\" he says.\nMr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. Mr Howard told BBC News: \"I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep.\" The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. It had nothing to do with putting \"clear blue water\" between himself and his opponents.\nLabour's election slogan will be: \"Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again\". Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of \"launching Thatcherism in instalments\" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September. \"The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust,\" he said.",

Radcliffe's career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the \"Big City\" marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. \"Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,\" said Radcliffe. \"I don't pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. \"I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. \"It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.\"",

    "Film-maker Spike Lee says black representation is stronger than ever in cinema and TV but the true power in entertainment lies behind the camera.\nThe She Hate Me director urged students at his old Atlanta university, Morehouse College, to seek \"gatekeeper positions\" behind the scenes. Lee told them to \"work up the corporate ladder because everybody can't be an actor, everybody can't make a record\". He spoke as part of a discussion panel, then led a retrospective of his films.\nReturning to his old university, which educates only African American students, Lee discussed the challenges facing black people in the entertainment industry. \"Even Denzel (Washington), he's getting $20m a movie. But when it comes time to do a movie, he has to go to one of those gatekeepers,\" Lee said. He told aspiring young film-makers in the audience not to ignore non-traditional routes to getting a movie made, including raising funds independently and releasing films straight to DVD. \"It's a huge market,\" the 47-year-old director said. \"It's not something that should be looked upon as a stepchild.\" Lee has made more than 25 films, including Jungle Fever, Do the Right Thing, Summer of Sam and 1986 hit She's Gotta Have It.",
    "Your computer can now help solve the world's most difficult health and social problems.\nLaunched this week, the World Community Grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems. The donated processor cycles will help the WCG create virtual supercomputers via the net. The idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop PCs. One of the most successful collaboration projects was Seti@home, run by the Search for Extra Terrestrial Life project, which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication.\nAnyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the WGC website. Once installed, the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process, and reports back after completing that task. The first WCG problem being tackled will be the Human Proteome Folding Project, which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold.\nThe subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences, and technology. The body will evaluate proposals from leading research, public and not-for-profit organizations, and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year. Organisations also represented on the board include the United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organisation.\n\"The World Community Grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues,\" said Elain Gallin, program director for medical research at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. \"[It] will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems\", she added. IBM has donated the hardware, software, technical services and expertise to build the basic infrastructure for the grid.

    "Cult British group Portishead have revealed they are writing their third album, their first in eight years.\nFounding member Geoff Barrow told BBC 6 Music the record was well on the way to being completed. \"We're actually into it as we speak. We took some time off for Christmas, but generally we're doing another record,\" Barrow told the digital radio station. News of their album plans comes after confirmation the Bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam's Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.\n\"We've just had our heads down really, we've never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. \"So for us it just seems, even though we haven't played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven't released a record for a long time.\" Portishead will not play any new material at next month's concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Other acts appearing include Liverpool band The Coral and former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Dummy was a critics' favourite in 1994, hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.",
    "Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.\nNew figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor's 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.\nThe economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.\nMr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. \"The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,\" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. \"But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.\"\nConsumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. \"The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,\" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was \"much less alarming\" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which \"are no indication of broad PPI pressure\", were responsible for the increase, he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said \"it is a good bet these increases won't stick\".",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "I'm seriously really upset at second boss vault of stars. For a pure melee rogue it's next to impossible to help with the ice. Since we're pretty squishy as it is if you're standing on ice for more then. 5 seconds you're dead. That's insane but I can dodge and shit so whatever. But the aoe the boss does for ice just randomly hits after putting a red circle around u. Like it's really hard to dodge as I haven't found its timed at all.. Again I can get past that. What I can't get past is the god damn icicles. It's literally impossible as a melee character to help get your team broken out. The ice surrounding it hits insanely hard which is fucked. So I can't be near it. If I so happen to hit one good encounter and break them out it explodes and kills me. So which leaves me with one option tunnel vision. Which does the job  UT only once every 60 seconds. Ice happens every 20 so wtf am I to do. Help if there is a way",
    "I'm not sure if this has been discussed before, but I wanted to bring it up because it's been a while, and it doesn't seem like this issue has been fixed... Every time and I mean, every single time I paricipate, regardless if I finish 1st or 5th, the game takes me to last place. The  moment i reach the finish line it starts loading and keeps loading until everyone has run \"passed\" me and obviously loaded the finish faster than me.... Is this a thing that's meant to be happening? Recently I actually managed to fishish first for the first time and that was only because everyone else had somehow lagged so much behind me that it managed to load before they finished, which is even more purplexing because it means it's not a techical issue that happens all the time. It seems to be more like a bad design choice.... It's extremily frustrating especially since the run itself is also prety frustrating... Is this an issue worth reporting? Is it my wifi??, I mean it's not good, but that's just unfair... I heard someone else here was having the same issue... Is this how the runs go, do you have to finish like a good minute before everyone else to get first place???",
    "As the title says, I got this extreme feeling of wanting to drink women's milk from her tits. I don't know if there is a link for that, but I always want to do it. Even if she's not pregnant. I want to like keeping sucking till some comes out. Maybe, when I have a wife, I'll be sucking on her tits while she's pregnant with our own baby😂. But, right now, I want to just suck on some female's tit for some milk. Maybe, it's because I wasn't able to do it as a child since I was allergic to a lot of things as a baby, so I couldn't. But, now, I'm fine. I don't care if the woman's tits are small or big. I just want to suck them for the milk🤤😂😂. Like a milk vampire🤣. I'll probably get off just by sucking them dry🤤",
    "Not exactly sure where to post this but I thought this was a good one. I recently moved in with my good friend from high school after graduating college in May. Things are good between us, I have known him since middle school and we get along great. The rough thing is I am and have always been jealous of him. He's a tall attractive blonde guy with natural good looks and I am let's say not that. I have come to terms with not being super attractive a long time ago but it is tough to hear him talk about all the girls he rejects or gets with. He just seems happier than I am with his life, I work IT and make a sizeable salary while he works part time with no degree and takes a nap for most of the day. He just seems better than me at all of our shared hobbies. I don't want these feelings to ruin our friendship because he is a good friend but I find myself getting more annoyed at it after moving in. Any advice?",
    "I finally got around to giving my retriever a bath today after a month. He's been itchy these past few days and I figured a bath would help him. He's prone to itchy skin from time to time due to food allergies to environmental allergies. I used a medicated anti-itch shampoo. Just now my brother started grilling me about what I used to bathe him with to what I used to dry him with after, because he was scratching a lot. I agree, he is still scratching, but no more than he was these past few days. I felt slighted cuz I feel like he's indirectly blaming me for making the dog itchy. And today's my birthday and I chose to spend a quiet day at home relaxing and giving my dogs a bath and my day just got ruined by that. He couldn't keep his mouth shut and blame me tomorrow instead...I'm sorry if I sound petty. I just feel sad suddenly..I wanted a day where I could mentally escape and just let my stress go and he completely ruined it and made me feel bad..",
    "I had zero anxiety about getting this shot, I’m a perfectly healthy 26 year old male. However, I had a terrible experience getting the first vaccine. Two minutes after injection, my ears start ringing and I become lightheaded. Next, my vision starts to blacken and become distorted. This intensified for several minutes and I was sweating an insane amount. At this point I’m freaking tf out because I can’t see nor can I hear and I know I’m like the only person having this experience. I did not flag anyone down I just waited in panic hoping my senses would return. After what seemed like a lifetime, but was only 3 minutes, my vision started to return and I suddenly got freezing although I continued to sweat. I left feeling like I just had intercourse against my will, and I also did not tell anyone at the site. I now feel very reluctant to get the 2nd Pfizer dose and am overall just still shocked I had such a terrible experience. Has anyone experienced something similar? Should I have told someone?",
    "I've only dated one person and I loved her with my whole being and she said the same to me but then she cheated on me and whenever we fought she made me feel like it was my fault. We tried to make it work but she kept talking to him behind my back and then she started to distance herself from me broke up with me and immediately fucked around with him saying that she didn't love me anymore when a week before she was saying how much I meant to her. Couple months later they stopped being together and we got together again after talking for a while and she said she started to like me again but then suddenly completely stopped talking to me saying she realised she didn't miss me that much and then blocked me everywhere and seems to be with him again. I don't know what I feel, I feel used, unlovable and worthless. I get massive panic and anxiety remembering everything and I've tried to kill myself three times and two times had to be taken to the hospital. She's the only person that's actually made me feel loved. It's like I have no value or reason to be respected.",
    "I’ll try to be as brief as possible: I was diagnosed with depression around five years ago, when I was only 17, after I tried to commit suicide. As a consequence, I started seeing a therapist while also taking medications. And I actually saw some improvements. However, Everything went downhill Two years ago, when my mother passed away. She was the person I loved the most in the world, and the only one who never made me feel guilty about my problems, so because I am dumb as fuck I just disappeared, never contacted my therapists again, stopped my medications, and moved to London while also taking drugs and leading a very wild life until I almost killed myself. I have now come home for nearly one year, and I made the hard decision of starting therapy again. Last week I went to see a psychiatrist that a friend of mine suggested me to see. After he asked me a few questions whose answers I am not sure he understood since he kept interrupting me, he told me, “Listen to me, kid, you are not sick, or depressed, look at yourself, you are all pretty and dolled up, you are probably just sad because your mum died, you simply need to toughen up and get over it, and you’ll be fine” I Was shocked. I left his office crying, and now I am totally at a loss. Should I give up on therapy? Should I see thiS guy again and give him a second chance? I don’t know what to do.. maybe I am just destined to be miserable.",
    "I am 16 and own a 66/80cc 2 cycle motorized bicycle I recently came across an issue with my carburetor leaking fuel due to the float needle not stopping the flow of gas coming from my tank, therefore, causing the carb to overflow. I did not know how to fix this issue so I installed a flow valve on my fuel line with the flow valve installed I can turn on and off the gas flow to the carb. To fix my issue I turn on the fuel valve thus allowing gas to flow into my carb and once the carb starts to leak I turn it off, now that I have my carb filled with gas I can ride my bike for about 2 to 3 miles before running out of gas in my carb I then fill it back up by turning on my fuel valve. I know this is not the best solution and am probably decreasing my engine's life span but it is all that I came up with. I then thought why not get rid of my gas tank altogether and just oversize my carb's float bowl. Please let me know what you guys think of this idea and if I should patent it or not.",
    "Just something that came to me recently while thinking of the past games I've played. My first console game was My Street for the PS2, which was a fun minigame fest with games like RC Kart, Dodgeball, and Volleyball. I spent so many hours playing My Street with my brothers and even just by myself against the CPUs. And looking at the games I like now, I can say My Street has definitely influenced my preferences. I love games like Mario Party and Mario Kart, and the LittleBigPlanet series was one of my favorites to play and explore all the custom worlds other players made. So I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences with their first video game and their video game preferences.",
    "I started self harm from 6th grade. It got to a point where even if a tiny problem would arise in my life, I would turn towards my razor. It was my guilty pleasure and it turned into an addiction. I couldn't function at that point without this. Fast forward a few years later, and I'm trying to give up my addiction. It isnt easy and 4 to 5 months pass and I get stressed to a point that I cannot handle it and I relapse. I've been thinking that whenever this happens, I look towards my razor, but should I instead go for Vaping? I know my parents will never allow it because I live in a society where mental health is disregarded and mental disorders are not real. But still, if I were to ever get my hands on a vape, should I? I get stressed like that once every 4 5 months so I will not be smoking constantly. However I will still have an exit ready for me. Is it worth it?",

Having  a good enough body but just a smaller chest with inverted nipples , he made me feel little about my 2 insecurities and never enough . I still held on until now but I’ve begun to question is it worth it ? Will someone love me better ?

    "Sooo you know how every character has 3 lives in the Dream Smp? How did they get those 3 lives in the first place? What if the second and third lives are just copies of the FIRST life. You may say this makes no sense but how do you just die and come back all fine with all your memories? Also there is a book called the revive book on the server which only dream possesses and has been used TWICE. Once on Tommy and once on Henry his pet cow. Which shows that the revive book can be used multiple times and the person you used it on gains all their memories after revival. So what if you can revive the \"copies\" or your \"lives\" that you have lost through the revive book basically creating infinite copies of you with all your memories. I mean they have to go some where right? The dead have to go somewhere RIGHT? Comment on this post if you think this theory is viable or its just bs. Also I have another question that is how or who created/found the revive book and gave it to Jschlatt who then gave it to Dream?",

While we were FaceTiming each other, one of her guy friends asked to call her and she asked me if it was ok for her to answer.

    "So I've recently finished The Betrayal of Jimmy and played halfway through Jimmy's Vendetta. The missions are actually awful and some are even ripoffs of the main storyline, the Chinese restaurant shooting for example. Also what does it mean that they are in an alternate timeline? Why does the Mafia universe have different timelines? There also isn't any real lore, which was the strength of the main campaign. Instead we got a few scenes and a character we know very little about and isn't even connected to anything in the main story. The only positive thing to say is that you can explore the open world after the campaign is finished, which is one of my few points of criticism in the main storyline. How can those DLCs be so bad and boring. Should I even try to continue or should I cancel playing them? Also what about Joe's Adventures? Is it also worth playing, or is it as bad as the Jimmy DLCs?",

It's stupid but I thought of using text to speech and just having a static image of my face, but i can't even do that cause the text to speech for my language is horrible.

I really like the owner and wouldn't want to screw him over when the time does come to leave. When accepting a new position, how do you go about the whole two week notice thing? Are employers actually cool with saying,\" Oh I can start in two weeks.\"? It feels to me like an employer might be upset or go with someone else if you can't start soon/immediately, but that may not really be the case in the professional world.

    "Title pretty much explains it all, my cat hates his wet food. I know wet food is much better for cats than the dry stuff, but my little guys just won’t eat it 95% of the time, I put it out and he turns his head an walks away. I’ve tried many many different types of food, and he doesn’t like any of it. He absolutely loves the dry stuff though, sits there and meows and begs for it constantly. After a while of him not eating the wet stuff I usually end up caving and giving him the dry stuff cause, obviously, I don’t want him to starve. I know cats are supposed to eat the wet stuff, that’s where they get most of their fluids from and it’s just better in general, so I’d like to get him to eat it, but he just outright refuses most of the time. On the rare occasion he does eat it, he’ll just eat like half and then leave the rest. What the heck can I do? Should I just give up on the wet stuff and only give him dry? He does have a fancy little water fountain that I see him drinking out of, so I know he isn’t dehydrated, but the lack of eating good food is a bit concerning. He’s about 5 years old, and has kind of always been this way, but recently has gotten worse. I even bought him some special bowls because I was worried it might be whisker fatigue, but that hasn’t helped either. If anybody had any advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",

All I could think of was you. I wish I could take you out for eel sushi, and I’d get your favorite beer, and your favorite bread. It would be so worth it to know you’re eating properly and see the huge smile you get on your face whenever you have your favorite food. We could do something really special together. Now thinking of that money opens up a pit in my stomach I’ve tried to think of something else to use it on but it all pales compared to you.

I hope no one said anything rude. I pray for your safety every day. I can never stop loving you, and I don’t think I’ll ever climb out of this dark pit.

    "So I’ve been learning the basics of forex and when to take trades through IM academy. Basically I know more or less when to take a trade through hourglass using the Cashtrap strategy. It shows you possible trades you could take. The educator says that just using indicators on hourglass you could win 60-70% of your trades. I’ve learned the point system they use to have more confirmations to know whether or not a trade is good to take or not. The problem I’m having is that the educators seem to kinda of repeat themselves over and over and I don’t think I’m learning anything more than what they are saying. They are trying to pass it off as something so simple when in actuality it’s not. I follow the strategy exactly how it was taught but I still seem to lose. I paid a lot of money to learn this and it’s starting to feel like a scam almost. I understand that the market does it’s own thing and you can’t predict right every trade but following everything I’ve been taught I still can’t seem to predict right. I have good and bad days but it’s confusing to know where I should be placing trades and I feel helpless because the educators are on repeat mode every time they go live.",

    "Now I know Victreebel can get swords dance and everything good mainly in postgame of fire red making the only real moveset I want to go with for him is razor leaf, body slam, toxic or acid, and maybe double team or rest. Victreebel isn’t the best in the older gens or maybe he is I have no idea. But I’d love to know what you think maybe I can give him other moves I’m deciding on either him or exeggutor and I really don’t know what else to use the rest of my team is gonna be Charizard, Primeape, Lapras, Raichu, and Nidoking and Victreebel is getting the 6th spot if I can find him viable, this is for ingame only also and I have access to get a bellsprout cause my brother has leaf green, I’d love to hear what you guys think and thanks.",
    "my best friend would always comment on my moms ass, tits, etc. he would always say how he fucks her yk the usual shit. until i came home early from playing basketball and i see my best friends car in the driveway. i go inside and it’s quiet but my moms home bc of covid. i go into her room to ask why he’s here to see my childhood best friend fucking my mom. she hurried for her clothes and that’s when i saw his dick. it had to have been at least 9 inches while i’m only 3 inches. while my moms rushing for clothes he tells her to stop and that he wants to see what’s in my pants. my mom didn’t say anything and neither did i do he came over and choked me against the wall and dropped my pants. he made my own mom take a picture or our dicks next to each other and then told me he wants to keep fuckign my mom. obviously i said no and we were going back and forth until he just holds me down and ties me up with bedsheets. he forced me to watch him fuck my own mom. she loves every part of it and was so surprised to see how much bigger his dick was",
    "I just watched fragment of trash taste how they lambasted Kazuya for that thing with not running after Mizuhara and i m wondering... I know when i started reading i felt he was pain in the ass but kinda understand where all those things he did come from and just gave him some pass. His pervert side is still annoying but i feel like it is author trying to be  funny but failing mostly. Otherwise he is really great later on even this situation when he said sorry to Mizuhara for not running after her made me sad for the guy and later on there where more moments where i really felt some emotions after him trying to open himself or trying to be brave. Is it really that bad in anime or am i just incel feeling bad for other incel ? I felt really down in my life for quite some time so i relate to characters with low self esteem especially this low like Kazuya, because it's uplifting when he tries to fight for himself out there.",
    "Ages ago it has its battery changed; after it wouldn’t turn on with the battery plugged in nor would the battery take any charge. It has done little other than sit since unused since then. Recently I decided I’d try using it so I readied a bootable El Capitan usb as it’s hard drive is completely blank, but the MacBook wouldn’t turn on. I eventually found out that holding down the power button for 10 seconds and then plugging it in continuing to hold down the power button for another 10 seconds. When it does turn on the fans are full blast and whether it’s to El Capitan install, High Sierra install, internet recovery, or the hard drive from a know working MacBook it will only make it a little past halfway before shutting off and coming back on again only to repeat. If it is turned off anyway other than when it shuts itself off the 20 second power button thing has to be done again. I’ve tried an nvram/pram reset and the option+command+shift+power to no avail. On the inside there’s no evidence of water damage. I’ve been trying at it for two days now and I’m out of ideas as to what the problem could be.",
    "I feel so incredibly anxious. I can’t sit still. After a rollercoaster emotionally abusive relationship that lasted two years and after 1 year sharing an apartment together, I moved across the country for a while. After a month of not seeing him, I’m back. I’m seeing him tonight. The level of anxiety I feel is unreal. I can’t sit still for more than a few moments without feeling nauseated with unease. We wanted to meet up to get closure for everything that happened, but it was a toxic relationship. He begged for me back a week ago and has been standoffish the last few days. He told me he’s incredibly depressed and wants to want to seek help, but it seems that he won’t. He’s erratic in his communication and seemingly his feelings toward me. He says he feels like it’s going to be weird to see each other and I feel the same, to an extent. Despite everything he’s done and everything that’s happened, I miss him and am excited to see him. I don’t know whether or not that’s wrong.. people who are close to me tell me that I shouldn’t see him at all. I can’t help but feel drawn to him, even if it’s for the last time. Advice on how to handle this situation?",
    "Started a new job, its kinda scary not physically knowing who your teammates are. I mean chat chat pero iba pa din like 1st day at sabay-sabay kayo kakain, tatawa kayo pag lahat kayo nahihirapan, etc. It kinda feels like on your own dba. Parang zoom meetings feel awkward din, saglint lng and like its kinda different din like having the vibe of someone working beside you and making chikka. Its awkward just inviting people na \"hey magzoom tayo para lng may presensya\" and it doesnt feel the same. Anyone who can give advice on how to handle this scenario? I guess its the feeling of uneasiness din sa new role, new company and before pandemic, hadn't realize the value of having people starting with you.",
    "Their motivation is pretty weak to be honest and Marvel's attempt to connect their motivation with \"The Blip\" makes absolutely zero sense either.  Like what motivated them to do what they do in the show? We got a glimpse of it like wanting the life before the blip to come back and \"blip refugees\". Why are the blip refugees struggling exactly? Why the life after the blip sucks even more? I'm not saying that every single question have to be answered ,but the way they try to make the audience sympathize with the Flagsmashers just doesn't work. Maybe they could have showed us a small glimp of the struggles people faced after the blip and the struggles the blip refugees are going through ,but none of it was hinted properly at all. It was just \"bad\" things that's happening and we're supposed to relate with that suddenly.",
    "I am like 90% sure Isayama was made to make the ending more digestable. Why, you ask? All we have to do is look at the Season 2 ED. EVERYTHING is a reference there, EVEN THE FUCKING BABY is in there. Do you know what was in there that we've never seen? The mass of people wandering away. Those surely had to be the collossals turning back. This in itself is not the reason why many people dislike the ending, but I can surely say that some things were fucked with, and I doubt that that was the only one. I can even imagine some executive telling him literally after 138 that \"yeah man your shits fucked up no way we can have those characters die. figure it out\" Jean and Connie were brought back without even them getting brought back. They just kind of.. appeared? I don't know, maybe it's just my last dose of copium, but I am convinced that this was not that was envisioned.",
    "I am about a month into this hobby. I got myself a giant trance x. I walk with a cane do to a hip injury I received from a motorcycle accident when I was younger. Over the last year I have lost 168 lbs and wanted to strengthen my leg muscles before my hip replacement surgery. I told my doc I want you to have to work to get to my hip after I put on all this muscles lol. My legs were so weak. I started riding a beach cruiser about 8 months ago and was able to build up to a 20 mile ride, but I was limited on where I could go because of not having gears. Now I have open up so many doors with this bike. Me and my brother did our first climb two days ago. Holy crap that was one hell of a workout. It is a 14 mile ride with elevation gains of 2200 feet. We were only able to do like four miles with a gain of like 500 feet. The ride down just from that far up the hill got me hooked. This hill now has become my unfinished quest and i will beat it. It feels so good to have purpose again in my life and to seek out these challenges that are hard instead of running away from the hard things like I use to do.",
    "Title basically. I have an iPod Mini I recently upgraded, swapping out the 4 gig hard drive for a much larger compactflash card and it's eventual home will be a little cabin I'm building on a plot of land out in the middle of nowhere. It's being stuffed full of audiobooks and radio plays, including from my sizable Audible collection. At the moment I'm downloading my books, converting to MP3, splitting into chapters and then putting on the mini. This is mostly automated for me with the toolchain I've put together with shell scripts, but still takes a pretty long time. The mini is compatible with Audible formats 2, 3 and 4 which would greatly simplify things into drag and drop but for the life of me I can't get audible's servers to spit out the old formats. Is it impossible or is there a trick I'm missing?",
    "Just got home from a visit with my GI doc. Wasn’t even a visit, it was more of a lecture. He canceled my GES. I’ve been waiting for it for so long. He says that he found that I am lactose intolerant and that must be what is causing my symptoms. I was on a lactose free diet and I saw no fucking difference. Lactose intolerance isn’t nausea every single moment of your life. Lactose intolerance isn’t eating and vomiting the undigested food a couple hours later. He didn’t even give a shit about how much weight I’ve lost. I was so fucking overweight before my symptoms and now I can barely get it above 105 lbs. I’m not fucking crazy. I went to that appointment so bloated that I looked pregnant. Nobody listens. My mom doesn’t care. My dads a doctor and even HE won’t listen to me. He says he doesn’t want me on gut stimulators because I’m under 18 and they cause abdominal pain. Abdominal pain? That’s my middle name at this point. My mom is calling my primary doctor now to adjust my anxiety meds because I broke down when we left that appointment. Wanna know why I’m anxious and depressed? BECAUSE OF THIS FUCKING HEALTH CONDITION. GOD DAMN IT. What the hell do I do? Do I need to say my symptoms in French since nobody seems to understand them in English? Why won’t anyone listen to me?😭",
    "I know that I am overly quiet in social situations, and that it’s because a lot of the time I overthink anything I might say. Most of the time it keeps me from saying anything at all. I feel like it makes people think I’m stuck up or unapproachable. People tend to fill in the blanks if you know what I mean. A lot of people will say I should try not to think so much and just say the first thing that comes to mind, but the thing is on those rare occasions where I don’t overthink too much and start to get comfortable so I actually talk to people I feel like a lot of the time I’m awkward, and in ways I can’t always quite put my finger on either. Like I put my foot in my mouth or overshare or just say odd things that people don’t know how to respond to. It all makes me cringe and go back into that overthinking mode and I feel socially inept. It makes me want to cry and be a hermit. I don’t know what I’m looking for here, maybe I just need to vent. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "So this post is going to be somewhat of a jumbled mess as I dictated in my car as I’m driving from my iPhone but I just had a thought after reading some news about student loan forgiveness and with all the money that’s been spent through the government I think there’s an agenda in motion to cancel Fiat currency and the future is going to be only a Cryptocurrency somewhat like China just did. the United States will probably create its own so I don’t know where that leaves all the currencies that we have now but I think it’s important that we invest as much as we can into these currency’s now. I can see the US dollar becoming worthless and these things come quicker than we realize it could happen within a year could happen within 10 years we don’t know my advice to everybody is put everything that you feel comfortable putting in the crypto currencies as you can. And thank you for reading this if you did. And please comment your thoughts",
    "Honestly, the storyline I'm most worried about in the show is the shipwreck storyline with Matthias and Nina. All the other storylines in the show, including the crows, tie in to Alina's story, and are all connected. But I feel like, especially for new viewers, the Helnik storyline is just gonna feel like a random shipwreck in a random part of the world with two random characters who we don't really care about and have nothing to do with the main storyline with Alina. I just feel like it will feel a bit random and disconnected to the rest of the plot, especially considering all the other plots are connected. Maybe they have come up with a sensible way to believably tie them together, but even then it doesn't really look like nina and matthias is gonna interact with or even meet any of the other characters, unless it's just one scene at the beginning or the ending. I think I am most worried about the fact that new viewers are gonna be confused and not really care about the storyline at all.",

Because of this I have found cooking and cleaning very difficult, almost impossible.  This had lead to me needing to order out almost every meal. Funds are dwindling and I'm getting extremely overwhelmed. I've been finding it very difficult to even keep trying. I've been in too much pain to effectively  take care of myself.

I feel like I can't even talk to my partner because they keep recommending therapy and while I know they aren't my therapist sometimes I just need to talk to someone. I moved to a new state in order to be with my partner a few years ago and have struggled hard with making new friends, got a better paying but less satisfying job, we're even expecting our first kid soon.

    "I don't want to be like this - I'm too old for this shit. I don't want to spend the rest of my life posting about my heartaches. I don't romanticize heartbreaks. I dont intentionally torture myself with thoughts of you, they just come to me - like a thief in the night, leaving me robbed and helpless. There's nothing sweet about this and I'm far too logical for this. I don't enjoy wracking my brain, trying to find words that would best describe how I feel - and every time failing because no words could really come close to how gut wrenching, soul destroying this is. I put into words how I feel because supposedly it helps - I haven't seen any result yet at all. There's only one thing that would help me - and that only comprises of three letters - YOU. I'm so fed up with myself. I have no fucking illusions, no grandiose dreams of getting back together, of a happily ever after. I've lived in the fairy tale we have created long enough - and I'm living now my reality. I'm tired to my bones of feeling this way...I just want to move on. I'm not harboring any negative thoughts about you or about myself - no blaming, it is what it is. Some relationships are not meant to last, and some people are not meant to be together. That is life and I'm well too aware of it. But fuuuuuck, the pain. I just want it to stop. Now. Not when I'm six feet under the ground and I wouldn't give a fuck at all. I don't want to continue going through this anymore. I have accepted that we are not meant to be. I'm not angry about that. Just please, let me be free of this pain. Cause I just can't anymore.",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country. Personally, I think the trans-atlantic alliance must end and we should go back into isolationism.",

    "When my son was seven I took him to Dover Castle.  Neither he or I were aware of specific hauntings at the castle prior to the visit.  After a great day we returned home.  On tucking my son up in bed that night we chatted about the day and he asked me about a woman he’d seen dressed in a long red dress.  I thought it odd, although he was clearly not scared but more intrigued by her enough to ask me who she was.    I had not seen anyone matching the description although had been with my son throughout the day.   I thought nothing about it until a day or two later when, out of general curiosity I googled the castle and discovered that it is famous for being haunted with several ghosts one of which was a lady in a long red dress exactly where my son had seen her.",

I just tried another movie tonight and I had it set to direct stream, but it failed converting again. I had the mode set to auto, so I changed it to force and it loaded up super fast but said it couldn't detect any audio. So it played the direct stream 35mbps 4k beautifully, but without sound.

The thing is when I pee I don’t feel any burning it comes out normally. But after I pee i still feel the pain maybe even worse. It also feels like I have to pee when I don’t. It just feels all inflamed and burning inside of there. It’s been going on for I’d say 5-6 days now. The worse part is I’m on vacation and dealing with this sucks, I can’t even relax on vacation. I’ve had a hard time sleeping too. I made a doctors appointment for Monday. I’m just trying to see if anyone else experienced these symptoms.  It was worse when I took CBD too thought it would help. I’ve also been peeing a lot since this started too I guess my body is trying to flush this out if it is something.",

The recent 1.2 patch made it so you can make the “key item” icon on Johnny’s gear disappear by collecting all of his stuff and getting the Breathtaking achievement. Thing is if you decide to upgrade his gear from rare to epic then the epic version will have the “key item” icon and you won’t be able to get rid of them. Same thing if you upgrade the epic version to legendary. What you need to do is upgrade the rare version into epic then epic version into legendary before you get his pistol. Once you get the pistol all three versions in your inventory will have the “key item” icon removed from them. Then you’ll be able to delete them or store them in your stash or do whatever you want with them.",
    "I do group therapy with my family because my family is screwed up especially my dad and brother and every session ends with them blaming me for something and trying to convince the therapist I'm horrible. Recently they talked about how I dont enjoy doing chores, I dont do them because i score very high in school and it's very stressful. My therapist says they need to control me more. Keep in mind this is the person that's supposed to help me. Fast forward a week I pass my learners permit test, this day is probaly the only day I've been genuinely happy in about a month, and when I come home my dad just tells me to take out the trash. I tell him \" I'm eating right now, I'll take it out when I'm done eating\" and my dad is very childish and he likes control. So of course being the lazy fat and impatient dad he is, he says \"no do it right now\" so I say \"listen, i just got my permit, you are not going to ruin this day for me.\" And he says \"take it out by 5 30\". So I take it out because I'm not lazy like him, and now I'm mad and stressed out when I should be happy. I havent been happy for like 2 months and he ruins it. Take your own trash out you imbecile. Time to wait 2 more months to be happy, who knows if he will ruin it that time too.",
    "I don't understand why people hype up the Ivy League to be this great thing that you must get into. I personally didn't apply to any. Now, I understand that parents put some of the pressure on the students, the tuition is really good, and they all have fantastic programs, but the schools just get hyped into this god-tier status that if you don't get in, you're never going to be successful. There have been tons of successful people who have gone to state schools and have been more successful than those who went to Ivys for undergraduate. If you don't believe me, do a quick google search. Furthermore, jobs don't care about where you went to undergraduate. They care about what experience you have. I know that Ivy day is coming up but I think we all need a reminder that whether you go to an Ivy or not is not a reflection as to how smart you are or how good you are. Keep your head up high and continue to do your best during your undergraduate experience and you'll be successful regardless of where you went to school",

For the past three years or so, I have been consistently getting choppy haircuts with chunky layers that need to be fixed every time. I just got a haircut yesterday. The top 2/3 of my hair looks fine, but the bottom third looks about half as thick and very choppy and bizarre. I’m going to have to cut it again. I haven’t been able to grow my hair past shoulder length because this keeps happening. There’s no way that I just have bad luck picking hair dressers. It has to be something about my hair causing this, I just can’t for the life of me figure out why or how. Does anyone have any ideas at all? Has anyone else experienced this?",
    "In my opinion Charmx isn’t leaving. The fact that it still shows that he still has 2.4K videos is pretty fishy, they could all possibly be unlisted or maybe deleted which could suck for him. My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

    "Whilst playing in the Great War mod I was loosing a war of attrition. The allies had pushed me back almost to Berlin but then I mounted a massive counter attack on the Eastern front and reached all the way to Stalingrad which capitulated Russia. I was pleased to have so much land after such a long war. However, my happiness was short lived as I was slapped in the face by the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. But still I mounted a western front counter attack and pushed the allies back to the Benelux border. My attacks were green across the bord and the troops I had spent the last year preparing were making short work of the entente. But then suddenly out of nowhere I get hit by the Versailles treaty.

    "Hey everyone, what are some tips and advice on how to make your body smell extremely good 24/7? I would like recommendations from diets to deodorants to which fabric softener or detergent to use to wash your clothes, which product to use on your face and hair, which body wash, body lotions, body oils, perfume, showering technique, dental hygeine, flossing technique, anything, to use to make your body and mouth smell like heaven. I can make my hair smell really good, I use Amike Soulfood nourishing hair mask, Morrocanoil leave-in conditioner, Morrocanoil treatment, and Briogeo Anti-Frizz heat protectant. I have been complimented on the smell of my hair multiple times but I do not know how to make my body smell very good. Does anyone have any good body wash recommendations, body lotions, body oils, or perfumes to make yourself smell really good? Has anyone been complimented on smelling good all the time, and if so, what do you use? I have heard the Yves Saint Lauren perfume is amazing and I will buy that, but I was also thinking of just using something to smell good all the time naturally, not exactly with perfumes all the time. And by smelling good, I mean I really want people to constantly compliment me on how good I smell when they get closer, I am not really talking about just preventing from smelling bad or smelling neutral, or decent, but just smelling really good. Let me know, thank you.",
    "So last night my roommates, some friends, and I were having a good time having a bonfire. I decided to get wonky for the social gathering so I kept going back inside to my room to snort more ket. We have like 5 snakes and my roommate was showing one of our guests her snakes but one of them nudged the heat lamp keeping them warm when they were going back outside to the fire. Some time passes and I decided to go inside and snort some more ket. But when I go inside it smelled like something was burning but I didn't think much of it since we were having a bon fire. I proceeded to my room until I got near the reptile room and saw a bunch of smoke in that area. I freaked out and looked for the source and saw it had something to do with the heat lamp. I was so wonked I really didn't know what was starting to burn and catch on fire but I immediately ran back outside to inform my roommates something was catching on fire. They come inside and fixed the situation. Man, that was a close call. Thank god for my ketamine addiction and that I decided to get wonky af that night. I could've not have a place to live today if I didn't want to go back inside to continue the wonk. I just felt the need to share this with everyone. Thank you guys for listening to my experience last night. That was pretty scary when I finally thought about it.",
    "Our relationship is already stressed, and she is going through that phase everyone goes through where if someone dares correct her or politely inform her that she is making a mistake she blows up. I’ve done everything I can, and managed to find a ten gallon. It used to be in a five gallon, and a ten gallon was all I could find for her considering I’m broke from my own gosh and she wasn’t putting any effort into it. She comes to me with her fish problems but doesn’t listen to my advice when she hasn’t asked for it in regards to her fish’ safety. She told me a couple minutes ago that his stomach was looking a little big, he hasnt been swimming around much any more, and he isn’t eating as much/ at all. Tomorrow morning I convinced her to put him into a smaller container for a bit so I can get a good look at him and take a picture. Any suggestions?",
    "I’m still struggling in some aspects of the therapy. I’ve got the Amara View mask, which is comfortable enough. No problems falling asleep. Not snoring, which is great. AHI is generally between 4 and 8 while I can keep it on. But if the thing, Philips Dreamstation, goes 12 or over, i cannot breath out and end up almost choking on my own air. Doesn’t happen regularly. Maybe 2x in the last 2 weeks. I get a good, solid 3 hours after I initially fall asleep. After that, i’m usually up like at least 2 or 3 times and, recently, take the thing off after i hit about 4.5-5 hours just to get some sort of sleep. I don’t THINK i’m having claustrophobia issues. I’ve never had issues with claustrophobia in any other situations. I’m struggling to function during the day more now than before i started on the CPAP. I don’t know. I’m venting more than anything.",
    "Those of you in condo's and detached homes in Victoria, That have mini split heat pumps. How loud is your compressor unit outdoor? We had a two head unit mini split installed in August and it is loud as heck. The installer came out multiple times. Of course every time they came the unit wouldn't make the noise. It happens more at night and when it's really cold. I know they make noise but I feel like the amount of noise this unit makes is substantially louder than it should be. A friend of ours had one put in by the same installer. And his is whisper quite. I'm at my wits end on what to do. The installer keeps saying it's normal noise. But when the tv volume had to be turned up to drown out the noise of the outdoor unit. I feel like that's excessive.",
    "It gives me extreme anxiety when people come toward me for a hug or high-five. This is because everyone seems to do hugs or high-fives differently. In the milliseconds before someone hugs me, I think through how I will have to hold my arms, if they are going one arm up and one down or both up or both down or a side hug. For high-fives, it’s the same issue. Some people will grab your hand when you high-five, others have a weird pull you in for a hug thing, some grab your hand after slapping it and shake it or something. Anytime someone high-fives me, they look at me as if I am retarded when I try for a normal high-five because I don’t know what sort of weird-ass high-five they will try for. Sorry this is so long.",
    "I bought my first truck recently. It belonged to my dad’s boss who pretty much babies his vehicles. Only he let this sit for about a year. I got a pretty good deal on it considering which I wouldn’t normally do if my dad didn’t trust the guy. I couldn’t take it home at first because we found a fuel line leak. We repaired it and we jumped it and it ran really good. Until it died on an exit ramp. We got it towed home and it hasn’t started since. We’ve replaced the batter and now the ignition coil. It will turn over but it just won’t start. It’s an electrical problem because I’m not getting sparks from the ignition coil, hence the replacement. But still nothing. If I can’t get it fixed, the guy said he’ll take it back and give me my money back but damn I really want this damn thing to start. I hate that I can’t drive it or do anything with it",

    "I think when modeling for games the modifier aspect and the non destructive workflow puts blender above most 3D packages in this regard. One thing that is essential though when working with a high to low poly workflow is keeping the geometry relatively simple and be able to adjust it without having edgeloops around every corner. Maya's crease set tool was very good at that and I wonder why someone has not released an addon for that yet, I would really pay any amount for such tool since it would speed my workflow a lot. Don't tell me that you can do this using vertex groups cause it just doesn't make the cut, is too messy and the values of the crease get lost when you start to have a more complex model. Maybe it is too difficult to create? I would be happy to fund it. Let me know what you think.",
    "Signed up for Fraser’s HWPO app and was looking forward to it but it’s been a complete disappointment so far. Didn’t get a password email like the first email today said I would. Figured out I could do a password reset and get into the app. Got into the app and didn’t have the program in there. Checked back a bit later and it had shown up so got my hopes up that issues were over. Not so much. App is SUPER slow, nothing will load and all I can get to is a list of “Day 1, Day2, etc” if I click them it just spins and loads. Has been a complete let down so far. I’ve used various fitness apps before and all of them have been pretty decent and seem to be built on a pre-canned template app that whatever celeb throws their name on and was expecting similar for this one but not so much. This is like a freshman programming class tried to do a school project and failed at it hard. Anyone else get different results?",
    "Like two months ago I was using my newly acquired prostate vibrator, so to get things into perspective I was laying in my back inside my bed just chilling with the vibrator in while I tried to meditate and then suddenly, out of fucking nowhere a huge wave from my prostate flew through my whole body, it was so fucking pleasurable and only took like 4 seconds it even made me open my mouth as if I was about to moan, never had anything like it again, no cum came out it was just so good, after those pleasurable 4 seconds I thought \"I have no idea of what the fuck that was but I loved it\", that shit is the only reason I am still into prostate play cause after that until now I have felt nothing from it again not even a p wave I think, am I doing something wrong, and for God's sake someone tell me what the fuck that was",
    "One time I went to a party in Dahlonega, we started out at Taco Mac getting really drunk. I started getting really frisky so the two guys I was there with took me out back to where their truck was parked, turn down the music in there truck, and we started our own party. Of course I started taking my clothes off and dancing for everybody that had gathered. I brought one guy up on the bed of the truck with me and started putting his hands all over me. Eventually he started touching me and feeling me up, he took off my pants and started finger me in front of everybody. And his buddy got up on the truck push me down on my knees and stuck its dick in my mouth. They put me down on all fours and spit roasted me for a while... Then other people started climbing on the truck, a few other women took off their clothes and we all started sucking each other. Mostly us girls and the guys watching sucking on each other's tits, licking each other's pussy, trying to fit as many fingers as we could inside each other. But some guys were still up in the truck fucking us and putting bottles in us, and other things they were finding, not quite sure what was inside me at some points. But of course someone had to spoil the fun and eventually the cops showed and threatened to start arresting people if we didn’t pack it up.",
    "So recently all my purchased cards vanished from the client. I believe this had something to do with unlinking my original metamask address. I did this through support after linking my hardware wallet, as nothing has been minted yet I assumed all the cards would be minted to my new address. Apparently I was wrong, support didnt answer my questions about if unlinking my old address would have any negative side effects, they just did it and closed the case. They wont reply now the cards are gone and still havent replied after I made a new support ticket. I have relinked the old address to see if that would bring them back, but nope. Some people on here suggested I try the discord but that hasnt worked either. Starting to feel like I'm up shit creek without a paddle here.",
    "For a couple years now my 2009 v star 1100 was having trouble starting.  I would have to roll on the throttle slightly for it to start.  I recently found out that is a horrible thing to do on the v star.  All my research led me to find out that the tps sensor was the culprit.  To be in spec the tps sensor ohms have to be between 500 and 800.  Mine at its lowest setting was 1150.  I read multiple posts where people paid $165 for a new sensor and its was still out of spec.  The bracket that the sensor screws into is big enough to drill new holes right next to the existing ones so that the sensor can turn more and be within the proper range.  I drilled the new holes and tapped it with an M4 tap with 0.75 pitch.  It worked and the hard starting is fixed.nice to get the old girl back to normal.  I love the V star 1100 but pretty said that Yamaha made the sensor out of spec.",
    "Usually I play on PS4, but I still own my PS3 and recently installed it in the living room so my roommate and I could use it as a dvd player and we could play some old games together. However, when I wanted to let her play Journey, I found out the game disappeared from my ps3, I also cannot find it in my list of purchased games in my PS account either. The only evidence I have of ever owning the game on ps3 is a confirmation e-mail from the PS store when I bought it years ago and some trophies I earned are still listed on my profile. Has the game disappeared for anybody else? Does this have to do with PlayStation ending PS3 support? I apologize if this is not the place to ask this question, but I’m unable to contact PS support in my own country at the moment because they are “too busy”...",
    "Easter night. 98 years old. I got to hold her hand, touch her hair, and kiss her forehead. I got to say goodbye hours before she passed. I took pictures of her photos hanging on her walls, I took in the smell of her bedroom, I walked around her kitchen with family one last time. It was such a beautiful day, perfect weather, the sun was shining, birds were chirping. My aunt said to me \"when I hear the birds sing, I'll always remember mom.\" It broke my heart. I love my grandma. I love my family. Every family has its problems, I learned so much just from sitting and listening to my aunts and uncle talk that those problems just didn't matter. We are family. They had so much wisdom and love to give to me. They knew I wasn't very close with her, but they let me sit as long as I needed with her. I'm so happy I didn't wait any longer to see her. My brothers didn't get to say goodbye, only me. I feel lucky to have looked into those blue eyes one last time. I know she loved me and I love her. Rest easy Nan, tell Papa and Nick we love and miss them dearly.",
    "My son just turned 5 a couple of weeks ago. We always give kisses and hugs but I told him for awhile now that I don't want him to kiss me on the lips. I use the term inappropriate because it's the best way I know how to put it for him to understand. He sees me kiss my husband tonight and he said that I shouldn't kiss daddy on the lips. I explained that because mommy and daddy are husband and wife that it's okay. I told him that if he ever gets a wife, he can kiss her on the lips too. And he simply said \"or him\". I told him that is exactly right. He can love whoever he loves. I'm so proud that he even thought to say that because he has been around a few trans people but never a gay couple before. Love is love little dude. ❤",
    "Fast food has some kind of backroom deal with the pickle industry. Notice the hamburger pickle chips sold at the store are far thicker than the pickles on fast food burgers? They are also packed in a weaker brine, so the thick consumer chips require much higher brine content to maintain the pickle flavor. So while fast food gets paper thin, moist but not drenched, just as flavorful pickle slices: consumers are left with thick, sloppy pickle chips. It affects the profile of the burger. How many times has pickle juice washed your toppings off your burger, left your burger too high profile to add the other toppings you wanted, made such a mess with all the juice that anything else on your plate was ruined, or just made it impossible to hold your burger together with a couple of 1/3\" thick sponges slipping around on top drenching everything anytime you tried to grip it? If consumers had access to fast food pickles, they wouldn't rely on the fast food industry for low profile, topping worthy, manageable burgers. How entrenched is this conspiracy? Go to your local deli, buy one of those boars head pickles they have sitting in a jar on the counter, ask the guy to slice it thin with the deli meat slicer. They won't do it. Or go to Sam's Club and try to find fast food style pickles. You won't. All they offer is the thick consumer quality ones you can get at the grocery store. Even though their target customer is small business owners, they know regular consumers shop there too, and they won't risk any of us having access to fast food thin sliced pickles.",
    "The depersonalisation/derealization is increasing. Ive been mentally ill since i was 13, im now 23. The worst its ever been was in 2016/2017, and now its coming back severely. In 2017 i was diagnosed bipolar type 2, but my psychiatrists evaluation was short and he suspected schizophrenic psychosis as well. In other words schizoaffective disorder. I have a lot of trauma and cptsd symptoms. Ive painted since i was 5, and i cant describe with words all of the fantasy and creativity i have stuck inside my head. My paintings went from realism mixed with surrealism and now an increase in surrealism because of my dreams. I dont relate to most in my age and it makes me lonely and isolated. Most people dont percieve the world like i do even though i know there are some out there. But i cant find them. As im writing this im experiencing deja vu. I remember writing this before. I can see into the future but no one would believe me if i told them even though i can even prove it sometimes. I feel like i might not make it past 30 and i feel like this world is more of an illusion than we like to admit, but it doesnt matter. Im just exhausted and i dont know what to do.

    "So I’m terribly , horridly , confused about my sexuality . I’m a very very curious person by nature . I’m curious about everything . I’m a 17 year old girl in a homophobic family if that’s relevant . However , my friends and schools have always been very friendly and I’ve never been told that gay people were wrong by them . Lots of my friends have been bi , and it’s made me curious . I’ve fantasized about girls when I was 14, and these fantasies were sexual in nature. I had “crushes” on girls though idk if I should call them that . It was more being shocked at their beauty , and kinda fantasizing about them . Although if I ever had to date a girl I’d pass . Kissing a girl seems interesting but not desirable . I’d do it out of curiosity idk if I’d legitimately like them . When I was around that age , I’d wanted to be gay . Like I know how weird that sounds but I’ve had pretty bad experiences with boys . Lots of very poor male role models in my life , and my mom is pretty anti guys and tells me how awful all men are , when I was growing up . Some lesbians try to make themselves like men and even marry one right ? Could the same thing happen in reverse ? Fake attraction fueled by desperation. As of now , I find women beautiful the way flowers are , its aesthetic . My “crush” was extremely beautiful but I wouldn’t do anything with her not really . I’m so confused .",
    "\"We knew that fans were hungry for more Survivor--and so were we. We looked at this group of players and thought, 'these guys came ready to play.' And as always, we have to stay a step ahead of them. So we decided, let's put the game on fast-forward. 'You think you can take your time figuring out your strategy and looking for idols? Think again. Everybody else is talking and somebody already found the idol. And if you blink, you're voted out.' I think it's the natural evolution of the game. The last few seasons, every single vote is complex. Every single Tribal Council, the gameplay is aggressive and has consequences. So this is almost a response to that. 'You wanna play hard from the beginning? Got it. We'll make it harder.'\"",
    "I just got a request to help out the child of a person I haven't talked in 18 years. This old and close friend's wife disliked me so I was already on limited contact. But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

    "so Im 21.  My friends are all my age or younger and we are in our 3rd year of college.  They LOVE to drink.  I have since fallen back from drinking, and that has made me realize that I have little to nothing in common with them.  I like my friends a lot, but recently I noticed they tend to ignore my invites to do things that dont involve going to booze late at night.  Even normal, fun things that most people would like to do they arent interested in and will ignore my offer.  I get liking to drink, but holy fuck it seems like its their whole life purpose to get drunk.  This is a very hard time to meet new people as well, so I kinda just feel lost.  When i talk to them sober/when were not drinking and partying our conversations suuuuuuuuck.  Its like I just met them but these are people ive known for 2+ years.  I got a job on the weekends, and so far Ive had more fun at work with my coworkers than I have with my friends.  It sucks.  Its so stupid that society expects college kids to all be wild, unhinged, borderline alcoholics.

There is no battle phase on my turn one, so after performing actions, I'd ask if he has a response and he'd say no. Ok, my board is set and I end on Bow Wow and one Prank Kid. He allows me to set backrow. I declare End Phase and he says he Nibs me at the end of my Main Phase. Can he do that, I gave him several chances within the main phase even after I completed my combo?

    "So, I just wanted to make a little post about the condition of atheists and how it's like being one in this country. First of all, it's quite disheartening to see that literally most of your country's population loathes you for your opinions and lack of belief in religion. In most social media groups of our country atheists are seen as outcasts. Most of us here are closeted atheists since there's a pretty massive chance that our families won't take this matter well. Moreover, there have been a number of brutal murders of atheists whose \"fault\" was expressing their opinions, which lead to their demise. In my opinion, freedom of speech doesn't exist here and it's despairing being in a country where you can be murdered for your opinions.",

Então tipo, eu falei pra ela, que eu tinha me comportado a semana passada e eu queria comer chocolate né, e que tipo, por mais que eu faça as coisas direito, a gente tem a necessidade de comer um doce de vez em quando. Aí ela ficou puta, começou falar que eu preferia os doces do que os amigos, e na real, pra mim os dois caminham lado a lado na vida. Se eu não como doce eu fico estressado e se eu não tenho amigos, eu me sinto sozinho, o que me deixa triste e me leva a comer doce pra maquiar a tristeza.

    "GB is what go me into my love for hot sauce. I have bought a lot of it over the years. Recently I've noticed some small changes. The red sauce no longer has Japanese chilli peppers in the ingredients. The green sauce no longer has Mojo. Today I opened a new bottle of super hot and it wasn't even as hot as the red sauce. I shook the hell out of it and tried some more. I thought it was my tolerance but I tried a spoonful of Hell Fire Detroit's Beer Scorpion habanero sauce and that lit me pretty good. Perhaps that batch or bottle just lacks heat? I know GB isn't doing a private reserve anymore. Maybe the ingredient changes were to save money. I'd honestly pay more for it if it meant keeping the OG recipes. Maybe Dexter is getting tired of running the company? Maybe he is going to sell it?

    "I regularly lose all kinds of attraction for everyone,meaning no sexual or romantic attraction to anyone,meaning no desire to date anyone and looking at content and people that usually would make me feel feel sexually attracted stops doing just that.Those phases usually last between 2 or 4 months and I'm always worried that that my attraction will never come back when I have those phrases,however up until now it always has.Im pretty sure it's not sexual dysfunction becuase that doesnt include loss of romantic attraction and it doesn't affect me in any physical way,its all psychological.Im also sure that I'm not asexual since I do feel all that attraction outside of those phases.I have tried researching my symptoms but I've never really found anything that would match,and it's just really worrying me and I dont even know if its abnormal or  just a normal part of puberty.I also marked it NSFW just to be sure.",
    "So I’ve noticed that viewer ship is all over the place depending on when I post or what I post. I just recently had posts get around 5000-54000 views. I posted again earlier in the morning and only got about 14 views. I’m wondering if when I posts effects my views as much as even the content I’m posting. I’ve also noticed people don’t really want to know about my life they would rather watch me do impulsive things that they more or less want to do but can’t go through with like dying my hair or making things that the audiences hobbies coincide with. The steps of getting viewer ship seems very difficult but also all over the place. Some people use hashtags some don’t but still get 1000’s of views. What constitutes as the perfect time, the perfect description with hashtags or even the best content for your demographic? I’ve definitely improved my viewership since the vine era but it’s all really an equation of when and what. At some point I’m really hoping to find what it is my followers or new viewers exactly want to see but until then I am still figuring it out. Has anyone noticed what seems the best time to post or even the best hashtags to use? What content seems to do better for newer users to help boost their platforms? Maybe some people could take a look at my platform and critique what I post so I can improve. tiktok: ",
    "I was talking with my therapist today about all of the judgements my JNMIL has about me.  We talked about how a lot of these judgements are at odds with one another and don’t make sense.   For example, following my DD’s birth she complained that I contribute nothing to my marriage or our finances, despite the fact that DH and I both work successful high paying jobs where I frequently earn more than him.   Then when i returned to work, she accused me of not caring about my DD’s wellbeing and being an awful mom. Despite knowing that these ideas literally don’t make sense when taken together, I still can’t help but let her get in my head.  My therapist asked why I thought that was and truly I can’t answer.  I’m curious, why do your MILs words/judgements bring you down?",
    "Reading a translation of Anabasis, I noticed that having escaped the Army of Artaxerxes, and made it through the Armenian mountain passes, the Ten Thousand encounter a reoccurring trope amongst the various Pontic peoples they encounter. There are multiple instances where the local villages flee their homes in the face of the oncoming army, and hole up in Strongholds/Citadels. From the book, it is my understanding that these are not populated settlements and are only occupied to wait out hostile forces. It also seems that they were built collectively between multiple villages rather than each village having its own small strong-point. What other sources, if any, reference this practice? Is there any evidence for these small strongholds? In the book, they are often taken by the greeks without a prolonged siege or any equipment so how sophisticated could they have been?",

    "After reading some of the reviews that trash this film I had to speak up.<br/><br/>This film is gritty and dirty. There is content which is not pleasant, swearing and violence amounts other things. What else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? Well more than that actually, it about choices and what you Choose! Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did. At no point did it ever say \"Look at this, its cool.\" For those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in Britain, not just Scotland. I being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.<br/><br/>That being said, those things do not take anything away from the film, the quality of plot and story, or the acting which is Stunning! Robert Carlise as Begbe was excellent, and Ewan MacGregor shined. Also the character Spud was worth a mention he really was quite good.<br/><br/>This film is in my Opinion a work of Genius, that represents the book accurately.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.",
    "Why the poor box office performance?  Why the bad reviews?  Why the bad word of mouth?  I really didn't see anything horrible about this movie!  First of all, it's a character-driven story.  There's little subplots involving jealousy and philandering, but it's not handled in a soapy fashion.  I didn't feel any of the characters were one-dimensional.<br/><br/>\nOf course, Mike Myers steals the show as the homosexual club owner Steve Rubell.  I don't know the real Steve Rubell, so you be the judge whether or not his performance was accurate, but I have to say that Myers did an incredible job!  And I'm not overstating the least bit!  You watch him in this movie and you totally forget that this is the same guy who played Austin Powers.  Not to say I didn't realize Myers had talent prior to watching this film.  He has definitely proven that he has talent as a comic actor, but I didn't know he had the chops to pull off a straight, dramatic role.  Even his accent sounds real, not the least bit phony.  I'm surprised Myers didn't even get an Oscar nod.  He should've at least gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Trust me--you will be blown away by his performance in this movie!<br/><br/>The music is great.  It's always great to reminisce to the great songs from the seventies.  Mark  Christopher nicely captured the whole rebellious atmosphere of 54.  We're given a taste of the drug addiction and even the sexual promiscuity that made the place famous--there's a scene where a couple shamelessly pounds away on the balcony.  I read one person's review, saying that this movie should've been an hour longer.  I find it ironic that people watch movies that are two and a half to three hours long and complain, \"Oh, this movie dragged!  Oh, this movie needed more editing!\" Yet they watch a succintly timed film like this and complain it's too short. This may not have been the most thorough examination of the famous nightclub, but I think it got to the point.  No reason why we have to go into every tiny detail.<br/><br/>This is a serious, dramatic film but it's also very entertaining.  I actually had a smile on my face when the movie ended.  It ended on a happy note without having that forced, schmaltzy Hollywood feel.  Plus, I really like that song \"Knock on Wood\" that they played over the credits.<br/><br/>\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",
    "The Silence of the Lambs is a timeless classic, whose more than adequate storytelling never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most entertaining but least fun films to watch all because of its disturbingly genius atmosphere.\nIt's masterfully acted, especially from Hopkins's side turning this film into a clever and unforgettable masterpiece. Even though Hopkins and Foster don't have much screentime together they still put on a show to remember. Aside from top of the line acting and the directing the script from Ted Tally's (based on the novel by Thomas Harris) is career-defining. From thriller to psychological horror, this movie handles the tone and atmosphere perfectly while switching between the two. In terms of being a psychological horror movie, it does it perfecting as it wraps itself around the viewers' head and proves that gore and blood aren't needed to scare an audience. Surprisingly (and deservedly) this film swooped all five major Oscar categories (Best actor, actress, director, screenplay and picture) even though it was released in February, a whole year before the academy awards.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable feat in film making and you be seen by everyone, a film lover or not. Shocking and suspenseful it is a thrill to behold.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10",
    "The best film in the era of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Supremely well acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize.

Realmete with this film you can compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly.",
    "I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.<br/><br/>\nIt is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. <br/><br/>As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see \"Hart's War\" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).<br/><br/>All in all, \"The Great Escape\" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",
    "Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel \"Hearts of darkness\" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.<br/><br/>The film has a simple premise, US Army Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into Cambodia through a river, to assassinate a renegade, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. It's an accessible premise, allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers, and yet this film is anything but shallow. It's a journey into madness and hysteria, an observation into the darkness of humanity. I could write a book analyzing this film, there's just so much to talk about. My interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find Kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character's inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie, dehumanization. The journey through the river is also reminiscent of Dante's perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. There are three major stops before Kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought, as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.<br/><br/>The first stop is with lieutenant Kilgore. That stop shows that Kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. Their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can't comprehend the consequences the war will bring. In one scene of the movie, the \"heroic\" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies, Captain Kilgore uses Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures Valkyries, he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. At this stage, although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy, they still understand the innocent.<br/><br/>The second stop is the USO show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. At this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself, becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. The soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. Now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.\nThe last stop before Kurtz is the Do-long Bridge and it's at this point that a soldier has gone too far, he's experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can't return to a normal state of mind.<br/><br/>The final stop on the journey is Kurtz, at this point only Willard and Kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness, the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. Kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. Bypassing the madness stage he's able to see the world for what it truly is, filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. Willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. He kills Kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. In the end Willard has a choice, succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken Kurtz's place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon, he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving Lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe, he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. Both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn't, they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.<br/><br/>The film presents this study of the human psyche through Carmine Coppola's eerie score, hypnotic images, and some haunting scenes, essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. It's here where Coppola succeeds the most. His ability to create a living \"hell\" is so amazing, and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. It provides a commentary on war and religion, making the subtext even vaster. The film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film's runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat, and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner, conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer's breath away. Coppola's direction transcends itself, the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows, most notable during Col. Kurtz's first appearance. The troubled production obviously didn't hurt the film at all, and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. Apocalypse Now is beautifully haunting, utterly hellish, terrifyingly intelligent, and magnificently wrought, it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war, but also its meaningfulness and beauty. Not only is this one of the best films ever made, it's a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. It is Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. Rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon, immortal for its contribution to cinema, and a truly unforgettable experience, Apocalypse Now is cinema at its most complete, crystalline and pure.",
    "After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions, ridiculous CG-assisted stunts and mindless action, I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better. <br/><br/>The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle. <br/><br/>De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots, but all are carefully tied into the through-line of the story to match the main character's progression. <br/><br/>The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story, The Bay of Pigs debacle, and traces the steps that lead to it, one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character, Edward Wilson, barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did (the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wire-rimmed or horn-rimmed glasses), but it didn't ruin the film for me. <br/><br/>Overall though, definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand, rather than forget.",
    "Well I guess it's official, I'm eating my words as we speak. Yeah, I'm the guy who doesn't like sequels and yet here I am giving positive ratings to Star Trek Into Darkness and now The Hangover Part III. It's scary to think of what I might do next. If the new Fast and the Furious movie impresses me, I guess I'll just skip reviewing it and go straight into denial. But seriously folks, I went into the new Hangover with really low expectations. We're talking bottom feeder if you know what I mean. So from now on I think that's the key. I'm going to take this approach with every film I see. That way I'll stroll out of the theater as a movie critic that raves about everything and comes off as not so darn grumpy. Whoa, forget what I just said. I was merely kidding people!<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what occurs in part III. At the very beginning, we find mentally unstable \"wolfpack\" member Alan (Zach Galifianakis getting the most exposure he's had in any of the Hangover films) buying a giraffe, putting it in the back of his truck, and killing it on the freeway (I'm thinking you know how it happened). Upon doing this, he irritates his family and draws concern from the other \"wolfpack\" members (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha). Everyone but Alan, stages an intervention on his behalf to get him to a treatment center somewhere in Arizona. He'll agree to go if his three buds will drive him there. As the four of them set out on a moderately short road trip, their car is rammed off the road, they are dragged out of it (held at gunpoint mind you), and one of the crew (Bartha of course) is taken hostage. This sets off a chain of events which leads everybody to venture back to good old Sin City.<br/><br/>Well let's get down to it. Right off the bat I want to let you know why I liked The Hangover Part III. I enjoyed it for the exact reason that some critics panned it. This flick doesn't try to be like the other two in the trilogy. In fact, it feels like a totally different animal all together. Yes there is a dash of the funny (something part I did effortlessly and part II attempted miserably), but there's also a hint of darkness that comes close to turning everything into a sort of black comedy with shards of mild violence. For me, this is an effective way to wrap things up (unless there is a part IV of course). You can tell that the director (Todd Phillips) wanted to avoid copping out and injected part III with a little more juice (this is the other reason I liked it and most critics didn't. They think Phillips went way over the top or felt he had to prove something). He did the film justice by avoiding the same tired plot line (everyone gets smashed and wakes up not knowing what the heck just happened) while making an effort to tie together loose ends from the other two movies (by way of flashbacks). This is done to effect in the first 15 minutes and it sets everything in motion.<br/><br/>The actors then promptly assume their personalities from the first two installments. Doug Billings who's never around for the debauchery, plays the happily married nice guy. Alan, plays the screw loose, borderline mental patient who nonchalantly goes about his business. Phil, is the smug, unhappily married school teacher who is calm under pressure, and Stu is the manic anxiety ridden dentist who thinks all hope is gone. Together they fit their roles like comfortable old shoes. Overall their performances are manically unhinged. You get what's required of them coupled with a fresher more potently nasty script this time around (part II's had lazy written all over it).<br/><br/>As far as supporting work goes, I thought John Goodman (gangster Marshall) was a nice little addition to the Hangover family (he riffs off his Big Lebowski character but just not quite as intense). I also like the addition of a love interest for Alan (someone besides man crush Phil) in Melissa McCarthy. She seems to make a cameo in everything these days and certainly is a hoot as a pawn shop owner who candidly berates her wheelchair confined mother.<br/><br/>The only setback for this Hangover is the blatant deviation from the focus of the four stars of the movie (the infamous \"wolfpack\"). This exercise is bent on giving two supporting characters their own vehicle (Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Galifianakis). True these guys are funny and steal many a scene, but the other members of the cast don't get a lot of room to breathe. They get kind of pushed to the side and become sort of frowned upon (Bradley Cooper recently got nominated for an Oscar, give him some props for gosh sakes). And what's with always having Justin Bartha's character not present with the other members of the \"pack\" when the madness of their misadventures is going down. It seems predetermined and silly. What, is he not good enough an actor to occupy some precious screen time with his buddies (Bartha was in the colossal flop Gigli (2003) so maybe that's it, who knows).<br/><br/>When it all comes down to it, I found myself at ease with the way part III whisked by. It's darker than the first one, funnier than the second one, and more daring than both of them. I laughed, I winced, and felt confident in recommending this hot mess of a movie. It's a sequel all right, but it tries really hard not to be one. I admire that. With nothing to lose, you should go check out The Hangover part III. It's a solid time killer and a required \"hair of the dog\" if you will.",
    "As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.<br/><br/>However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.<br/><br/>For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).<br/><br/>The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.<br/><br/>What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.",
    "I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as \"one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles\" and \"one of the classics of the 70's\". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a \"crazy house\" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.<br/><br/>What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.<br/><br/>-10/10",
    "I am an engineer working offshore in North Sea. I have seen the movie this evening in UK. Is really a good movie, congratulations to all involved you done a great job showing a little bit of ''life in offshore rig''. Looks like in this movie is BP fault but in real world at the rig site everyone has the right to STOP THE JOB if something is wrong or something is going on against the procedures. I have work before in BP rigs in North Sea and I stop the job when I wasn't happy with what is going on I had all the support from the Service Company that I am working for and also BP company understood my concerns. If you are a engineer, roughneck, derrick-man or whatever you are at Rig Site if you think that something is going wrong and against the procedures STOP THE JOB. I do it and I will do again better to lose my job than to see people dying.(Thanks for reading my review)",
    "Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.<br/><br/>Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.<br/><br/>Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.<br/><br/>I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.<br/><br/>I hope my talk helps.",
    "My name is Cecilia and being from Manila this film is very personal to me because my grandfather sacrificed his life during WWII. According to eyewitness accounts, he was tied to a post, doused with kerosene and set on fire. I am watching this film to somehow pay tribute to him and those who selflessly gave up their lives to ensure a free and humane future for all of us. I felt though that the film underestimated what we Filipinos really went through during the war. It would have been just to include the other atrocities perpetuated by the Japanese: babies thrown in the air and caught with bayonets, women brutally raped and breasts carved out, or the massacre of approximately 100,000 unarmed and innocent civilians during the battle for the liberation of Manila on the first days of February 1945. Nevertheless, I am grateful for director John Dahl for shedding light on a chapter in our history that many people hardly know about , specially the present generation, The Bataan Death March.",
    "After watching this movie I can say that no it is not as good as the original but that does mean that it is a bad movie. What I was really excited to see in this movie from the trailers was the scares and the demon nun Valak. The movie does not disappoint and can't wait to see the next entry in the conjuring series!",
    "`The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped, bound and gagged, into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most, if not all, of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet, Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving indifference, to be a criminal-type with a heart of gold, and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline, which exists merely as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed, well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright, sparkling sheen.   In fact, Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham, who makes for a very `cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",
    "Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!",
    "8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.<br/><br/>The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.<br/><br/>The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the \"Free World,\" are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.<br/><br/>Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.<br/><br/>All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.",
    "Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney.  That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist.  He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br/><br/>But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.  Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself.  Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!  Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.",
    "Dawn of the Dead<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.<br/><br/>And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>Grade: A-",
    "This film will generate anger because it throws a \"deadpan\" brick directly towards cultural dysfunction and mass delusion. \"War Machine,\" and Brad Pitt, even exceeded the deadpan message of \"Being There\" a film from a less cynical time in history but still relevant to this day. <br/><br/>\"War Machine\" does a great job illustrating how disconnected the every-man has become in relation to reality. We live in a time where facts are now selectively chosen to support forgone perspectives rather than being absolute, universal, and irrefutable. <br/><br/>We live in a time where personage, perceptions, and public relations matter more than overview, objectives, conclusions, and endpoints. Reality has been set adrift. <br/><br/>It was a brave thing to produce this film because it speaks to a very narrow audience. Most people won't be entertained by the communication mechanism (deadpan) nor will the understand the message. Few people will be open to perspectives other than those which are preconceived. Some people are not aware and thus cannot acknowledge the wounds and damage that political lies have done to the American process and psyche. <br/><br/>To conclude our failed state of affairs, the affairs of a failed nation state (our nation state) I am not with him because he is certainly not with me no matter how much he tells me otherwise. The cohesion of leadership, truth, and the American way has left the building.<br/><br/>It is more of a shame that people won't understand this film, or won't want to. And that is how far we have fallen. Perhaps Rome fell the same way on the sword and misadventure of its own lies and delusion.",
    "\"The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived, without wealth, without property, without official title or office.  Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies, nor the ruler of vast lands.  He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift.  Yet men, governments, dignitaries from all over the world, have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth, who led his country to freedom.\"<br/><br/>This quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film \"Gandhi\".  Richard Attenborough directed this massive epic about the man that freed India. The film opens with Gandhi's assassination.  The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi's funeral on January 31st, 1981, the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral.  It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation. This film was made before CGI (computer generated images), so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed.<br/><br/>\nMahatma Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art.  This film has made and will make millions of people aware of the little brown man that took on the British Empire and won.  \"Gandhi\" serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history.<br/><br/>\nBen Kingsley played Gandhi.  He was the perfect for the role.  He resembled the real Gandhi.  He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man. He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.   He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part. And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the \"big-time actor\" persona did not get in the way of viewing the film.  He did win both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor, for this role, which I agree he deserved.  He became Gandhi.<br/><br/>The cinematography was outstanding.  Attenborough filmed \"Gandhi\" on location in India.  The scenes of India are spectacular, and India is very much another character in the film.  This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi.  Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta.  It is suggested by Kingsley, on the DVD, that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming.  They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman.  Undeterred by their negative thinking, he persevered to enlist thousands of Indians to help make this film.  Every crowd scene, he used real Indians from the area. Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for everyone.  It should be required viewing in high schools, as part of History class.  The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant.  It is also a beautiful work of art.  This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood (see \"Pearl Harbor\" for that). Of course, it would have been hard to screw up a movie about such a great man. 10/10",
    "I walked into the movie theater expecting to see Adam Sandler make a complete buffoon of himself. However, when I came out I was impressed. There was a depth to this movie I did not see coming, and it took me completely off guard. \"Click\" proved to be a powerful, emotional, and humorous piece of work. There was a certain philosophical message in this movie, in which I think, we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work-aholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie, and in \"Click\" he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh. Definitely a 10/10 in my book.",
    "It's hard to say if is an improvement or not on the original, but it's certainly a good continuation of the story this time more focused on Alex's origin and life.

    "There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.<br/><br/>The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.<br/><br/>You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless. <br/><br/>The King's Speech boasts an exceptional cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.<br/><br/>The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year.",
    "I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.<br/><br/>10/10 Highly Recommended",
    "I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.<br/><br/>'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx (all good actresses) could respectively bring out the sweetness, vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy, humour, liveliness, enthusiasm and devotion (towards family) of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.<br/><br/>In addition, the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laugh-out-loud Bonnie Hunt, a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston, a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki (one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves)'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating oh-look-I'm-so-cute child models.<br/><br/>The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio, switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side, the wild and smooth cinematography, slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.<br/><br/>The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well, actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story.",
    "This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",
    "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. <br/><br/>This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. <br/><br/>The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. <br/><br/>The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. <br/><br/>I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.",
    "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.<br/><br/>But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.<br/><br/>I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date.",
    "When I see films like this, it really underlines the programmed ignorance of most Americans, and just how effective the government and the media are at shaping a false narrative. Al Qaeda was never an existential threat to America, and the Taliban was an internecine problem only to local Afghans and different Islamic sects. The conflict and motivation set up in this film is just ludicrous and phony. I am retired US Army, I still have contacts in the service who know the truth about Afghanistan. This film is a sham.",
    "Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for \"Airplane\", \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\", and the \"Naked Gun\" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody! <br/><br/>I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the \"Hotel Gay Schluffen\", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.<br/><br/>I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him afterwards!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If \"Top Secret!\" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means \"She whose bosoms defy gravity\"?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)<br/><br/>The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.<br/><br/>It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, but there's no doubt about it, \"Top Secret!\" IS one of the great comedies of our time.",
    "Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. \"When you re-write a script it gets better and better\" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like \"Nick of Time\" \"The Astronaut's Wife\" and \"Secret Window\" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a \"safe\", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!",
    "Heartbreaking yet captivating, Changeling's story was fascinating all the way through, even if the first half was a little slow. It certainly was a compelling story, shot beautifully, and written well. Angelina Jolie gave a mesmerizing performance as grief stricken Christine Collins, as well as the many young actors in the film. It's certainly worth the time.",
    "In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends because he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it was free, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.",
    "For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the characters in the movie. Sorry for those who's lives were so well protected that they've never been exposed to the likes of us but, that's how we talk and act. It's a type-A environment and we use it to protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.<br/><br/>I am well versed on the facts as provided by the MSM however, as someone in the biz I also know that the fly in the ointment are the facts.<br/><br/>1. The firing of mortars is an art and the mortar launcher has to be anchored to the ground or every mortar will land off target. The mortars landing on the CIA compound are dead accurate and also require spotters to assist with any corrections.<br/><br/>2. Aviano AB, Italy is about 2-hours away. Had they been launched, even if only to do a low fly-by, would have driven off the attackers; just like I used them in Iraq in Mosul, Tikrit, and Baghdad. I don't know why the Commander of the 555 (Triple Nickel) didn't launch. It's one of the big questions that remain unanswered by the media or the movie.<br/><br/>3. Hillary's statement that, \"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?\" was a red herring. Because it was neither. As later testimony bore out, it was a planned, coordinated, terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11.<br/><br/>4. All UAS aircraft are armed.

    "In the midst of the many wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick, it is strange to note how rarely people mention \"Barry Lyndon\".<br/><br/>The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.<br/><br/>Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in \"Barry Lyndon\" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.<br/><br/>The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.<br/><br/>\"Barry Lyndon is\", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them! KimotoCat",
    "It is too unbelievable and too lame. It is unfunny and like a cartoon that is on film.\nExaggeration is OK when it is interesting not when it is a spoof that takes itself seriously.",
    "When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.<br/><br/>Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots. <br/><br/>I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish \"whodunit\" as well. <br/><br/>Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as \"Del Spooner\", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in \"Enemy of the State\" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, \"Independence Day\" and \"Men in Black\". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.<br/><br/>A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. <br/><br/>The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a \"good guy\" or not. <br/><br/>This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.<br/><br/>Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the \"camera moving with moving object\" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment. <br/><br/>In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. <br/><br/>Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that \"I, Robot\" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.<br/><br/>Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie, any movie that gives you fun, drama, action, mystery, and makes you think is a great movie. Thank goodness I, Robot is all of the above.",
    "Being German I'm not really into the Hooligan way of life. I'm just fond of the Brit way of making films and this one is just brilliant. Of course you can argue about whether the director Nick Love is showing the life of some football thugs too positive and without the \"never do this, kids\" attitude, but...this is just a great piece of film. It has terrific acting (especially Frank Harper does a great job), splendid camera and editing and a more than suiting soundtrack. Watched it with some pals and it was just great fun. The scene where Rod tells his girlfriend's parents about his inner thoughts is a highlight. So if you're able to shut out all thoughts of moral and you're just interested in 90 minutes of quality film-making of today...watch this. It's definitely all worth it!",
    "A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Helen Mirren works a miracle with her characterization. When the Queen is forced by circumstances to address her people and mourn in public Diana's death, Helen Mirren doesn't forget that her character is a seasoned public speaker but not an actress. When she delivers her speech to her subjects, the real strength is in her commitment to her duty and not the meaning of her words. It is a chilling, masterful acting stroke. Stephen Frears uses the brilliantly structured script to reveal something that's always being in front of our eyes but we've never seen. The privacy of the most public people in the world. Michael Sheen is terrific as Blair and every piece of casting is truly inspired but it's Helen Mirren's film, oh yeah, one hundred per cent.",
    "Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.<br/><br/>The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous \"blondes\"), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.<br/><br/>\"To reveal more,\" as Leonard Maltin wrote, \"would be unthinkable.\"<br/><br/>While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!<br/><br/>One of the all-time greats. They definitely don't make them like this anymore.",
    "What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!<br/><br/>BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.<br/><br/>Go see this movie!",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "This of course is not a great movie but I just have to give it a 10/10. I have never laughed more in my life. Even the jokes that aren't funny are funny. This film's comedic build up is about the best you will ever see. It doesn't even matter what the punch line is, its how they get to it thats hilarious.<br/><br/>Now this cast was perfect. Anytime you have Randy Quaid in a film you just know the film is going to make you life just by looking at him. Kingpin couldn't have shown this any better as he plays an Amish man who just happens to be amazingly talented at bowling. Woody Harrelson plays a has-been ex-professional bowler who makes a comeback with managing through Randy Quaid. Together they go on a ride across the country making money left and right. Along the journey they are great supporting comedic performances given by Bill Murray and Vanessa Angel who certainly makes the look of the film more appealing.<br/><br/>The Farrelly brothers in my opinion give their best direction they've yet to have. Yet it is the writers who so perfectly set up one joke after another. It seems as if the script is so sharp that their are jokes within jokes. The Farrelly brother handle this material so well by virtual unknowns.<br/><br/>As I have said before this is not a great film but I would highly recommend this if your in the mood of watching something spontaneous. It may not be the most technically sound movie ever made or the deepest but I have never laughed so much in life and that in it self is what comedies are about.",
    "Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with Bill Murray losing his job, girlfriend, and apartment, all in the same day. He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups, exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, \"I think your ready for the Special Olympics!\" Harold also shines in a bit-part in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand, \"You speak some English?\" The student answers back \"SOB and $hit\" and the whole class than repeats it.<br/><br/>The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy joins the fun as likable, lovable \"Ox.\" There are the typical sex gags, simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.<br/><br/>After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine, having silly one-lines like, \"Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do.\" rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe, the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.",
    "I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\".",
    "Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****<br/><br/>What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.<br/><br/>In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. <br/><br/>Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. <br/><br/>Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. <br/><br/>We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. <br/><br/>These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. <br/><br/>Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. <br/><br/>Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>4/4",
    "Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.<br/><br/>Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.<br/><br/>Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.<br/><br/>The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!<br/><br/>This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.<br/><br/>PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive.",
    "The Auteurist Perspective - The most unorthodox way of viewing this picture is as a kind of formalist exercise. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has talked about his desire to make a film tailored exactly to the format of a Hollywood action movie, even going so far as to count the number of cuts and camera set-ups in the blockbusters he watched for research. Everything in the movie may be taking place within quotation marks, as in the melodramas of Douglas Sirk or, more obliquely, Gus van Sant's 'Psycho'. The film wants to be both an archetypal big sci-fi action movie whilst simultaneously a pastiche of the form. The gorgeously overblown shot of Ripley and Call standing amid the clouds at the film's close certainly suggests a playful tweaking of blockbuster bombast. However, the 'Alien' series may not be the most appropriate place for this experiment; the series is far more defined by spaces and silences than by frenetic action of the Bruckheimer variety. Even James Cameron's 'Aliens' is surprisingly slow in its build-up; by contrast, Resurrection's relentless pace becomes oddly monotonous and the film loses the distinctive texture Jeunet brings to it.<br/><br/>The Whedonite Perspective - The problems with the script are mostly additions or changes to Joss Whedon's original (which is available online). Whedon rightly made Ripley's resurrection the backbone for the story, finding new things to do with a character many believed had reached the end of her life, both literally and creatively. He also carefully fleshed out the supporting characters just enough to keep them interesting. There are small problems even in his original script - Purviss is sidelined when his predicament demands imaginative exploration, and the narrative is more linear than you'd expect from this writer. But it's the feeble alterations that damage the film - reducing characters like Hillard (in particular) to cyphers, changing the ending so the audience never gets to see earth (the only place, as Whedon instinctively understood, that the climax could possibly take place), and removing a lot of the texture of the setting, like the marijuana fields. 'I'm a stranger here myself' should have been one of the great closing lines in movie history, up there with 'Tomorrow is another day' and 'Shut up and deal', but the dialogue (Whedon's great strength) is mangled by a director working in his second language, and who seems to be paying more attention to the lighting anyway.<br/><br/>The Cynical Perspective - The 'Alien' series is, by this point, a cash cow that everyone involved wants to milk until it bleeds. 'Alien3' ended Ripley's story with an unflinching finality that 'Resurrection' can only cheapen, no matter how good it is. The hiring of a cult french director is a sop to the critics who lionise Scott and Fincher's contributions - and whilst prior instalments were filmed in England, this production was mounted in LA, for the convenience of everyone involved. It wouldn't do to make too much of an effort on what is, after all, the latest sausage on the string. The suits' only concern is the opening weekend; hence Winona, shoehorned in just in case Sigourney's box office draw is waning.<br/><br/>The Aesthetic Perspective - John Frizzell's score is the fourth classic in a row for the series; both lushly romantic and queasily menacing, it gives the film its own distinctive flavour. The production design is bold and distinctive, with perhaps a hint of playful parody (the sickly green light, the mad scientist outfits, the giant glass jars in the lab); the film looks like a comic strip version of its predecessors. Some of the direction is highly effective - the underwater sequence is devastatingly beautiful. The problem is the slightly over-ripe grotesquerie Jeunet brings out in the material, particularly in the way the cast is shot (Dominique Pinon looks like a malevolent garden gnome, Dan Hedaya resembles a sweaty gendarme). It sits uneasily with the straightforward disaster movie plot. The biggest miscalculation on the production front, however, is the Newborn. The thinking behind it - to give it an expressive face and thus complicate Ripley's (and our) emotional response to it - is sound enough, but it doesn't really come off in the finished creature, which looks like moldy old tissues clinging to a pipe-cleaner frame. Whedon's original conception of a white, red-veined alien of the traditional design might have worked more effectively, although even that might not have survived the aesthetic indignity of its impossible demise, getting sucked into space as a string of alien linguine.",
    "I've been slowly making my way through Guillermo del Toro's catalogue of movies and this is my first time watching Hell Boy. If you're a Del Toro fan, then this one won't disappoint. He's such a superior director - he adds artistry to this action film through his use of shot making, pacing and colour. At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself.",
    "George : Hey guys, remember that movie we all did a few years back called Ocean's Eleven?<br/><br/>Brad : Course we do, we had such a great time.<br/><br/>Julia : And let's not forget we made stacks of money on it. It was a hit!<br/><br/>George : Well here's an idea.Let's make a sequel!<br/><br/>Matt : Fantastic idea! I mean the first one had all of us in it but most of all it was directed, had cool music, had lots of us in it and had a great script.<br/><br/>Brad : The script? Oh yeah, the script, whatever.<br/><br/>Julia : Let's do it. Everyone will love seeing us mugging it up on the screen. Steven Soderbergh's a friend of mine so he'll love directing us again.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, he'll do it. He won't have to work too hard though because it's got us in it. In fact he can just stuff around and experiment with all sorts of stupid camera angles.<br/><br/>Matt : Won't that just confuse the audience and make them dizzy?<br/><br/>George : Stuff that! Just so long as everyone can make out it's us up there on the screen they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : And the music??<br/><br/>Brad : Pfft! Music? No one goes to the movies for music. They want to see stars. Like us! Let's just have any old stupid music for this one.<br/><br/>Matt : That's fine. What about the script?<br/><br/>Brad : What is it with you and the script? Hey here's an idea. Julia, you're so famous and wonderful<br/><br/>Julia : So are you Brad.<br/><br/>Brad : Thanks Julia. What I was saying was how about we have an entire sequence where your character pretends to be you! Everyone knows you're fantastic so they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great idea Brad. How do we fit that into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Julia! Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK. How about we get someone else as famous and wonderful as us to join in the cast? The audience will love that.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, let's get Bruce Willis in a pointless uncredited cameo. He's never been too fussy about what movies he's made before. He's bound to say yes.<br/><br/>Matt : How do we fit him into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Bruce Willis. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK, who else?<br/><br/>Brad : I'm way ahead of you here, Julia. I've got a famous wife so let's get someone who is famous and wonderful, with a famous husband and who they audience will love if they see her and I having a romantic scene.<br/><br/>All : Catherine Zeta Jones!<br/><br/>George : I'll call her and see. <br/><br/>(Ring Ring)<br/><br/>Catherine : Hello. George : Hi Catherine, George Clooney here. You might remember working with me in Intolerable Crueltythe audience loved it!<br/><br/>Catherine : Hi George. What's up?<br/><br/>George : We're making a sequel to Ocean's Eleven. It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt in it. How'd you like to be in it too?<br/><br/>Catherine : Yeah sure. What's it about?<br/><br/>George : Who cares?? It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt and you in it!!<br/><br/>Catherine : OK. But how about we film it in Europe? The audience will love that!<br/><br/>George : It's a deal. See ya.<br/><br/>Catherine : Bye<br/><br/>Julia : So how'd it go?<br/><br/>George : She's in AND she had a great idea. She reckons we could film it somewhere in Europe.<br/><br/>Brad : Fantastic!<br/><br/>Matt : So how does that fit into the script?<br/><br/>Julia : Who cares about the script!! It's got us in it! And anyone who liked Ocean's Eleven will get sucked into seeing it and by then it's too late for them to worry about the script because they've already paid their money.<br/><br/>George : And besides they'll love it because it's got me and Julia and Matt and Brad AND Catherine in it AND it will be filmed in Europe. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great. Let's do it!!<br/><br/>you get the idea.",
    "I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original – just: Wow!<br/><br/>It's clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the 'office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) – this movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for film geeks like me.

    "So once again, after the debacle of Prometheus, Ridley Scott has proved himself simultaneously a master of visuals and yet utterly incompetent when it comes to creating a believable Alien story.<br/><br/>The single biggest problem I had with Prometheus was the collection of imbeciles and weirdos that made up the crew, and one might have hoped that Mr Scott would have realised that himself and made amends this time round. Errr.... no, sadly not. Once again we're treated to a crew of simpletons who make THE MOST pathetic and unbelievable decisions possible. Are we really supposed to believe that a crew would just ditch it's primary mission (that we're told had been over 10 years in the planning to ensure their destination was safe, etc) just because they happened to stumble on a new planet purely by chance? Just plain ludicrous. And that's just the start. A few more examples :<br/><br/><ul><li>Assuming we suspend our disbelief and accept the whole \"let's risk all the colonists and everything we have planned for decades for to land on this new unknown planet instead\" premise, why do these alleged scientists once again TOTALLY disregard the need for any protective clothing? So no breathing equipment, nothing at all to protect them from any alien pathogens. Good thinking!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Faced with a choice of sending either an android, or pretty much the entire human crew with no protective gear, to investigate an alien world, who should go? Yeah that's right, send all the unprotected humans!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Choice of landing right near the source of the unknown signal, or land several miles away and in a foot of water despite there being solid and flat ground a few feet away? Yep, it's wet feet and a huge hike all round folks!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Little alien pods on this alien world puffing their alien spores into the air? Sure, just get your nose in there and have a good sniff. I'm sure it'll be fine!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crewmen get infected by said spores? Don't worry about any quarantine procedures, just carry them back to the ship while getting covered in their vomited-up blood.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alien organism just burst out of said infected crewman? Just open up the locked door and try to shoot it, but be careful you don't miss at point blank range and then slip up on the blood.... twice. (When that happened, people actually laughed in the cinema. I was half expecting a comedy sound effect the second time!)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tens of thousands of dead bodies, and an enormous dead city solely inhabited by David the android from the Prometheus mission, that the planetary scan managed to NOT pick up from orbit when determining the planet to be \"safe\"? No need to ask David what happened, just accept that it's all fine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dark basements to go into all on your own? Do it! Nothing bad will happen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Huge alien eggs opening in front of you? Just have a good look inside. What could possibly go wrong?!</li></ul><br/><br/>The list of stupid decisions just goes on and on AND ON!<br/><br/>While visually the film is generally excellent, the all-CGI-Alien was a huge let-down. Personally I found it considerably less convincing than the practical effects used in Alien and Aliens, which is unforgivable considering the creature is what these films are all about!<br/><br/>Additionally the crew, apart from being imbeciles (as is usual under Mr Scott's direction these days), are also completely forgettable. I saw this movie last night and I can't remember a single character's name today. The one exception is David/Walter, and once again Fassbender does a great job. (Perhaps that's why there's two of them - to make up for a lack of any other decent characters).<br/><br/>The other problem narrative-wise is that both Prometheus and Covenant have actually served to make the Alien universe much SMALLER in my opinion. In the original Alien and Aliens, the creature was just an unknown organism from the far reaches of the universe, and all the more scary because of it. (The same went for the Space Jockey for that matter). But these new movies have tried to tie it all back to humanity in some way - i.e. the Engineers (who are also the Space Jockeys) created both humanity and the black oil virus, and then the Xenomorph was apparently created by David (who was in turn created by man) somehow doing some genetic tinkering with the black oil and human DNA, while living in a cave and playing with his flute. Far from expanding the Alien universe, both these prequels have actually shrunk it by making man the centre of everything, while at the same time managing to sanitise and neuter one of the greatest movie creatures of all time. So what Ridley Scott is saying is that the entire Alien series and the iconic Xenomorph itself was just created by a deranged android with God/daddy issues. How very pathetic and disappointing. I personally hate it when movies try to explain everything to the millionth degree because it invariably ends up as a massive anticlimax. What was wrong with the Xenomorph just being some hideous unknown life-form from the far reaches of space???<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but there's a word limit here.<br/><br/>Lastly, the end is just pretty feeble and anticlimactic. The CG- Alien just kind of gets killed and that's it. And the *ahem* \"twist\" with David/Walter could be seen from a mile away, although David wouldn't have had anywhere near enough time to cut his own arm off and change his clothes and hairstyle.<br/><br/>Please PLEASE Mr Scott, stand aside and let Neill Blomkamp have his shot at an Aliens sequel.<br/><br/>A generous 2 Stars. One for the visuals that are once again gorgeous, and one for a great effort from Fassbender.",
    "Spectre was a classy action movie....making the expected James Bond signatures always look new. loved the suave and class of our favourite British spy. Daniel Craig just re-immersed us in giving us another classic to relish for years.",
    "I'll be honest, I don't think any of the reviewers that have given this movie 10 stars have seen any episodes of the show pre-2000.<br/><br/>I went into the movie thinking it would probably be decent. I figured it would probably be in the style of the newer episodes but with better overall material. That's pretty much how it turned out. Anyone who says it was a return to the older *better* Simpsons is kidding themselves.<br/><br/>The Simpsons greatness was based, in my opinion, on two things: characters that we imagine existing in our society (think the comic book guy, Moe, Flanders) and simply hilarious and very quotable lines. This formula has since been replaced by humor that is situationally based, and quite frankly, just not very funny.<br/><br/>I saw this movie yesterday afternoon, and I can hardly think of one line that had me cracking up. There were some funny moments, yes, but nothing comparable to the brilliant one-liners from the show's glory years.",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in \"Mrs Brown\". \"The Young Victoria\" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.<br/><br/>There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.<br/><br/>Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.<br/><br/>Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford's attempt on Victoria's life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria's accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a \"Regency Order\"; the Duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.<br/><br/>There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a \"Danger! Major cliché ahead!\" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in \"Moulin Rouge\").<br/><br/>The main reason for the film's success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make \"The Young Victoria\" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10",
    "While watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of films and TV shows from my youth, first was any of the original Godzilla films, the second, a TV show Ultra Man. The FX were way better here, but, it just made me think of them. I found the film entertaining, no Oscar winner, but, it was good. Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of course, rooting for the good guys.<br/><br/>I also had to think that mankind would have or could have thought of a better defense/offense weapon than giant robots. To bring a fight into the city would have cost trillions of dollars, perhaps Quadrillions of dollars. Okay, I'm reading way to much into it. Watch the movie, you will enjoy it.",
    "June 8, 2002 was an 80's renaissance for me. Playing an emulated ColecoVision on my PC, listening to Huey Lewis, Prince, and Men At Work, watching the A-Team on TNN, and seeing this film from 1989. I still enjoy the decade of feathered mullets, jerri-curled hair, acid-washed jeans, skinny ties, dominant pop music, and terrible fashions. The 90's will never have that to live down (except terrible fashions, but not as bad).<br/><br/>When Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure became the surprise hit of 1989, it made a star of everyone's favorite Lebanese-Canadian-U.S. rock 'n rolling actor, Keanu Reeves, who is one of the top stars at the box office today and one of the few likeable people in Tinseltown. It seems that he still carries a bit of Theodore \"Ted\" Logan in all his movies.<br/><br/>He and Alex Winter (an indie film dynamo) play Bill and Ted, a couple of 80's California dudes who want to start their own rock band (Wyld Stallyons). However, both are flunking in high school and will be expelled unless they get an A+ in history. To make matters worse, Ted will be sent to the military by his father, therefore squashing their dreams of rock stardom. Enter Rufus (George Carlin), a man from the future who plays Clarence to the boys George (shades of It's A Wonderful Life) who gives them a telephone booth. With it, they decide to use it to collect great historical figures and bring them to San Dimas, California to show them how mankind has evolved.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film holds up today. Bill and Ted are truly likeable boneheads and both Reeves and Winter deliver fine performances. Carlin is funny in his appearances, showing that he doesn't need trash-talk to be entertaining. The dialogue is truly amusing, probably because no one talks like that any more. The only weakness is that it's an 80's film, so if you didn't grow up in that era, you might not understand why there's music playing throughout the film, or why everyone looks and dresses so weird (yes, that's how everyone looked in the 1980's). The DVD version is quite nice, but it only has a trailer as a bonus. Still, a must watch, and much better than all the copycat films (including the horrible Dude, Where's My Car?). Party On!",
    "The future of movies doesn't seem too bright since all we're getting are remakes, adaptations and unnecessary prequels/sequels and that's why original stuff like SOURCE CODE can really make my day.<br/><br/>Honestly, the trailers and initial premise didn't seem promising; some soldier can travel back in time and has to stop an some evil terrorist from bombing America. At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it.<br/><br/>Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. <br/><br/>To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.",
    "\"The Godfather: Part II\" is a very suspenseful drama with a very exciting story, with great acting and great special effects. I would definitely recommend you watch this movie...but first watch the original classic from 1972 \"The Godfather\" . The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel.",
    "Well, I'll tell you what. I'm not a big fan of animated features but this one was a blast and a half. Just when I thought Flash the Sloth at the Zootown DMV couldn't be topped, we wind up meeting Mr. Big doing the Marlon Brando \"Godfather\" bit. I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn't run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn't stop laughing.<br/><br/>I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis's Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.<br/><br/>As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like 'being all you can be' and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I'll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - \"I want to try even though I could fail...\". It's a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don't measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message.",
    "I really enjoy the Star Trek TV series (original, TNG and DS9) and admit that I am late to this review. As much as I enjoy Star Trek and its ideals I had watched Star Wars The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams and I hated that. Star Wars rebooted with completely non-plot for pre-teens and one-liners, wise-cracks and plot holes so big that even Donald Trump's ego could drive through them was not for me.<br/><br/>So, anyway with a certain amount of hesitation I finally watched the reboot of Star Trek.... and it was as bad as I feared. Since it was expected I was not disappointed, but by gosh what is with the people who hire the director JJ Abrams? He makes every character a cartoon character. Never mind that the utopian and progressive society of the Federation is completely glossed over and ignored, but these characters with the formulaic backgrounds and corny lines and false tensions is just terrible. The Vulcans and Romulans' feud has never been as cliché-ridden I would say.<br/><br/>Look, I get it. People pay for reboots and remakes and sequels and so Hollywood serves them up (or is it the other way around?), but use some imagination, have one novel or original idea at least. I am too old for cartoons... which explains why I won't be watching the next Star Trek or fifteen Star Wars coming out. Obviously the director JJ Abrams is specialized in reboots and remakes and sequels and not original ideas.",
    "First off, let me state emphatically that I'm referring to the REAL version of the film, not the pathetic crippled creature distributed as \"Warriors of the Wind\" on video. Although I must admit that I first fell in love with the movie in that form, I have now seen the full subtitled version, and I place a hideous curse on those who hacked over 20 minutes from its running time.<br/><br/>Although the incredible \"Princess Mononoke\" later upstaged this early work in terms of art and detail, in many ways I still prefer \"Nausicaa\". Its imaginitive and well-conceived world puts me in mind of Dune with its feuding factions, its giant creatures, and its strong ecological message. Even with a rather long running time, the story moves very briskly (boiled down as it was from a very lengthy manga series). The music deserves special mention, as well, as it is a large step up from the electronic pop stylings of most anime.<br/><br/>If you can get your hands on a copy of the original version, you'll find it more than worth the effort.",
    "I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.",
    "SPOILER: This movie was just magical.<br/><br/>The Force has become like Harry Potter magic, with a new spell every day or so.<br/><br/>Rey is just magical. With practically training whatsoever she can take on Luke and Kylo and win.<br/><br/>Snoke is magical. He appeared out of nowhere in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi has such fantastic Force powers (never before seen in the entire Star Wars Universe) and yet can't tell when his protege is scheming to slice him in two (but could fell his every throught earlier, and even manipulate him and Rey's thoughts and get them to intergalactically Skype each other and even send water through space).<br/><br/>Luke is magical. He can magically project himself light years away and even bring solid things (the lucky dice) with him. Then dies magically for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Yoda is magical. His Force-ghost actually has more Force powers than when he was alive! Calling down lightning from the sky??? Heck, why don't the Jedi just do that when fighting on Tattooine or whatever? And if Force-ghosts still have Force powers why not the whole gang of Anakin, Ben and Yoda take on Snoke?<br/><br/>Rose is magical. She appears out of nowhere and just happens to go along with Finn on a completely unnecessary mission to find a code breaker, and find not one but TWO code breakers, one of which is in the SAME CELL as they are. I mean, is that magical or what?<br/><br/>Leia is magical. Previously in 7 movies only having the barest abilities in the Force, she now can survive in space for quite a long time and even open her eyes without getting them immediately frozen, and Force-Mary Poppins herself back to the space ship. Magical!<br/><br/>I could go on and on. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it's one shameless Deus Ex Machina after another. And don't even get me started on the stupid feminist nonsense, the inane attempt at comedy, the stupid characters who go nowhere in their characterisation, the stupid casino subplot, the stupid \"saving\" of Finn who wanted to sacrifice himself by Rose who magically now has feeling for him and both of them magically survive without getting shot at by the entire First Order army. Oops, I did go on and on.<br/><br/>If you make a movie, you need to make sure your movie stays in the universe it came from. Not invent new rules, new powers, new super villains, new behaviours from old characters, etc. out of bloody nowhere.",
    "A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>\nDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says \"Russell Crowe\", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a \"hunk\" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.<br/><br/>And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.<br/><br/>And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.<br/><br/>At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",
    "Tony D'Amato(Al Pacino) is the head coach of the Miami Sharks who are owned by the Christina Pagniacci(Cameron Diaz) who is using the Miami Franchise only for profit. Trouble stirs up after long time star quarterback Cap Rooney(Dennis Quaid)is injured along with his back up bringing in third string quarterback Willie Beamen(Jamie Foxx) who becomes the face of the franchise after having great game after great game. The only problem is that he plays only with his head and not with his heart, with an aging team that needs an emotional leader to guide them to victory. Also Starring: James Woods, Matthew Modine, LL Cool J, Bill Bellemy, Lawrence Taylor, Charelton Heston, Aaron Eckhart, and John C. McGinley.<br/><br/>In a cinema that rarely produces pro football movies, this is the cream of the crop. It captures the reality along with the heroic story of a nobody rising to the top. The movie is humorous, dramatic, and a thriller for all sports fans.<br/><br/>This is not only one of Oliver Stone's best films but this is also the start of Jamie Foxx's \"good\" acting career. Forget what the critics said about Collateral or Ray being the beginning for Jamie Foxx. It was Any Given Sunday. Willie Beaman is a complex character and Foxx nailed the part. He was magnificent. He played the part to perfection and out shined the great Al Pacino. The supporting cast was also incredible with great performances from Cameron Diaz, LL Cool J, James Woods, and surprisingly John C. McGinley. It is very rare to find a great dramatic football movie but this is definitely one those small few.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the greatest sports movies of all time and it is highly enjoyable for adult audiences.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.<br/><br/>No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that, you're probably going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.<br/><br/>No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.<br/><br/>The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.<br/><br/>Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.<br/><br/>It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.<br/><br/>That being said, the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.<br/><br/>I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed & bigger budgeted movies, it will be a movie like this one, that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.<br/><br/>And while we're at it, hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive, well acted portrayal.",
    "From hit or miss comedy to Get Out, Jordan Peele proves to us that he has certainly matured as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Get Out is one of the best and most refreshingly original horror movies in the last decade.\nRather than having in your face predictable jump scares and cheesy music, Get Out dwells on the mind and relies on the fear of the unknown while giving subtle messages on racism and what's it like to be black in America and for an anti-racism movie everything is handled very well due to Peele's great writing.\nAs I've already mentioned the best aspect of Get Out is the writing; the characters are intelligent people and behave like logical human beings instead of cliché horror movie idiots. Everything happens for a reason and there is a meaning behind everything. Also unlike other horror movie clichés Get Out doesn't fake its scares or replaces them with needless humour. Instead, the humour (mainly Lil Rel Howery's character) is perfectly balanced with the story and shows up at adequate times.<br/><br/>Creepy, unsettling and filled with brilliant performances (primarily from Daniel Kaluuya) and even better writing, Get Out perfectly represents the US society in its current era.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8+/10",
    "SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.<br/><br/>The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to \"weed out all non-hackers\". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes \"Cowboy\" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes \"Gomer Pyle\" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. <br/><br/>The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.<br/><br/>The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined \"hours of boredom, seconds of terror\" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. <br/><br/>'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the \"duality of Man\" according to Jung. 10/10",
    "Similar to the first Ice Age, the promotional material for the sequel was out in the theatres way in advance, and courtesy of the Scrat character too, up to its usual antics of getting to that elusive acorn. Here, Scrat opens the movie, and emulating the style of the first, he provides most of the laughs, also as an intermission from the actual scenes from the main cast.<br/><br/>Our gang of prehistoric animals are back - Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabre-tooth Tiger (Denis Leary). We learn that Sid has gone into the early childhood business, educating the young minds of pre-historic brats. However, I felt that this movie was somehow darker in tone than the original. While the original was one which dealt with hope, this one had its setting in extinction, disaster and death.<br/><br/>The valley which they live in is threatened by the melting ice, no thanks to global warming. So all the animals embark on a journey to salvation, to that rumored ark which will save them from the massive floods to come. Along the way, our trio meets up with another trio of characters, who were added to expand the cast, featuring 2 Possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), and another, but female, mammoth (Queen Latifah).<br/><br/>Needless to say, Manny's still anti-social, and Diego can't get along with those rascal possums who get on his nerves, and Sid's the \"philosopher\" ever providing the laughs. Various themes like romance (hey, we got 2 mammoths here), friendship, trust, and believing in oneself to overcome one's phobia get covered. Pretty wide scope, but they manage to fit in place nicely.<br/><br/>The villains in this sequel are pretty nasty, besides the looming natural disaster, we have two sea creatures with nasty teeth and attitude, as well as menacing vultures ever ready to pounce on the flesh of animals who have fallen.<br/><br/>But it's not all that bleak. Keep a lookout too for that mad sloth song-and-dance sequence, which has potential to become the next ear worm ala Madagascar's zany \"you-got-to-move-it\" song. The animation is as usual, top notch, and I just can't get enough of the photo-realistic ice and water landscape.<br/><br/>This is one piece of animation that doesn't rely too much on sight gags, of spoofing current affairs, but one filled with more witty dialogue and kept on an even keel with its interesting storyline. Though at times it might feel clichéd, somehow it excelled in its execution.<br/><br/>And that makes this sequel, as enjoyable as, if not better, than the original. Recommended stuff this week!",
    "I was a Texas Western graduate in 1966 and attended the school all four previous years that Don Haskins (\"the Bear\") coached the basketball team. Of course, Coach Haskins came to TWC in 1961 and built his team over 5 years, not in one year as the movie tells it. I went to every home game in 1965-66 and remember every one as if it were yesterday. I watched all of the away games that were televised, including all of the games the Miners played in the NCAA tournament. Even though the producers of \"Glory Road\" took considerable artistic license, the story is mostly true. Here are some facts. The Miners blew away fourth ranked Iowa during a holiday tournament that season. It wasn't even close as the movie depicts it. The great comeback was against New Mexico in the \"Pit\". When Hispanic guard David Palacio came in to play in the second half, the team seemed to settle down and came from a 20 point deficit to win in overtime. The incredibly close game, and probably best game in America that year between the true best college teams in America was the Regional final between third ranked TWC and fourth ranked Kansas (not #1 Kentucky and #2 Duke in the final four semifinal), when Jo Jo White made that last second basket in overtime with his foot on the base line. The Miners went on to beat Kansas 81-80 in double overtime. Then the Miners beat Utah in the first game of the final four. If white player Jerry Armstrong hadn't defended against Utah's great Jerry Chambers, a black player, the Miners probably wouldn't have made it to the championship game against Kentucky. Chambers was beating every defender badly, including Lattin, Shed, and Flournoy, until Armstrong was put in to cover him. Chambers finished with 38 points, mostly in the first half and was the tournament's MVP.<br/><br/>Coach Haskins is beloved by every El Pasoan, whether living in the city now or not, and is a true American treasure. It's wonderful for the rest of the country and the world to finally learn about \"the Bear\" and his great 1966 Miner team that El Paso has known and loved for 40 years. It's much more than a basketball story, it's a story about tolerance and what hard work and discipline can do through the leadership and determination of a great coach and human being.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, especially Josh Lucas' performance as \"the Bear\". His performance was spot on. The young actors playing on the team were outstanding. The early tensions shown between the black and white players in the movie did not exist according to the real players on that team. The book \"Glory Road\" is a must read, because it tells the true story told by \"the Bear\", Don Haskins, himself. I also recommend David Lattin's book \"Slam Dunk to Glory\". The producers should have shown the real life characters, including Coach Haskins, Pat Riley, and some of the actual 1966 players earlier in the credits, because most of the audiences leave the theater without knowing they're going to be interviewed. I thought that was the most interesting part of the movie. The movie and the story deserve a perfect 10. I hope it wins some awards.",
    "Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot in the way of story and character development, but suffice it to say, it serves its purpose. What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. The pop culture references are still present, but I found them to be more clever and funny this time around, and in much smaller amounts. I was smiling through virtually the entire film, and had about 5 or 6 hard laugh-out-loud moments throughout. As expected, I was also very impressed by the voice cast in this movie. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen's performance as B.O.B.. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway.<br/><br/>The 3D, while not used as effectively as it was in Coraline, is still one of the more impressive showcasings that I've seen, and that's largely due to the film's incredible action sequences. Seriously, this is some of the best action that I've seen in an animated film; as far as I'm concerned, it's right up there with that of The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Monsters vs. Aliens to be a surprisingly entertaining film, with clever and witty dialogue, as well as terrific action. I'm not usually in favor of sequels, but if they're able to keep it as balanced and charming, I would honestly like to see this become a successful, long-running franchise. Nice job, folks at DreamWorks Animation.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.<br/><br/>He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.<br/><br/>Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",
    "\"Not only is Singer's film-making aesthetically frustrating (lacking coherent visual rhythm) but his juvenile regard of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler -- one of 15 documented attempts -- is intellectually insulting...\" New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film.

A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in.

I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...<br/><br/>What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.<br/><br/>It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.<br/><br/>If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that \"I was on the edge of my seat\" throughout the second half of the film.<br/><br/>So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.",
    "This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "\"I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time\", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use \"the weapon\".<br/><br/>There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "I love watching movies that leave you just thinking at the end. This movie really did that. Now I'm not really sure why it has such bad reviews but i really liked it and would definitely recommend watching it. <br/><br/>Its not another end of the world movie where your main characters saves their family and end up surviving at the end, which is something i liked because it shows how Nick cages's character has to cope with knowing that him and his family will die and theirs no stopping it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ending and how everything comes together at the end to show that this is Gods doing. You would never expect that from the way its played out, other than the foreshadowing from his son talking about not believing god at the beginning",
    "The first time I saw this film, I was suitably impressed but found I couldn't enjoy it completely.  In order to keep up with the relentless pace of the plot, I didn't pay as much attention to the writing and the performances as I should have.  When it was over, I felt the breakneck pace of the story overshadowed the screenplay and acting, rendering the film an accomplished reprisal of fact but not much else.<br/><br/>What a difference a second viewing made.  My familiarity with the plot allowed me to appreciate all the finer details of the film.   Watching Redford and Hoffman's disciplined performances as Woodward and Bernstein, for instance, is like watching two expert tennis players work in tandem with one another.  When they act together, there is a delightful give-and-take, two masters working their way into a wonderful groove.  While they appear steady and reserved on the surface, the two actors radiate a noticeable undercurrent of excitement and dread, as if underneath their stern countenances they're screaming, \"Holy sh*t!  I can't believe we're doing this!!\"  Redford, not the strongest dramatic actor, finds his normal-guy niche here and gives one of his best performances.  Hoffman is equally strong, making even the simplest scene seem like a masterpiece (the \"count to 10\" phone scene comes to mind).<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Pakula communicates the idea of these two reporters being completely outnumbered by the people responsible for the Watergate break-in.  I loved the numerous overhead shots of Woodward and Bernstein that pull up, up, up, until they're nothing more than specks in the dirty streets of DC.  (This technique is also used in the classic scene where the two guys are searching through old records and the camera pulls up to the ceiling and shows them seated along the edge of a circular series of desks.)<br/><br/>The film rockets right along, leaving the viewers as excited over the reporters' discoveries as they are.  William Goldman's script helps in this regard, I think, sticking straight to the meat and cutting out any unnecessary roughage.  The dialogue gets right down to business while working in realistic vocal habits and the like.  Redford really captures this well (listen to his stammering and self-corrections when he talks on the phone to sources - great stuff!).<br/><br/>I can't recommend \"All the President's Men\" enough.  It's tightly-structured, fiercely-paced, and captivating as all get-out.  If necessary, watch it twice: once to find out who's who, the second time to savour the handiwork.  If you want to talk more about it, leave a red flag on the potted plant on your balcony.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "Definitely not my favorite of the 3 but it's hard when the first 2 were just that good. It still portrays well, from my historical knowledge, much of the struggle of the mob families to legitimize their business dealings and try to enjoy life in the later age of the mafia in America. Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films.",
    "Please take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really write reviews, but I really felt compelled to say something about this movie and it's decaying genre.<br/><br/>I'm conflicted, because I know my opinion is getting more and more jaded with every new superhero flick- but I am quickly reaching the end of my rope here. All these movies feel so predictable and cliché anymore, and as much as I truly want to enjoy them it is becoming more and more difficult.<br/><br/>The main actors in this movie were pretty good, but what can you do with yet another weak story that has already been rehashed in other films. The writing felt subpar, and in the end it came off as being full of gimmicks and convenient sub plot.<br/><br/>It just doesn't feel real anymore, it doesn't feel believable. It feels like a fantasy world created for superfans who never take a step back and critique.<br/><br/>These superhero movies are becoming more and more uninspired, and while I try to give them all a chance I am just getting tired of it all. It feels like the quality is being diluted, all that matters anymore is the quantity. All that matters is the money.<br/><br/>I still hold out hope- just look at the 'zombie' genre. Just because there is dilution within the genre doesn't mean a sporadic gem can't be made. However, if you are of a similar mindset as me, you might want to keep looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!",
    "No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in \"10 Rillington Place\" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in \"American Psycho\". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",
    "There are few elements that actually work in this prequel, but none of them are enough to compensate for the lack of creativity, poor execution, terrible writing and awful looking special effects, ruining what it could've been a potentially promising spin-off from a great character.",
    "Amistad is a very well crafted, well acted, and well told story. It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad 'mutiny', and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America's darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.<br/><br/>Amistad ranks as one of McConaughey's finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. <br/><br/>Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.",
    "A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands' competition.<br/><br/>Unbelievable? Yes. What's more unbelievable is that somehow the whole thing works  Jack Black's over-the-top enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, the edge-of-disaster suspense is continued throughout the length of the movie, and by the end the audience is so desperate to see how the kids (who they all play their own instruments by the way) perform in the concert that seat wetting would probably go unnoticed. Joan Cusack, as the gobsmacked headmistress, delivers a performance that is worth the price of your cinema ticket in itself. Achieving such tears-down-the cheeks laughter and adrenalin-packed excitement for air guitar music is nothing short of miraculous.<br/><br/>School of Rock is a movie that promises entertainment and delivers. Everything is as it says on the packet. For sheer feelgood factor, this movie is unbeatable  and you can even take the kids!",
    "No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. Because they don't need to. The Spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are. But that doesn't mean they should not try to. Why did this movie get made? Simple, Sam Raimi wasn't given enough time to make a fourth spider-man film so he quit, and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen. This movie wasn't made for any other reason.<br/><br/>First off, Peter Parker doesn't have a goal in this movie. At first its to find out what happened to his parents, which isn't explained in this movie. After half an hour he now tries to control his new powers, in scenes that don't help the audience. In the original spider-man, Peter learned about his powers in a controlled environment, he didn't beat up innocent people on a subway train. It's nice to know no one on that train reported that a man beat up five people while climbing walls. But Peter learning his powers can't be an entire focus in the movie, so we kill Uncle Ben. This time it doesn't work because the only reason Peter let the criminal get away was because Peter couldn't get a chocolate milk. To get so upset that he couldn't afford a chocolate milk that he would let a robber get away with the stores money is a contrivance in every way. So for about ten minutes Peters new goal is to bring uncle Ben's murderer to justice, let the police can't link all these look alike criminals spider-man does capture with the man who did kill peters uncle. After a while he just stops doing this, with no reason! And there is still about an hour left, so what are we going to do now? How about introduce that main villain you've been promising us? The Lizard is horribly written in every scene he's in. Why does he go to so much trouble to knock cars off of a bridge just to tell one guy (who is never seen afterwords) that their vaccine isn't ready yet? Because we needed another action scene. After that they bring up that the daily bugle wants pictures of the lizard, a point that doesn't amount to anything, except the lizard finding out who spider-man is. For someone as smart as Peter Parker has been set up to be it was really stupid for him to put his name on the camera he was using to take pictures of the lizard.<br/><br/>The climax doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first being this is the same climax we've seen in about four other superhero movies. The second one being there are no stakes. Only half of Manhattan would be infected 8 minutes after the lizard started his chemical missile, decreasing the people at risk greatly. Also THERE'S A CURE FOR THIS!! You know, the thing Gwen has been working on for the past 6 minutes? Whoever gets infected can just get the cure shot into them afterwords, and as of right now there are only 10 people infected, so why waster your time trying to put the cure into the missile that will stretch half of Manhattan and only effect 10 people?! <br/><br/>Gwen Stacy's dad dies and tells Peter to leave Gwen out of this, and proceeds to still date Gwen. What a great way to respect someone who died protecting people! Don't watch this movie, don't waste your time with this movie, even Spiderman 3 was better than this, so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy, at least those movies had effort put into them.",
    "I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. <br/><br/>I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "2012's Magic Mike wasn't exactly about the stripping. Sure, it features a lot of it, but the real center of the movie was the lifestyle of its main character, Mike. This latest installment showcases more of the crew and how they put up the show. It's more choreography driven than some commentary, which actually made it more appropriate to this material. It still has the stunning style of the first one, though it mostly feels quite forced, but if the movie tries to be itself, then there it actually shines. Magic Mike XXL indeed brings much of what you expect from it.<br/><br/>While the first movie basically shows the art of its aesthetics, this sequel rather shows the art of stripping. The story isn't quite remarkable; it's so simple that it's nothing more than an excuse to show more of these acts, which is both a good thing and otherwise. But really, that's what the target audience really came here for. Just like the first one, it's all atmosphere than following a plot. We just see these characters trying to get along, hint some commentary, and do some stripping. The difference however is the stripping is the real showcase, as in the direction and choreography improves within that aspect which makes these performances speak what this movie is truly about. People would immediately think that this would only appeal female viewers, but even as a straight man as I am, I would actually be impressed by the choreography displayed on those scenes.<br/><br/>The direction does try to keep Soderbergh's style going in this sequel, though only eschewing the intense sepia and welcoming other colors on the daylight. The new style is sometimes indefinite, specifically the vague lighting in some scenes, but then, the movie eventually breaks the pretense once the characters start dancing on screen, having more focus on their moves, and of course, bodies. Star, Channing Tatum, still has the charm as he always has. The other performers also get their characters expanded, staying natural whenever they bond and fight off on screen, treating them beyond than typical eye candy compared to the first one.<br/><br/>Many may call Magic Mike XXL a totally needless sequel or a cash grab for those who seek for more endless dose of shirtless men, but I believe this movie actually exists to make up for its own value. The story may not be as meaty as its predecessor's, but it shows everything what its audiences actually wanted for it. And it is done elegantly, proving that stripping apparently has more to offer than just lust for flesh. It sounds incredibly weird if you say it that way, but looking at these performances seems like this is an art that we didn't see coming. Again, there's nothing remarkable about the story, though if you're curious about the appeal of this career, then it gives a room for fascination.",
    "I give this movie a 10 because it has a message. It has a true purpose to it, which effects nearly every man on the planet.<br/><br/>Ladies, you can listen to this, but be reasonable. Guys, we all masturbate. Some of us do it more than others, most of us look at porn. Some of us only masturbate to porn and some of us have real hard fetishes.<br/><br/>This movie points to the problem, the process of porn turning our heads, making us believe in perfection and making us ultimately selfish as lovers.<br/><br/>You watch porn, you don't have to please a woman, you don't have to worry about anyone but yourself. It is all perfect. In the real world, in relationships, the other person matters just as much as you, but sometimes, even the real thing is not as good as the fantasy and the ease of it.<br/><br/>Don Jon is about that confusion of liking and appreciating porn more than real women, of becoming addicted to the idea of 'perfection' and the ultimate realization of the effect it has on all us men, making us irritated little boys, incapable of truly connecting with another person.<br/><br/>The message is not that porn is bad, only the way we think and use it is misleading to reality.<br/><br/>But, this is not the type of movie to watch with the family, the girl; it's funny, but not a comedy in a spoof and clown type of way. Watch this movie alone, think about yourself and how porn effects you. It will benefit you greatly.",
    "That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.<br/><br/>This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.<br/><br/>The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.<br/><br/>I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.<br/><br/>I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.<br/><br/>This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant \"hungry for more.\" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.<br/><br/>Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful. I appreciate the positive feedback from everyone! If you enjoyed this review, please click on cinephile-27690 and click \"reviews\" on the right for more reviews!

The proposed algorithm is tested on several cultural heritage objects to evaluate the efficiency and reliability of the method. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in identifying and extracting curve-structures compared to traditional image processing techniques. This study opens up new possibilities for advancing research in the field of digital humanities, and specifically, in cultural heritage studies.",
    "This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for image segmentation leveraging the complexities within network structures. Basic algorithms have been adapted to operate within the scope of complex networks, opening up innovative dimensions in the field of image segmentation. Specifically, the study focuses on the segmentation of images into meaningful and coherent regions based on network principles. Validation of the proposed model was conducted through intensive simulations on various images and the results substantiate that the network-based algorithms deliver more accurate and detailed partitions compared to existing image segmentation methods. This suggests that the methodology could potentially reshape the image segmentation domain, by addressing its inherent limitations. Hence, this framework serves a dual purpose of not only enhancing the quality of image segmentation, but also contributing to the understanding of complex network theory.",
    "This paper presents an advanced method for image segmentation based on Learning Automata, focusing on the application of multiple thresholds. The principal goal is to overcome challenges associated with conventional single threshold and manually chosen multiple thresholds techniques, which often lead to inefficient image segmentation. The proposed scheme involves a recursive process of image segmentation and pixel classification, leveraging Learning Automata's capability of quickly and adaptively converging to the optimal solution. Experimental results reveal significant improvements in terms of accuracy, robustness and performance time over prevalent image segmentation methods. This research demonstrates the potential for successfully implementing Learning Automata in complex image processing tasks.",
    "In a bid to address the escalating issue of childhood obesity and promote a healthy lifestyle among young people, the Conservative Party has pledged to provide free sports lessons to children in the UK.\n\nThe proposed scheme focuses on offering free extracurricular activities, which the Party's officials hope will increase the participation rates in sports among the youth and foster an appreciation for physical health. It is part of a broader health and wellbeing initiative put forward by the Conservatives.\n\nThe party, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has described the initiative as \"an investment in the health of our nation’s children\". They believe that making sports lessons more accessible could help to tackle rising rates of obesity and associated health problems, which are increasingly prevalent among young people.\n\nDetails of the proposed scheme include extending the school day to accommodate additional sports lessons and encompass a diverse range of activities. The extra sports classes would not impinge on academic learning times, rather it seeks to maximize the productive use of after-school hours. Currently, the list of sports is being curated to cater to different interests and capabilities, but football, athletics, gymnastics, and netball have all been mentioned.\n\nThe Prime Minister has hailed the strategy as a win-win, saying: \"Not only will free sports lessons keep our children healthy, but they will also teach them about teamwork, discipline, and resilience. These are invaluable life skills that they can carry with them into their adult lives.\"\n\nHowever, the pledge has drawn scrutiny from some quarters, with critics pointing to the ongoing budget constraints faced by many schools. The Labour Party has called for greater clarity on how the proposed scheme will be funded, with Shadow Education Secretary stating: \"We support any move to increase physical activity among young people. However, without adequate funding, this promise runs the risk of becoming another empty Tory pledge.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the announcement has been welcomed by various sports bodies and health campaigners. Baroness Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympic athlete and Chair of UK Active, said: \"This is a much-needed initiative. We have seen the powerful impact that sport can have on young people's physical and mental health, as well as their overall development.\"\n\nWith the UK witnessing one of the highest rates of childhood obesity in Europe, the need for immediate action to promote a more active lifestyle has never been greater. The Tories' pledge for free sports lessons could represent a significant step towards resolving this health crisis, pending further details on the delivery and funding of this scheme.",
    "US crude oil prices have surged above $53 per barrel, marking its highest point in about a year amid increased demand and optimism about a post-coronavirus global economic recovery.\n\nReports suggest this surge is a direct consequence of improving sentiment towards the oil industry. Oil prices have been witnessing an uptick due to a series of positive factors including the gradual rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally, leading to hopes of revived travel, transportation, and overall energy demand.\n\nAdditionally, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies have been effective in managing output which has also added stability to the market by maintaining an adequate supply-demand balance.\n\nA recent drawdown in US crude stocks coupled with a weaker dollar has further strengthened the crude oil market. As the dollar weakens, commodities priced in the currency become cheaper for holders of other currencies, driving demand up.\n\n\"This is a result of a confluence of several factors supporting oil prices - vaccine rollouts, a likely economic rebound, OPEC+'s supply management, and last but not least, falling U.S. oil inventory,\" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.\n\nHowever, despite the rising prices, many US oil companies are struggling with debt and bankruptcies after the pandemic-led downturn drastically reduced global demand for oil in 2020.\n\nThe benchmarks, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent Crude, saw significant growth. WTI, the US oil benchmark, traded at nearly $54 per barrel while Brent Crude exceeded $56. \n\nAnalysts suggest these upward trends may continue in the near future as governments across the world expedite their COVID-19 vaccination programs and economies rebound. Market sentiment will also be buoyed by any additional evidence indicating more substantial fuel demand recovery.\n\nNonetheless, the oil industry is not completely out of the woods yet. The sector's future remains uncertain as global CO2 reduction measurements will significantly impact it. The new Biden administration's pledges to fight climate change and promote cleaner energy sources may also put long-term pressure on crude oil prices.\n\nBut for now, investors are focused on the oil market's recovery after a tumultuous 2020. A sustained improvement in prices could provide some breathing space for beleaguered oil and gas companies, while also offering much-needed support to oil-dependent economies around the world.",

    "Labour MP, Maxine White, has issued a surprising statement, commending the Conservative Party for their recent campaign initiatives and efforts. This unexpected commendation comes amidst the high tension between both parties in the midst of heated national debates.\n\nCommenting on the strategies employed by the Conservatives, the Labour MP for North Cumbria expressed a rare admiration for her adversarial party. Ms. White particularly noted the professionalism and efficacy exhibited in the Tories' approach towards climate change and economic issues.\n\nShe said, \"Although we may ideologically differ on a range of topics, as politicians, it's crucial to acknowledge effective practices wherever we see them. I appreciate the manner in which the Tories have managed to create a rather comprehensive and insightful campaign around the urgent issue of climate change.\"\n\nMs. White was also appreciative of the economic blueprint proposed by the Tories, asserting that the party had a coherent plan for economic recovery, which is of immense significance considering the current state of the British economy. \n\nThis unexpected praise from an unexpected source, however, was not without its criticisms. Ms. White affirmed her loyalty to the Labour Party, its policies and goals. \n\nShe explained, \"It does not mean I endorse or support all their decisions. There are many policies where we diverge significantly. My commitment to the Labour Party remains unwavered, and my pledge to advocate for solutions that will benefit the entirety of the nation’s population, not just the privileged few, is unaltered.”\n\nDespite further critiquing the Tories’ stance on social issues, Ms. White’s recognition of the uprightness in her opponents' campaign strategy highlights the potential for bipartisan discourse and collaboration in British politics.\n\nThis unusual praise has triggered discussions in political circles about the importance of recognising good policy and strategy regardless of party lines. Some have lauded Ms. White for her democratic spirit and willingness to break down party walls to encourage collaborative efforts and dialogue. Others, however, view this as a potential political strategy with unclear intentions.\n\nAs parties continue to gear up for the forthcoming elections, it remains to be seen how this unusual commendation will be mirrored in campaign strategies and future political discourse.",

    "General Electric (GE) has painted an optimistic picture of the global economy, despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nIn a recent statement, the conglomerate described the world economy as \"excellent,\" supported by robust divisions within the company, including renewable energy and health care. These sectors have shown strong growth amid the pandemic, offsetting losses in other areas like aviation.\n\nGE's chief executive officer Larry Culp told investors during their recent annual meeting that the company's decisive action at the onset of the economic downturn helped GE position itself strongly. He also added that GE's diverse and robust portfolio has been successful in navigating the current tumultuous economic climate.\n\nWhile acknowledging the negative impact of the pandemic on specific sectors like aviation and power, Culp maintained that there are \"more positives than negatives\" at the moment. He confirmed that GE's aviation profits would likely take a few years to recover fully.\n\nMeanwhile, GE's healthcare division proved to be highly resilient during the pandemic, seeing growth due to an increased demand for medical equipment. Similarly, the conglomerate's renewable energy sector thrived during the downturn, reflecting the global shift towards greener energy sources.\n\nEconomists have also praised GE for its confounding optimism amid global economic uncertainty, with some agreeing that such versatile conglomerates often manage to thrive in turbulent times. \n\nNonetheless, GE's outlook does not come without caveats. Analysts warn that the company's forecast hinges on the global success of vaccination programmes against Covid-19. \n\nIn conclusion, GE's verdict on the world economy could be seen as evidence that the global economic recovery is underway.

    "Hip-hop titan Eminem has officially broken the record in the UK album charts, earning his 10th consecutive No.1 album - outpacing rock 'n' roll icon Elvis Presley in the process. Elvis previously held the record for the most number one albums by a solo artist.\n\nEminem, whose real name is Marshall Bruce Mathers III, released his surprise album, 'Music to Be Murdered By' last Friday. The album features high-profile collaborations with artists such as Young M.A, Don Toliver, and late rapper Juice WRLD. It earned 36,000 chart sales in the first week, according to figures from the Official Charts Company.\n\nThe victory also puts Mathers on a par with other popular bands such as The Rolling Stones and Abba, who hold a similar record.\n\nEminem’s career took off in the 1990s under the guidance of producer Dr. Dre and over the past two decades, he has established himself as a pivotal figure in the world of hip-hop. The rapper from Detroit has been recognized not only for his lyrical prowess, but also his ability to confront his own personal demons through his music.\n\nPrevious chart-topping albums include 'The Marshal Mathers LP', 'The Slim Shady LP', 'The Eminem Show', 'Encore', 'Relapse', 'Recovery', 'The Marshal Mathers LP 2', 'Revival', and 'Kamikaze'. Each of these albums demonstrated his raw talent and underlined his standing as a global superstar.\n\nWhile presiding in a chart predominantly occupied by UK acts, after the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, Eminem is now the third international act to achieve 10 number one albums. \n\nEminem’s unannounced surprise release strategy appears to garner the intended response with 'Music to Be Murdered By' taking him straight to the top of the charts.

    "Former world number one, Justine Henin-Hardenne, suffered a shock defeat in the first round of the Australian Open, following her much anticipated comeback. The Belgian tennis star, who took an extended break from the professional circuit for personal reasons, was hoping for a triumphant return but was instead beaten by the lower ranked Italian player, Flavia Pennetta.\n\nHenin-Hardenne, a seven-time Grand Slam champion, was visibly struggling throughout the match and despite occasional flashes of her former brilliance, eventually succumbed to a 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) defeat. The match, which lasted two hours and fifteen minutes, was fiercely contested but Pennetta ultimately secured the victory.\n\nStruggling with her accuracy, Henin-Hardenne only managed to land 60% of her first serves and committed an alarmingly high number of unforced errors. She seemed to struggle with her rhythm and timing throughout the match, common issues for player coming back from a significant break. \n\nSpeaking at a post-match press conference, Henin-Hardenne played down any suggestions that her lacklustre performance could be attributed to her time away from the courts. She acknowledged that she was not at her best but also praised Pennetta for her strong performance. \n\nMeanwhile, Pennetta expressed surprise over her victory over Henin-Hardenne, whom she described as one of her tennis idols growing up.

    "Banks worldwide may be facing a serious security issue with their ATMs, as a large majority are still operating on outdated Windows software, leading to growing concerns over the potential for hacking and data theft. Experts warn that this could make banks an easy target for cybercriminals, who could exploit vulnerabilities in the system to steal funds or sensitive customer data.\n\nApproximately 70% of ATMs globally are reportedly using an older version of the Windows operating system, according to a recent survey by Kaspersky Lab, a renowned cyber-security firm. Out of this, over 75% are still using Windows 7, while the remainder are on previous iterations, such as Windows XP, which Microsoft officially ended support for in 2014. \n\nMicrosoft ceased providing free security updates and technical support for Windows 7 in January 2020, a move intended to encourage users to upgrade to its newer software. Despite this, many banks have yet to do so due to the substantial costs and logistical challenges involved in updating large ATM networks. \n\nThe implications of using outdated software are significant. Cybercriminals can exploit the lack of security updates to introduce malware into the ATM network, potentially enabling them to intercept and modify transactions, hijack ATMs remotely, or even initiate mass cash-outs since most ATMs don't have additional layers of protection. \n\nCybersecurity expert, Alex Holden, highlighted the serious risks associated with outdated Windows ATMs. \"Unprotected ATMs are an open invitation to hackers,\" he commented. \"They can easily locate vulnerabilities and launch sophisticated attacks.\"\n\nFurthermore, this doesn't only affect the financial institutions, but also the customers using these ATMs. Personal banking details and sensitive data may be at risk of being stolen, leading to potential financial loss and identity theft. For the banking industry that relies heavily on trust, this can result in serious reputational damage.\n\nSome banks, anticipating this issue, have entered into extended support agreements with Microsoft, whereby they continue to receive security updates despite the official end of support. However, this is merely a temporary solution and does not provide a long-term answer to the issue.\n\nThe banking and finance industry has been encouraged to accelerate their efforts to upgrade their systems. Cybersecurity firms suggest investing in secure operating platforms and implementing additional layers of security, such as encryption and multi-factor authentication, to protect against potential attacks.\n\n\"While upgrading ATM networks is a significant task, it is essential for ensuring the security of customer transactions and maintaining trust in the banking system,\" said Holden. The stark warning serves as a reminder to global banking institutions",
    "In a remarkably engaging League Two encounter at Edgar Street, Hereford United and Doncaster Rovers settled for a 1-1 draw. Both teams demonstrated relentless effort, with each side claiming a point in a match packed with numerous missed opportunities.\n\nThe Bulls welcomed the Rovers, looking for a much-needed win in front of their home crowd. However, despite their efforts, Hereford were held to a draw by a stubborn Doncaster side that refused to buckle under pressure.\n\nThe first half proved a tetchy affair, with neither side able to break the deadlock. But the stage was set for an enthralling second half after Doncaster opened the scoring right before halftime.\n\nDoncaster’s midfielder, who was on top form, bamboozled Hereford's defence with some slick passing and crossed for their striker, who calmly slotted home the opening goal. It seemed as though the Rovers would be heading back home with three points.\n\nHowever, the resilient Bulls refused to be tamed. With renewed vigour post half-time, Hereford flew out of the traps, stringing together multiple attacking plays. After several attempts, their endeavour paid off when they were awarded a penalty in the 65th minute.\n\nHereford's captain stepped up to take the spot-kick, drilling the ball into the bottom corner and leaving the Doncaster goalkeeper with no chance. The equaliser sent the home crowd into raptures and breathed much-needed life into Hereford's performance.\n\nThis deadlock spurred both teams to push for the winning goal, with chances coming at either end. However, despite additional time, neither side was able to snatch a late victory, culminating in a fiercely fought 1-1 draw.\n\nPost-match, Hereford's manager commended the fighting spirit of his team and expressed hope of climbing up the league ladder in the forthcoming fixtures. Likewise, Doncaster's manager praised his squad's resilience in responding to the Hereford pressure, maintaining their resolve during the challenging encounter.\n\nGiven the impressive performances by both teams, the fans were surely entertained. This appetising clash suggests high expectations for the remainder of the season. Despite the draw's bitter-sweet outcome, the fighting spirit exhibited by both Hereford United and Doncaster Rovers indicates both teams are ones to watch in the upcoming League Two fixtures.\n",
    "The Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, has confirmed he will press ahead with plans to introduce national ID cards, arguing that they are vital for national security and combating identity fraud.\n\nDespite the contentious nature of the scheme, Mr. Clarke declared that the ID cards would not breach civil liberties as critics have suggested. He told BBC News, \"I am doing this because I fundamentally believe that ID cards will help to build a safer Britain.\"\n\nThe argument for ID cards is based on preventing terrorism, organised crime, and illegal immigration, all of which Mr. Clarke says are aided by weak identification methods. Fears over the cost of the scheme, estimated to be over £5 billion, have been dismissed by the Home Secretary as he argued the benefits would outweigh the costs.\n\n\"We want to ensure that the rights and identities of honest citizens are protected and are not abused by those with ill intent,\" Mr. Clarke said. \n\nMr. Clarke also insisted that aspects of the scheme, such as iris recognition and fingerprinting, were vital elements in the prevention of identity theft.\n\nThe plans have faced criticism from various factions, including civil liberty groups and opposition parties. Shadow home secretary, David Davis, has previously described the ID card scheme as a \"technological nightmare\", questioning the perceived benefit in relation to the cost. \n\n“The government would better spend that money on more police officers, better border controls and more effective intelligence,\" Mr. Davis argued.\n\nLiberal Democrat spokesman, Nick Clegg, has raised concerns about privacy, stating that the scheme was a step towards creating a “surveillance state.” \n\nMeanwhile, civil liberties group Liberty, described the ID card scheme as an ‘expensive distraction’ from more effective measures to combat terrorism and fraud.\n\nDespite the ongoing controversy and debate, Mr. Clarke stressed that the scheme was in the national interest and that he would continue to push the legislation forward. He urged critics to consider the security and fraud prevention aspects of the program, assuring that strict controls would be in place to prevent any misuse of the data collected.\n\n\"The ID card scheme will not solve all the problems, but it is a very key weapon in our armoury,\" he said. \n\nThe Home Secretary's steadfastness is expected to result in further fiery debates, as ID cards remain a contentious issue on the political and social landscape.\n",

Smith, a rising figure in finance, has made significant strides in introducing disruptive technology, which has propelled the sector ahead, according to Doe.\n\n\"It's not very often that we come across individuals who carry such profound understanding and command in their chosen field,\" Doe announced at an industry conference yesterday. \"Bob Smith is, without doubt, one of these rare exceptions - pure genius.\"\n\nSmith, an understated figure, is known within the industry for his creativity and innovation but is yet to become a household name amongst the general public. Doe's comments, however, might be the catalyst that brings the spotlight onto Smith, who has spent the last decade developing technology-driven solutions for systemic issues in banking.\n\nMost recently, Smith has been the driving force behind an ultra-fast, AI-based loan approval platform that has cut down the processing time from weeks to hours. This allows banks to make quicker decisions and provide much-needed cash inflows to businesses and individuals. The technology has already been adopted by several major financial institutions, bringing significant improvements in efficiency, user satisfaction, and lower overheads.\n\nDoe outlined the transformative nature of Smith's innovations, \"Bob has brought fresh thinking and pioneering technology to an industry that was starting to show its age. His work exemplifies the kind of forward-thinking that the sector needs to keep up with the changing economic landscape.\"\n\nWithin the industry, there has been a recent wave of agreements that technologies, such as the kind Smith has been instrumental in developing, have become essential. The Covid-19 pandemic, in particular, has highlighted the importance of nimble responses and digital automation. The ability to speed up loan approvals, for instance, has been crucial in dealing with the financial effects of the pandemic.\n\nDoe closed his remarks on a note of hope, expressing the belief that innovators like Smith are guiding the future of the banking industry. \"We're fortunate to be witnessing the rise of a genius who will influence the future of banking, and our economy as a whole, for decades to come,” he said. \n\nHowever, Bob Smith's journey is far from over. Next on his ambitious agenda is tackling the issue of financial inclusion, hoping to make banking more accessible to millions who remain unbanked and underbanked. It's clear that the banking industry waits with bated breath to see what this 'genius' does next.",

    "Newcastle United are said to have set their sights on acquiring Chelsea defender Celestine Babayaro, according to club insiders. \n\nThe Magpies have reportedly been in talks with Chelsea over a possible deal for the 26-year-old Nigerian international, who is seen as an ideal addition to their defensive line. Babayaro, who has been struggling for first-team action at Stamford Bridge, is believed to be eager for the move in hopes of more playtime.\n\nBorn in Kaduna, Nigeria, Babayaro joined Chelsea from Belgian side Anderlecht in 1997 and quickly established himself as a regular starter. In recent seasons, however, he has found his opportunities limited due to increased competition within the team. \n\n\"Babayaro is a fantastic player, who comes with a wealth of Premier League experience\", said a Newcastle United spokesman, \"having him in our team could significantly bolster our defensive options\".\n\nNewcastle manager, who refused to discuss specific targets, confirmed that the club is seeking to bring in new faces in the January transfer window. \"We're looking to strengthen the squad where we can. The defence is a particular area we want to bolster with experienced and talented individuals\", he said.\n\nHowever, the potential move has sparked mixed reactions among fans. While some are excited about the prospect of having a player of Babayaro's experience and caliber, others expressed concerns about his recent lack of match play and potential fitness issues. \n\nThe speculated transfer fee is expected to be in the region of £1 million. If the deal goes ahead, it will continue a relationship between the two clubs that has seen other players such as Demba Ba and Christian Atsu switch between them in recent years.\n\nAs the speculation continues, the two clubs are yet to release any official statement regarding the potential move. However, in the event of successful negotiations, Babayaro could be donning the black and white shirt and running out onto St James' Park as early as next month.\n",
    "In a significant milestone for mobile telephone technology, mobile phones have now reached 20 years of use. This landmark achievement bears testament to the rapid technological advancements, compelling us to reflect on the journey so far and what the future might hold for this uniquely pervasive technology.\n\nInvented by Martin Cooper at Motorola in 1973, the maiden mobile phone call occurred over a decade prior to the widespread availability of the devices. However, it was not until the early 90s that mobile phones became integrated into everyday life. Since then, the global adoption of mobile phones has rocketed, with an estimated 5 billion mobile users worldwide as of now.\n\nThe first mobiles were large and cumbersome, with limited capabilities. However, they have evolved at breakneck pace over the last two decades. Included now are a mind-boggling array of features, from cameras and music players to internet browsing and GPS. The smartphone era, which started with the arrival of Apple's iPhone in 2007, has transformed mobiles into indispensable tools used for work, play, and everything in between.\n\nThey have arguably changed society as a whole, having profound impact on our daily lives, social interactions, and even the way businesses are operated globally. Today, in a world heavily reliant on technology, life without mobile phones seems unimaginable. \n\nHowever, this widespread use has also given rise to concerns about data privacy and security, addiction, mental health implications and environmental impact, as each upgrade prompts consumers to dispose of their old devices.\n\nAs mobiles clock 20 years of use, looking into the future, analysts predict even more radical transformations in their design, functionality, and application. Trends such as augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and 5G all promise to redefine the boundaries of what mobile phones can do.\n\nOn this two-decade anniversary, it is interesting to contemplate the incredible influence mobile phones have had, and how they will continue to steer many aspects of our lives. \n\nAs the mobiles celebrate this 20-year milestone, we can only anticipate how the technology will keep evolving in order to deliver even more powerful and constructive user experiences in the decades to come.",
    "Former England manager Kevin Keegan heaped praises on Robbie Fowler for a staggering comeback, calling the Liverpool legend a 'comeback king'.\n\nFowler, who's affectionately known as 'God' among the Liverpool faithful, had been suffering from a dip in form and a series of injuries that saw him spend more time on the bench than on the pitch. However, his sensational return to form took critics by surprise and won him nothing but praise from his peers and managers alike.\n\nKeegan, who was speaking at a charity event in Liverpool, spoke highly of Fowler's resilience. \"Fowler has always been a fighter,\" Keegan said. \"Even in the face of adversity, he never shies away from a challenge. His recent comeback is a testament to that. He’s a true professional, a comeback king, if you like.\"\n\nFowler’s return to form harks back to his heydays in Anfield when he was one of Liverpool's potent weapons, earning his stripes as one of England's most clinical strikers in the 90s.\n\nOnce considered a fallen star, Fowler's current resurgence has taken the footballing world by storm. A spate of sterling performances including his brace against arch-rivals Everton in the Merseyside derby underlines that. The striker seems to have rediscovered his Midas touch in front of goal, relighting optimism among the Anfield faithful.\n\nKeegan added, \"Not a lot of players can bounce back the way Robbie has. It’s one thing to have the talent but having the mental strength to overcome obstacles is something else. Fowler clearly has both in abundance.\"\n\nKeegan himself is no stranger to comebacks, having embarked on numerous ones during his illustrious career as both a player and a manager. His words of praise carry a lot of weight, particularly coming from someone who has experienced all the lows and highs that football can offer.\n\nRobbie Fowler's inspiring comeback signals a beacon of hope to other players going through a rough phase in their career. It underscores the importance of resilience, perseverance, and undying passion for the game, qualities Fowler exemplified in the face of adversity.\n\nHis story is a reminder to all that football, much like life, is never completely devoid of second chances. It tells us that even in the darkest hours, a will to fight back can reignite a dwindling career, a lesson Fowler teaches all too well.\n",

    "Former Manchester United striker Andy Campbell has revealed details about a long-standing feud within the club during his time at Old Trafford. The revelations could potentially cast a spotlight on the inner workings of one of the most successful football clubs worldwide. \n\nCampbell, who spent the majority of his football career at Middlesbrough and Cardiff City, moved to United as a promising 20-year-old striker in the late 1990s. \n\nThe former forward has now spoken out about a rift between two teammates that created a hostile environment behind the scenes. While Campbell has chosen to remain discreet about the identities of the individuals involved, his remarks highlight the pressure and tension often hidden from public view in top-tier football.\n\n\"There was a feud between two senior players that threatened to divide the team,\" Campbell explained during an interview on TalkSPORT. \"They were both influential figures in the dressing room, and when disagreements ensued, it led to some tense moments both on and off the pitch.\"\n\nDespite the dispute, Campbell asserted that the team's unity and determination to win overshadowed individual differences. The United squad, helmed by the renowned Sir Alex Ferguson during Campbell's stint, continued to perform at a top level, securing multiple titles.\n\nCampbell further added, \"These things are not uncommon in football. Big personalities clash; it's part of the game. But thanks to the much-valued leadership skills of Sir Alex, the situation never spiralled out of control.\"\n\nWhile the fiery temperaments and competitive nature of footballers are well-known aspects of the sport, insider revelations like Campbell's provide fascinating insights into the dynamics within a dressing room. Football fans and pundits will undoubtedly be speculating on the identities of the feuding players, but Campbell's memories of his time at Manchester United are a vivid reminder of the high pressures and intense relationships at the elite level of football.\n\nThe former striker currently works as a football pundit, reflecting on his insights into the game after hanging up his boots in 2012. His revelations about his time at Manchester United have added another intriguing chapter to the behind-the-scenes drama in the world of football. \n\nManchester United is yet to comment on Campbell's allegations.",
    "With only days remaining, Fiat Auto and General Motors Corporation are racing against the clock to finalize their deal or face potential legal complications. The deadline for their mega-merger approaches swiftly, with both automotive giants eager to solidify the transaction to safeguard their future market position.\n\nFiat and General Motors originally cemented their strategic partnership back in 2000, an alliance primarily focused on sharing costs and co-developing vehicles. Since then, they have managed to execute a series of successful joint ventures, setting a strong groundwork for this momentous consolidation.\n\nNow, the deadline for their exclusive negotiation period nears, and the pressure is mounting. Should the deadline pass without a new agreement, both parties may potentially face legal disputes or could enter the possibility of third-party negotiations. \n\nPreviously, Fiat has stepped in to provide cash influxes for General Motors during financial dry spells. Now it may use that to pressure General Motors into buying its remaining stake, a move that could help Fiat buffer its own economic struggles aggravated by the global pandemic and a rapidly transitioning auto industry.\n\nHowever, investors’ concerns have grown over Fiat’s provision, which enables it to legally force General Motors to buy the 90% of Fiat Auto that it does not already own. This could impose a multi-billion dollar burden on General Motors, deepening its financial woes perspective, and potentially unsettling the markets.\n\nThe iconic Detroit-based auto giant, General Motors, has however, rejected any obligations to purchase Fiat’s remaining stake, arguing the 'put option' was no longer valid because of substantial alterations in original agreements during financial restructuring exercises in years past. \n\nThis situation adds to wider uncertainty that has already shaken the automobile industry. From supply chain disruptions to decreased demand due to the pandemic, it is clear that car manufacturers are facing a drastically changing landscape.\n\nAs the merger talks grow tense, it is becoming clear that the negotiations aren’t just about sharing resources and combining strengths – it is also about survival in a fiercely competitive industry that is racing towards an electric and automated future. \n\nUpon any successful agreement, the newly-formed auto behemoth would command a tremendous share of the global car market, fit to face rivalry from other industry titans such as Volkswagen and Toyota.\n\nAs the deadline looms, the wider industry, investors, and analysts will all be keeping a close eye on developments as the potential fate of two of the world's biggest car makers hangs in the balance.",
    "Microsoft has invited a select group of game developers for an exclusive preview of its forthcoming games console, Xbox 2. The move is an attempt to build up a library of games that will be available when the device is launched.\n\nThe series of events, held virtually due to the ongoing pandemic, has already commenced. Developers from all around the world attended detailed presentations about the machine's capabilities and performance potential.\n\nIn these sessions, Microsoft has been keen to promote the console's new features and benefits for game makers. The Xbox 2 is said to offer improved graphics and processing power, reducing the limitations previously experienced by developers. It's also expected to greatly enhance the gaming experience for users.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft has promised a smoother and more efficient development process for Xbox 2, with tools and software that will make creating games easier than ever. This could unlock a new level of potential for the next wave of video games, allowing developers to implement previously unattainable ideas and concepts.\n\nLast generation, Microsoft was criticized for the lack of diverse and interesting games at the Xbox One's launch. Offering developers a \"sneak peek\" at the Xbox 2 is a strategy to ensure a broad and high-quality launch lineup of games. This will not only attract gamers, but it will also differentiate Xbox 2 from competing platforms.\n\nHowever, the key for Microsoft will be to maintain this momentum after the console's release. The Xbox brand has a solid reputation to uphold, with a history of innovations and a loyal fan base. Microsoft will be looking to ensure that Xbox 2's personal, commercial, and technical strengths persuade both developers and players alike.\n\nCritics and fans will watch closely to see whether this strategy can give Microsoft the early advantage in the new console battle. With no release date confirmed yet for Xbox 2, there will be time for the developers to harness the power of the new console and deliver an impressive lineup of games. \n\nIn the meantime, the gaming community waits with bated breath, eager to know what the next generation of Xbox promises.",
    "In a landmark verdict, two men from the United States have become the first to be convicted under a new law targeting spam emails. Jeremy Jaynes and Jessica DeGroot, from Raleigh, North Carolina, were found guilty of trespassing on protected computers, and for possessing stolen email addresses, in violation of the country's highly publicised \"CAN-SPAM\" Act of 2003. \n\nJaynes and DeGroot are estimated to have sent out hundreds of millions of unwanted emails, promoting everything from pornographic websites to work-at-home schemes. According to prosecutors, the duo made over $24m from their operations.\n\nThe \"CAN-SPAM\" (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing) Act was passed in January 2003, to curb the growing menace of digital junk mail, which accounts for up to 90% of global email traffic. The law makes it illegal to use misleading subject lines, falsify the sender's address, or fail to include a physical postal address in the email.\n\nJaynes, considered one of the ten \"most prolific\" spammers globally was convicted on three felony charges and faces up to 15 years in prison. DeGroot, who was seen as less central to the operations, was convicted on three misdemeanor charges and could face up to one year in jail.\n\nExperts believe this case will test the potential effectiveness of the CAN-SPAM Act and could set a legal precedent. \n\n\"The conviction of Jaynes and DeGroot is a significant victory in the fight against spam,\" said Virginia Attorney General Jerry Kilgore. \"This case shows that laws, such as the CAN-SPAM Act, can work if effectively enforced.\"\n\nThe defenses for Jaynes and DeGroot claim that they were not fully aware of the full scope of the new law. They are planning to appeal.\n\nAs spam increasingly becomes a worldwide nuisance, causing billions in productivity loss, the conviction of Jaynes and DeGroot is seen as a crucial first step in holding spammers accountable for their actions. Although more high-profile spam-related trials may follow, the challenges posed by the international and anonymous nature of the internet could make enforcement a daunting task. \n\nMeanwhile, despite these legal measures, computer users are urged to remain vigilant and maintain online hygiene practices such as not opening unknown emails and keeping their software updated. \n\nThe sentencing date for Jaynes and DeGroot has not been set. This landmark ruling marks a significant progression in the ongoing battle against the spam scourge that plagues global digital",
    "Manchester United's reported proposal to offer partial refunds or rebates to season ticket holders has been met with mixed reactions from fans, amid the continued disruption of the football season due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\nThe club, which has around 55,000 season ticket holders, proposed a scheme that would allow fans to get partial refunds or a rebate on their season tickets if the remaining matches continue to be played behind closed doors or are cancelled. However, some supporters have criticised the proposal, arguing that a full refund should be offered considering the exceptional circumstance.\n\nMahmoud Abdullah, a season ticket holder for over ten years said, \"It feels like they are trying to capitalise on our loyalty. They should be offering a full refund regardless of whether the game is played behind closed doors or not. None of us could have foreseen this pandemic and we shouldn't be penalised for it.\"\n\nOn the other hand, some fans have commended the club for considering the financial implications for supporters during these trying times. Samantha Moore, another long-time fan said, \"I think it’s a fair offer during the current crisis. Most clubs wouldn't even consider a refund.\"\n\nThe club's forum, which includes representatives from the Manchester United Supporter’s Trust, has also voiced its opinion on the matter. Trust spokesperson, Kim Stratford, said, \"While we appreciate the club considering refunds or rebates, it's important for the final decision to be a fair assessment considering the exceptional circumstances.\"\n\nManchester United, the third richest club in the world according to Deloitte, has not yet made any official agreement regarding the proposal. It falls in line with other top-tier football clubs across Europe who are trying to find solutions for ticket holders amidst the hiatus in sporting events due to the pandemic.\n\nMan Utd club representatives have refused to give an official comment until a decision is finalised. As it stands, the final decision will not only massively impact Manchester United's loyal fan base, but it may also set a precedent for other clubs' approaches to tackling the financial implications caused by the global coronavirus crisis. \n\nThe club's handling of this issue will certainly act as a litmus test of their ability to reconcile the commercial interests of the club with the goodwill of their fan base in unprecedented times. Supporters will no doubt be closely watching how this plays out over the coming weeks.",
    "Microsoft has begun an extensive probe into an alleged spyware Trojan that some security experts believe have potentially infected millions of computers across the world.\n\nThe Redmond-based giant has alerted users of a sophisticated Trojan, dubbed as 'TrojanSpy:Win32/Bancos.AZ'. The company announced that it is currently in the process of investigating the software, considered to be a severe threat to computer users.\n\nTrojans are typically used by cybercriminals to gain illicit access to users' systems, often leading to data theft or damage. This particular Trojan appears to be categorised as spyware because of its ability to remotely monitor users' behaviour, extract sensitive information, and transmit it back to the attacker.\n\nIn a recent blog post, Microsoft's security team describes the Trojan as having the capability to monitor keystrokes and capture screenshots. Those are key tactics in stealing personal information like banking details or passwords.\n\nThe software giant advises users to keep their systems updated with the latest patches and are urged to run regular antivirus scans with up-to-date software. Moreover, the company has included detection for this Trojan in its Windows Defender antivirus software.\n\nAlthough it's not yet clear how widespread the Trojan is, or how many machines have been affected, Microsoft is making significant efforts to mitigate the potential damage. The company has also reinforced its commitment to working with law enforcement agencies globally to take down the infrastructure supporting such espionage campaigns.\n\nThe existence of such spyware reinforces concerns about the cybersecurity landscape globally. It underscores the ever-present need for robust, comprehensive cybersecurity policies and practices through both individual vigilance and collective action. \n\nMicrosoft's ongoing investigation points to the tech giant's commitment to securing its systems and protecting its users' data. They join ranks with other leading tech companies who have taken stern measures to combat the cyber threats posed by Trojan attacks.\n\nThis development also comes amidst a backdrop of increased corporate surveillance and the emergence of privacy issues as hot-button topics worldwide. The investigation into the Trojan by Microsoft is thus particularly significant given the company's wide-reaching global influence and its potential implications for cyber security standards worldwide. \n\nMicrosoft is expected to release further information about the detected Trojan as and when their investigation progresses. Until then, customers are advised to remain vigilant, regularly update their system defenses, and report any suspicious activity to Microsoft's security team promptly.",
    "In a major landmark of the digital age, mobile phones have now been part of our lives for two eventful decades. From the chunky devices of the late 90s to today's sleek smartphones, the evolution of the technology has utterly changed the way we communicate, work and play.\n\nThe first generation of mobile phones was launched in the 1980s, but these were mainly intended for business use. The transition to personal use began in earnest in the mid to late 90s, bringing the tech revolution to consumers' fingertips.\n\nThe way we have adopted and adapted to this technology over the past 20 years tells a remarkable story about the power of convenience and connection. Nowadays, the mobile phone serves as a personal assistant, a gaming machine, a fitness tracker, an in-pocket cinema, a research library, and much more. \n\nAccording to research, there are now around 5.20 billion unique mobile users in the world today. This figure has seen an increase of 2.4 percent compared to the previous year. \n\nThis ubiquity, however, has not been without its challenges. The same technology that allows us to connect with anyone across the globe also raises issues of cybersecurity, data privacy, and even contributes to mental health problems arising from overuse and dependence.\n\nIt has become a common sight to see people huddled over small screens in public places, tapping away at their virtual keyboards. Families at dinner tables are often distracted by pinging notifications, and mobile phones have become a constant bedside companion, staying plugged into the digital world, even when we are struggling for a good night’s sleep.\n\nThe rise of social media platforms - like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter - and other apps like Zoom, Teams, and Skype, have made mobile phones indispensable. Plus, the rise in e-commerce, banking, and money transfer services that we now rely on have morphed mobile phones into a tiny multipurpose tool that continues to evolve.\n\nYet, the potential implications on our social habits and mental health have raised concerns about how we manage our relationship with technology. The fear of missing out (FOMO) and nomophobia (fear of being without a mobile phone) are only some of recent phenomena born out of our increasing dependence.\n\nAs we stay tuned to our screens, waiting for the next call, message, or notification, it's worth reflecting on how much our lives have been shaped by mobile phones over the past 20 years. And with new advancements such as 5G, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality",
    "A fresh row has erupted over the advice given to former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. An important memo, discovered by an independent inquiry team, suggests that Blair was warned against the attack, a stark contradiction to assertions made by the former PM, inflaming a new round of discussions around the controversial decision.\n\nThe document, intended for internal circulation within the then-government, reportedly includes advice from legal experts which outlines potential ramifications of the invasion. Lawyers within the legal office of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office, argued that the attack could be classified as an “act of aggression” and contravenes sections of international law.\n\nThe fact that Blair was seemingly cautioned against the Iraq invasion blows yet another hole in the already weakened credibility of the government's decisions in the run-up to the war. Critics argue that not only did the government overlook advice stating that the reasons for invasion were unfeasible, but it now appears they ignored legal advice as well. \n\nThe former government has long claimed to have acted according to the best available advice, and with complete legitimacy. However, this recent revelation paints a different picture, adding to a string of damaging revelations that already surround the Iraq inquiry.\n\nMembers of the opposition, along with numerous legal analysts, have called for greater transparency on the decision-making processes that led up to the invasion. There have been amplified calls for an exhaustive inquiry into the reasons why such advice was allegedly sidestepped. \n\nMeanwhile, Hugh Bartol, a renowned legal scholar, has commented that ignoring such expert advice could be seen as a \"gross dereliction of duty\". Bartol said, “This raises serious questions about the judgement of those at the highest level of government, as well as the mechanisms through which crucial decisions of international importance are made.”\n\nThis fresh revelation is fueling those demanding accountability for the decision to invade Iraq, and adding fuel to calls for a comprehensive, open investigation into the details surrounding the choices made in the run-up to the war. Former government officials have yet to respond meaningfully to these allegations, instead reiterating their belief in the justness of the action.\n\nAs it stands, the full extent of the advice given to Blair at the time is still not public. As this matter unfolds, the public is left contemplating the actions of its leaders, the ramifications of the invasion, and the profound consequences of decisions made almost two decades ago.",
    "The continued rise of mobile phones combined with an increase in digital communication has led to uncertainty over the future of home phones in the UK.\n\nWhile statistics show that there has been a significant decline in home phone usage, they are still a fixture in many UK households. New data reveals that in 2020, 22% of UK adults no longer used or did not have a home phone. This is a considerable increase from 15% in 2017, according to figures released by the communications regulator, Ofcom.\n\nCommunication habits have evolved significantly over the last decade. Email, messaging apps, and video calls on platforms like Zoom and Skype have replaced traditional landline calls for many. Data from Ofcom shows that the total volume of outgoing call minutes from UK landlines fell by 50% from 2012 to 2020.\n\nThe ease of use of mobile phones and the convenience they represent make them the preferred choice for many. They also offer a range of functionalities that home phones cannot match, such as internet access, games, and social apps. This could be contributing to the decline.\n\nThe pandemic has accelerated this trend in many respects. With remote working becoming the norm for many, the need for a landline has further decreased. People are relying more on digital communication tools over traditional ones.\n\nBroadband providers have noticed the change, with many offering packages that don't involve a landline. Virgin Media, one of the UK's major broadband providers, launched a broadband-only service in 2020, enabling customers to stay connected without the need for a home phone.\n\nDespite the drastic shift, it's too soon to write the obituary for landlines. For some demographics, particularly the elderly population, home phones remain crucial. Many senior citizens find comfort and familiarity in using landlines, and for many, it remains their primary mode of communication. Text-heavy smartphones can often seem daunting and impractical for older users.\n\nMoreover, landlines provide a reliable backup for emergencies. Mobile phone services can sometimes be unstable or affected by certain geographical factors, areas of weak or no signal, whereas a landline offers a robust and stable connection, especially in rural parts of the UK.\n\nOnly time will tell if the traditional landline can regain its ground or continue its path into obsolescence. But for now, home phones continue to ring, albeit with somewhat less frequency.",
    "London-based Wembley plc has made an unexpected announcement revealing that the company will not be generating a profit this financial year. The revelation came as a surprise to investors and industry analysts who had projected a profitable year for the events management institution that had previously always maintained an upward trajectory.\n\nWembley plc, which manages the Wembley Stadium and Wembley Arena, is one of the foremost companies in event management providing locals and tourists with unforgettable entertainment experiences. Despite the company’s robust portfolio that includes globally recognised celebrities and internationally acclaimed events, the company has still faced a significant downturn.\n\nWhilst industry experts predicted a minor slump due to the ongoing pandemic affecting global tourism and events, the declaration of no profits came as a severe shock. Wembley's spokesperson stated that health restrictions had hit the company harder than anticipated which led to the cancellation of concerts, sports games and other large-scale events.\n\nThe spokesperson also highlighted that Wembley plc had to bear massive unforeseen expenses due to the modification of their operations to fit government guidelines. Wembley had to spend a significant amount on seating obstructions and additional sanitation precautions to guarantee safety, and this increased operational cost has now eaten at their profits.\n\nAnalysts believe no profit in the current financial year could potentially strain the company's cash flow and might force Wembley plc to balance its books either by laying off staff or securing liquidity through bank loans, bonds or selling assets.\n\nThe news of Wembley's financial struggle comes at a time when many businesses are grappling with losses due to the ongoing global crises caused by the pandemic. The entertainment and hospitality sectors, in particular, have been hit hardest thanks to forced cancellations and lockdowns, with many once-thriving powerhouses now teetering on the brink of solvency.\n\nThe surprising news from a stable company like Wembley plc underscores the seriousness of the current economic climate, and the potential for broader economic repercussions still looms large. With us not even halfway through the year, only time will tell if and how this cherished company, like many others, will find a way to navigate the choppy waters of these uncertain times.",
    "Stan Lee, a titan in the realm of comic books and a legendary storyteller, left an indelible mark on the industry with his uniquely human and relatable superheroes. He was often referred to as a real-life superhero himself, shaping a world filled with characters that became cultural icons and changed the landscape of American entertainment.\n\nBorn on December 28, 1922, in New York City, Lee's career spanned seven decades, from serving as an assistant at Timely Comics - a predecessor of Marvel Comics - in the 1930s to becoming Marvel's Editor-in-Chief by the 1960s. Under Lee's stewardship, Marvel launched a slew of unforgettable characters and epic storylines that were groundbreaking in their effect on popular culture.\n\nOn the canvas of paper and with the armory of words, Lee's comic book genius sprung to life through superheroes like Spiderman, Iron Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, the Incredible Hulk, Black Widow, and countless others. Unlike their god-like predecessors in the genre, these superheroes were human and flawed and, most importantly, relatable. They were individuals who, while grappling with superpowers, also dealt with everyday life problems - love, loss, anger, and disbelief.\n\nLee's approach to his characters was innovative for its time, taking a significant detour from the prevailing trope of infallible superheroes sporting capes and otherworldly personas. This touch of human realism that Lee injected into comic books changed the landscape of the genre, providing readers with characters that, despite their extraordinary abilities, they could identify with.\n\nThrough his characters, Lee also addressed critical social issues. He explored themes of racism, discrimination, and social alienity, particularly epitomised in characters like the X-Men, a group of mutant superheroes shunned by society for their differences. Through his larger-than-life characters and narratives, he also imbued valuable life lessons - bravery, honesty, responsibility, and the importance of standing up for the oppressed.\n\nLee's influence went beyond paper and ink and transcended mediums, contributing significantly to some of the highest-grossing films and series made by Hollywood in recent decades. Through collaborations with studios and filmmakers, Lee's characters and stories gained global recognition, forever transforming the cinematic landscape.\n\nHe also pioneered the \"Marvel Method\" of writing comics - a collaborative approach where Lee would detail the storyline to an illustrator, the illustrator would then craft the comic, and finally, Lee would add dialogues. This approach not only made the process more efficient but also granted more creative",
    "In response to increasing concerns over public health, the police are now urging for the authority to close pubs and bars that are found to be in violation of Covid-19 guidelines, according to the latest developments. \n\nPolice forces across the UK have reported growing frustrations as they attempt to enforce new Covid-19 restrictions. Under the proposed measures, officers would have the power to immediately shut down any pubs, bars, or other venues that are failing to comply with the UK Government's social distancing rules or other public health measures.\n\nThis proposal comes after a significant rise in Covid-19 cases in the UK, with many outbreaks linked to the hospitality sector. Representatives from different police forces have noted a growing number of establishments failing to follow Covid-19 guidelines, thus putting customers and local communities at higher risk.\n\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said the proposed powers would better equip the police to ensure public safety. A spokesperson for the NPCC stated: \"We need stronger powers to act swiftly in situations where pubs flout the rules and become unsafe.\"\n\nThe NPCC statement also revealed that currently, any Coronavirus law violations made by pubs and bars can only result in fines. However, the new set of powers would provide police with discretion to close down problematic establishments immediately, protecting public health more effectively.\n\nThere has been a mixed response to the proposal, with some stakeholders in the hospitality sector wary that it could further push already struggling businesses to the brink.\n\nThe British Beer and Pub Association said it was \"vital\" that businesses were given \"clear, precise instructions\" on the regulations, enabling them to keep their doors open while also maintaining safety measures. \n\nHowever, proponents argue that the new powers would target only a small number of venues and would not be used indiscriminately. The focus, they say, would be on penalising pubs and bars that repeatedly and flagrantly disregard Covid-19 laws, helping to safeguard the wider public from increased risk of infection.\n\nThis proposal is currently under review by the UK government, and a decision is expected in the coming days. The police continue to advise the public to avoid crowded places wherever possible and to follow safe social distancing practices.",
    "Global automotive giant Daimler AG is weathering a significant downturn in its Mercedes-Benz sector. Owing to a combination of factors, one of the biggest names associated with luxury cars globally is faced with plummeting sales and a soaring financial deficit.\n\nMercedes-Benz, the crown jewel of Germany's Daimler AG, witnessed a sharp decline in its third-quarter sales as a result of global chip shortages, supply chain disruption, and economic impacts brought about by the pandemic.\n\nAccording to reports, the shortage of semiconductors, an essential component for the manufacturing of modern cars, has crippled carmakers worldwide. Mercedes-Benz, renowned for its advanced technological integration, has been hit especially hard. \n\nThe auto-giant's projected earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) have reportedly dropped a staggering 60% compared to last year's third quarter. This fall from a previously soaring €3.07 Billion ($3.58bn) to a mere €1.2 Billion ($1.39bn) year on-year, setting alarm bells ringing at the Stuttgart-based company.\n\nThe alarming slump cannot solely be attributed to the global chip shortage. Disruptions in global trade and logistics, triggered by the pandemic, are causing supply chain blockages for automakers, undermining their ability to deliver and maintain their market position.\n\nThese problems are further amplified by an economic slowdown in key markets. China, a significant market for Mercedes-Benz, has seen slowed growth due to government regulations on its property sector, impacting its luxury goods market's development. Profitability in the North American market has also come under strain due to dealership closures prompted by the pandemic.\n\nIn an attempt to tide over these challenging times, Daimler recently announced plans to invest €40bn ($47bn) to electrify all Mercedes-Benz passenger car models by 2030. However, the immediate financial adverse effect of this slump is undeniable, with shares in Daimler falling approximately 2% on the Frankfurt exchange, consequently wiping out over €1 billion ($1.2bn) in market value.\n\nWith the economic fallout of the pandemic continuing and no immediate end in sight to the global chip shortage, Daimler AG's road to recovery may indeed be an uphill one. The automotive behemoth will need to pull out all the stops to navigate through what's shaping up to be one of the industry's most challenging periods.",

The MP represents a Midlands seat, which has traditionally swung between the two main parties. \n\nHis unexpected decision comes at a time of growing tension within the Conservative party, with disagreements over various policy matters. This includes the handling of the ongoing pandemic, the recent tax rise, and the country's approach to climate change.\n\nThe Labour leader has welcomed what he calls this 'bold and principled' decision. \"I think it shows that we in the Labour Party are offering a serious alternative to the government,” the Labour leader said.\n\nHowever, his move has not been without controversy. The local Conservative party branded the defection a “betrayal” and called for a by-election. “The public deserves the opportunity to pass judgment on this dishonourable act,” they said in a statement.\n\nDespite a potential backlash, the MP said, he believed that he was following the right path. He stated his goals to \"truly represent constituents' interests\", and said, “I can no longer do this within the confines of the Conservative party.\"\n\nIn his own statement, Prime Minister responded to the MP's defection by saying that his government was \"completely focused\" on dealing with the country's key issues. While not mentioning the MP specifically, he added that those who disagreed were \"free to choose their path\". \n\nDetails of any role the MP might play in the Labour Party, or whether he will seek re-election under their banner, have not been disclosed. Highlighting the possibility of further defections, political commentator, Alex Holmes, commented: “When one MP defects, others could well follow. This could potentially cause trouble for the prime minister.”\n\nThis move could also strengthens Labour's position in the Midlands - a region where both parties are vying for key seats ahead of the next general election. As the unexpected political saga unfolds, the nation will keenly watch further developments.",
    "Several high-profile celebrities have hunkered down in the heart of the wild jungle, as part of an upcoming reality television series, which aims to go beyond the glitz and glam of stardom to test the survival skills of these popular personalities.\n\nThe series, which remains untitled, showcases twelve celebrities striving to thrive in the rugged terrains of the Amazon Rainforest over a period of six weeks. They will face real, hands-on survival challenges, which will include building their own shelters, finding food, and staying safe in the unfamiliar environment.\n\nThe star-studded lineup includes award-winning actors, acclaimed musicians and champion athletes, all set to swap their luxurious lifestyles for a taste of raw adventure.

    "Football commentator and former professional player Graeme Souness has expressed interest in recruiting former England striker Michael Owen in the summer transfer window. Owen, a free agent since his departure from Stoke City in 2013, is yet to comment on the potential move.\n\nThis potential hiring would mark an intriguing chapter in Owen's illustrious career, which includes stints with Liverpool, Real Madrid, Newcastle United and Manchester United. Meanwhile, Souness, the former Liverpool and Rangers manager, now a respected pundit on Sky Sports, has consistently praised Owen's abilities on-air.\n\nSpeaking on Sky Sports, Souness stated, \"There aren't many players like Michael out there anymore. His eye for a goal and his ability to stay fit for a substantial part of a season, despite his age, is what makes him a valuable player.\"\n\nExperts are divided on how Owen, now 41, would fit into the competitive world of top-tier football after a long hiatus. However, Souness is confident in his abilities. \"At this stage of his life, he's not the youngster who arrived at Liverpool with bags of potential,\" Souness acknowledged, \"But he's still got the quality and experience we need.\"\n\nThe former Liverpool manager's admiration for Owen is well-documented. During their shared time at Liverpool, Souness was full of praise for the striker, whom he described as \"one of the best finishers I've ever seen\". Their enduring professional respect could be the driving force behind this potential move.\n\nDetails of the transfer, such as the duration of Owen's contract and the potential role he would play in Souness' side, remain unclear. As the transfer window approaches, fans will eagerly await confirmation of Owen's potential return to football.\n\nOwen's possible recruitment by Souness could add a stunning twist to this summer's transfer window drama, reaffirming Souness' unorthodox and determined approach to team building.\n",
    "Former world number one, Jennifer Capriati, has withdrawn from the Australian Open tennis tournament due to a persistent shoulder injury. The 36-year-old American, who won the event in 2001 and 2002, is yet to recover from a right-shoulder surgery she underwent last year.\n\nThe Women's Tennis Association confirmed the news, stating that, \"Jennifer is still in the recovery process and has not been able to achieve the ideal fitness level to compete in such a demanding tournament.\" Despite showing signs of progress, her team believes that rushing her back could potentially exacerbate her injury.\n\nCapriati's withdrawal is a blow to the tournament due to her immense popularity down under. Her comeback victory in 2002, where she came back from a set down to clinch the women's singles title, is still fondly remembered by many Australian Open fans.\n\nMaking her professional debut at the tender age of 13, Capriati quickly rose to international fame by winning the Olympic Gold for singles in Barcelona in 1992. However, her career was interrupted by personal troubles. After a six month hiatus, she made her on-court comeback in 1996 and enjoyed a steady ascending career trajectory that culminated in a world number one ranking in 2001.\n\nHer decision to pull out from the Open is in line with her history of prioritisng her health above all else. Even at the height of her career, Capriati showed the maturity to step away from the game when her physical and emotional health demanded it.\n\nThe American, who has a total of 14 singles titles to her credit, has not commented on whether this latest setback could result in her retirement from professional tennis. She had been planning to use the Australian Open as a platform to assess the state of her game ahead of a full season on the WTA Tour.\n\nHowever, it appears that tennis fans will have to wait a bit longer to witness the return of one of the sport's most inspirational figures. The Australian Open, which kicks off in Melbourne on January 15th, has yet to announce who will replace Capriati in the draw.",
    "Internet users worldwide are being urged to exercise caution when conducting online transactions, following an increase in the recorded number of internet scams. Experts, businesses and regulators are calling for concerted efforts to fight back against this growing menace.\n\nThis plea follows a report by the Internet Fraud Watchdog (IFW), which highlighted a 30 per cent rise in global cyber scams in 2021. The body is requesting governments and tech companies to intensify preventative measures, educate the public and establish tougher penalties for perpetrators.\n\nAmong the most widespread scams observed are phishing, identity theft, advanced fee fraud and bogus online auctions. Often, these scams prey upon users' lack of understanding and awareness involving the security pitfalls of digital transactions. \n\n\"Internet scams are evolving at a faster pace than our efforts to combat them,\" warns Ruth Everhart, Senior Analyst at the IFW. \"Cybercriminals are using increasingly sophisticated techniques to exploit unsuspecting victims, especially in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, where people have become more reliant on digital platforms.\"\n\nIndeed, the global shift towards remote working, online shopping and digital banking as a result of COVID-19 has seen an increased reliance on the internet - a reality not lost on cybercriminals. Many have taken advantage of these new behavioural habits and increased their fraudulent activities.\n\nSeveral prominent e-commerce websites, digital platforms and banks have joined the call for action, pledging to bolster their security systems while also emphasising user responsibility in avoiding scams.\n\nJames Kilby, Head of Cybersecurity at Thanos Bank, says, \"Even as we ramp up our security systems, users play a significant role in their own security. They need to be vigilant about suspicious emails and links, regularly update their passwords, and most importantly, stay informed about the different scamming techniques.\"\n\nCampaigners are also urging users to report scams to the authorities immediately. This helps the concerned bodies to act promptly, curbing the spread of such fraudulent activities.\n\nGovernments internationally are responding to these calls for action, launching digital literacy campaigns and tightening up anti-fraud regulations. However, the rapidly evolving nature of cybercrime represents significant challenges, presenting a need for constant updating of security systems and public awareness campaigns.\n\nWith online transactions set to grow even further, the battle against internet scams will continue to be a focal point. The synergy of efforts from the users, technology companies, businesses and governments will be crucial to keeping the digital world safe. \n\nNo one measure will be enough to eradicate this issue entirely.

    "Bookmakers have placed their bets on the critically acclaimed film \"Aviator\" as the favourite for this year's Oscar awards. Predicting the direction the Academy Awards will lean towards for Best Picture, leading bookmakers favor this epic biographical drama, almost guaranteeing its Oscar success. \n\nPowerful performances, deft direction, and an engrossing narrative have charmed not just film critics, but bookies as well who are convinced of \"Aviator's\" triumph at the 87th Academy Awards. Already the recipient of multiple awards and accolades, the film's unrelenting momentum on the prize circuit has fortified its position as the frontrunner.\n\nUK's largest betting company, Ladbrokes, has reportedly placed odds of 2-1 in favor of \"Aviator\", while Irish bookmaker Paddy Power offers slightly more conservative odds at 7-2. William Hill, another prominent British bookmaker, has also expressed similar confidence in the film's success by offering odds of 3-1.\n\nNotably, while odds can fluctuate and pre-ceremony betting doesn't ensure victory, the bookmakers' predictions have traditionally been spot-on when it comes to foreseeing Oscar winners.\n\nThe film, helmed by celebrated director Martin Scorsese, offers a compelling depiction of aviation pioneer Howard Hughes' life during the 1928–1947 period. With commanding performances by its star-studded cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role, the \"Aviator\" has been flying high ever since its release.\n\nHowever, competition is still fierce with other notable films like “Sideways”, \"Million Dollar Baby\", and \"Finding Neverland\" vying for the same prestigious award. While \"Aviator\" leads odds, surprises can never be wholly ruled out in the quest for the golden statue.\n\nThe Academy Awards, Hollywood's most awaited annual spectacle celebrating cinematic excellence, will reveal its winners in a glamorous ceremony later this year. Whether the industry experts and bookmakers have predicted right will only be answered on the much-anticipated Oscars night.\n\nWe'll all be watching to see whether the \"Aviator\" soars high above its competitors or if an underdog comes out on top.",
    "The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has expressed its disagreement with a recent decision taken by Greece's athletics body. The governing body of the athletics has confirmed that it will challenge the controversial ruling.\n\nFollowing many allegations of corruption and a series of high-profile doping scandals, Greece's athletics body had made the controversial decision to suspend various events and competitions until further reformations take place.\n\nThe IAAF, however, is firmly opposed to this blanket operation ban, stating that these steps might have profound consequences on the careers of 'clean' athletes who have no involvement in any illicit activity.\n\nThe President of the IAAF, Sebastian Coe, emphasized in a recent statement, \"We absolutely support the drive towards a cleaner, more transparent sport. However, halting all athletics events is not the solution. This penalizes innocent athletes who have dedicated their lives to the sport.\"\n\nCoe, while openly critical of the missteps in the Greek athletics body, recommended a more balanced approach. He suggested the provision of more substantial resources to fund stringent doping tests and enhance structures aimed at tackling corruption, instead of closing all competitions.\n\n\"There are many athletes in Greece who maintain the principles of fair play and the spirit of the sport. They should not lose the opportunity to display their talent and hard work because of the misdeeds by a few,\" he added.\n\nThe IAAF will be petitioning the Court of Arbitration for Sport to contest the Greek decision. The international body believes that this drastic action risks damaging the reputation of athletics globally, as well as potentially endangering the career of law-abiding athletes.\n\nSet against a backdrop of repeated instances of corruption and doping, Greece's extreme step has sent ripples throughout the athletics world. Meanwhile, the IAAF's opposition underlines its determination to protect the rights of every athlete to compete.\n\nThe forthcoming decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport will be consequential, not just for Greek athletics but also for the international athletics community. It will set a precedent on how to handle corruption and doping scandals, a growing concern in sports worldwide.",
    "In an unexpected turn of events, struggling Australian sprinter Jack Gardener has stormed to a triumphant victory, casting pre-race predictions to the wind. Despite being considered off-form due to his recent struggles with injury, Gardener arguably delivered his best performance to date.\n\nGardener, fondly known as 'The Australian Bolt', wasn't amongst the favourites to win the 200m race at the Athletics World Championships. Having spent much of the season nursing a persistent hamstring injury, his form on the track had been far from spectacular.\n\nHowever, the Australian speedster showed everyone just why he was once considered one of the brightest talents in athletics. He blasted off the blocks, claiming a lead he would never relinquish and crossing the finish line under 20 seconds, a feat only a handful of athletes can boast.\n\n\"I knew I had it in me,\" Gardener said post-race, his eyes still gleaming with the thrill of his victory. \"I've been battling injury, but never lost faith in my ability. This victory goes to my coaches, my team, and all who believed in me.\"\n\nEarlier in the year, Jack's form had been a cause for concern. Having ruled the 200m circuit domestically, this season has been one of picking up the pieces following a disappointing last-place finish at the National Trials.\n\n\"There were serious discussions about whether he could continue at this level,\" said Alan Briggs, Gardener's coach. \"But Jack's a fighter, he pulled himself together and trained harder than ever. Today's victory is a testament to his resilience.\"\n\nDoubters had written Gardener off before the race, citing his injury problems and lack in confidence as significant obstacles to his performance. But in a striking display of determination, the Australian star shrugged off all setbacks to produce a stunning run, breathing new life into his faltering career.\n\nIn a nail-biting finish, Gardener pipped American sensation Demetrius Hilson, the reigning World Champion, by 0.01 seconds. In doing so, Gardener not only gave his best performance to date, but he also set a new Australian record, firmly silencing his critics.\n\nAs he stood atop the podium, draped in the Australian flag, one could sense a shift in the air. Gardener has sent out a message loud and clear that he's far from done, and perhaps just getting started. This victory symbolises a potential comeback for the \"Off-colour\" runner and could serve as a turning point in his illustrious career.",
    "British tennis superstar Andy Murray is set to create a historic moment in the world of tennis as he has been announced to play in the 2021 Davis Cup. This prestigious event will mark Murray's twelfth participation, making him the British player with the most appearances in the tournament's history.\n\nMurray, ranked third in the world, has been an iconic figure in British tennis for many years, claiming three Grand Slam titles, two Olympic gold medals, and initiating a crucial role in the GB team's 2015 Davis Cup victory. \n\nThe British player has been an essential element of the Davis Cup team since his debut in 2005. He has guided the country to numerous victories and incredibly climactic matches that fans worldwide will remember for years to come.\n\nBritish Tennis Captain, Leon Smith, underlined what this means saying, \"Andy's record speaks for itself, and it's a proud moment for him and British tennis. His dedication and contribution to the team is commendable. We're incredibly lucky to have a player of his calibre representing us.\"\n\nMurray, despite dealing with physical setbacks, including hip surgery in 2019, has shown notable determination to get back to his peak. His commitment to the sport and his determination to continually improve is what sets him apart, maintaining his place amongst the top-ranked players in the world.\n\n\"It's an honour to be representing Great Britain again. The Davis Cup has always held a special place in my heart, and I'm excited to be making history with my twelfth appearance,\" Murray stated during an interview.\n\nWith Murray at the reins, there is immense anticipation moving forward for Great Britain at the Davis Cup this year. The tournament will kick off in Madrid on November 25, and supporters worldwide cannot wait to see Murray take the court and potentially guide his nation to another remarkable victory.\n\nThe potential implications of this tournament are massive, not just for Murray's individual career, but also for the future of British tennis. Indeed, this historic participation could be the catalyst for more significant milestones in the sport.",
    "Chancellor Gordon Brown has announced that petrol duties will be held static, in a move cheered by motorists and retail associations. The announcement comes amid rising fuel costs and inflation worries.\n\nMr. Brown reassured millions of drivers across the country that fuel duties would be frozen for the remainder of the current fiscal year. This decision comes in the wake of significantly escalating petrol prices, which have placed considerable economic pressure on drivers, businesses and consumers alike.\n\nThe Chancellor explained the freeze as part of a larger effort to cushion the UK economy against the impacts of international oil price fluctuations. The UK's fuel duty, one of the highest in the world, has been a controversial topic for years. However, according to Mr. Brown, this freeze will ensure that drivers are not unduly burdened during these volatile economic times.\n\n\"The government is committed to helping British motorists - particularly during these times of economic uncertainty,\" said Mr. Brown. “The freeze in fuel duty will help family budgets and businesses across the Country.”\n\nPetrol retailers and driver associations have welcomed the announcement saying it brought much-needed relief. The Freight Transport Association described it as a \"fragile lifeline\" for struggling hauliers who are grappling with the impact of soaring fuel costs on their operations.\n\nMeanwhile, environmental groups have expressed concern that the freeze on fuel duty could discourage the necessary shift towards more environmentally friendly modes of transport.\n\nThis announcement came as a surprise to some, as Mr. Brown, in his March budget, had originally planned to increase petrol taxes by 2p per litre beginning from September. However, given record fuel prices and the ongoing cost of living concerns, the chancellor decided to hold off on implementing this potential rise.\n\nThe chancellor concluded his announcement by reiterating the government's commitment to a fair and balanced approach to economic policy - protecting the interests of consumers, businesses, and the environment.",
    "Protesters are gearing up to stage a significant demonstration at one of the UK's major airports. The demonstration, planned for the coming weeks, is anticipated to disrupt the airport's regular operations, aiming to draw attention to the protesters' cause.\n\nThe protest is being co-ordinated by numerous environmental groups who are collectively aiming to challenge the airport's expansion plans. They have consistently expressed concerns that increased air traffic will significantly contribute to climate change due to higher greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe airport, which has asked not to be named for security reasons, has recently announced plans to build a new runway to cater to the increasing demand. The expansion plan has provoked a fierce response from environmental activists who cite the harmful effects of air travel on the environment and the need for alternative transport modes.\n\nGreen Earth United, one of the main environmental organisations leading the protest, says it's not a decision they have taken lightly. \"We comprehend the inconvenience our protest might cause to travelers, but we firmly believe that the long-term effects of airport expansion pose a greater threat,\" said a spokesperson for the group.\n\nThe protesters have promised that their demonstration will be peaceful and are preparing to face arrests if necessary. They plan on employing non-violent civil disobedience tactics, such as blocking roads leading to the airport and staging sit-ins at the terminals.\n\nAirport authorities have expressed their concern regarding the potential disruption to their services and the impact it may have on passengers. They reassured the public that they are working closely with the police to ensure the safety and minimal disruption for passengers.\n\nA representative from the airport said, \"While we respect the right to peaceful protest and agree on the urgency of addressing climate change, we cannot allow any actions that might put the safe and smooth operation of the airport at risk.\"\n\nThe proposed protest is part of a series of actions by climate activists across the country demanding the government take more drastic measures to combat climate change. As the day of the protest draws closer, it remains to be seen how this confrontation between environmental protestors and airport authorities will unfold.",
    "Gold prices have seen a substantial decline amid worries that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) might sell part of its gold reserves, a move that could potentially flood the market and lower the value of the yellow metal.\n\nLast trading session saw the price of spot gold falling by 0.6% to $1,820 per ounce, reversing gains made earlier in the week. US gold futures also dropped 0.7% at $1,822.40.\n\nThe drop in prices comes after speculation that the IMF might resort to sell its gold amid the COVID-19 pandemic to support struggling economies. The IMF holds a total of 2,814 metric tonnes of gold at designated depositories, making it one of the largest institutional holders of gold in the world.\n\n\"The markets are reacting to speculations about a potential IMF gold sale, leading to a sell-off\", said Xiao Fu, Head of Commodity Market Strategy at Bank of China International. \"However, an actual sale is complicated and could take time due to the requirement of approval by the IMF board.\"\n\nThe bullion market was further weighed down by an advancing dollar, which makes gold more expensive for holders of other currencies. The dollar index, measuring the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.2% on Friday.\n\nDespite these pressures, analysts are optimistic for gold's long-term outlook. \"Gold remains a long-term buy. Central banks are still accommodative, and real interest rates remain negative. Once these IMF sale rumours are digested, gold prices should lift again,\" said Michael Langford, executive director at corporate advisory and consultancy firm AirGuide.\n\nYet, experts also warn that short-term fluctuations in gold prices are common due to speculation and macroeconomic uncertainties. Investors are therefore urged to exercise prudence and maintain a diversified portfolio.\n\nThe IMF's touted sale is not without precedent. In 2009-2010, it sold over 400 metric tonnes of gold, citing a similar reason of supporting member countries. The decision had significant implications for the global bullion market, contributing to a moderate fall in prices. However, market scale, liquidity and demand dynamics have changed since and it remains to be seen what impact a similar move would yield now.",
    "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has confirmed that it has approved additional financial assistance for Turkey, a move seen as a crucial attempt to support the country's struggling economy. \n\nThe disbursement, the amount of which has not yet been disclosed, will be primarily allocated towards infrastructure development, addressing economic vulnerabilities, and promoting sustainable growth. However, critics suggest it could also result in austerity measures. \n\nIn spite of a rapidly deteriorating economy exacerbated by ongoing geopolitical tensions, Turkey has not received IMF aid since 2008. The new agreement therefore marks a significant shift in policy both for the country and the international lender.\n\nActing IMF Managing Director, Tao Zhang, highlighted in the announcement that the decision aims to assist Turkey in facing its economic challenges. \"It is more important than ever to strengthen Turkey's economy. This financial assistance will not only boost the country's economic stability, but also help to address inflation and unemployment problems,\" said Zhang.\n\nThe deal comes after lengthy discussions between the Turkish government and the international lender, demonstrating the increasing concern over the state of the Turkish economy, which has staggered under high inflation, struggling market confidence, and a plummeting lira over the past few years.\n\nDespite the positive responses from international observers, the IMF's decision is not without criticisms. Some fear that the loan could lead to harsh austerity measures, as repayment conditions might impose severe fiscal curbs on the Turkish government.\n\nWhile detailing the funding’s focus areas, the IMF also stressed the necessity of comprehensive structural reforms, including enhancing transparency, fighting corruption, and improving business practices.\n\nTurkey's Finance Minister Lutfi Elvan stated that the country was \"committed to the implementation of these economic reforms.\"\n\n\"The Turkish government appreciates the IMF’s financial support. We assure that these resources will be efficiently managed to achieve their intended objectives,\" said Elvan.\n\nWith the global economy facing pandemic-induced uncertainties, Turkey hopes the new funding will contribute to stabilising the state economy and its eventual recovery.",
    "Ringtones sellers are to face stringent new regulations in an effort to clamp down on unscrupulous practices and protect consumers, under new rules announced by the UK telecoms regulator. The move follows a significant rise in complaints from mobile phone users about excessive costs and hidden charges.\n\nThe Ofcom regulator has said that the new rules will strongly regulate the ringtone industry, which had previously operated with relative freedom. This follows an alarming increase in the number of complaints arising from misleading advertisements, unclear subscription terms and inflated costs. \n\nIn many cases, users reported being lured into expensive monthly subscriptions for ringtones without their explicit agreement or understanding of the terms. Several phone users also claimed to have been billed for ringtones and other mobile services that were never used or delivered.\n\nTo tackle this, Ofcom is set to introduce a number of stringent rules aimed at making sure consumers are not hoodwinked by unscrupulous companies or complex terms and conditions. The regulator’s new guidelines stipulate that pricing information for any ringtone service must be clearly provided to the user at the point of purchase. In addition, firms will need to take steps to ensure that customers are fully aware they have entered into a recurring payment situation.\n\nUnder the new rules, advertising and marketing communications from these companies must also be honest and transparent. They should not mislead the consumers or omit important information about the cost of the service or the duration of the contract. \n\nA new rule that may give further relief to the customers is the 'cooling-off' period. Companies will now be required to offer a minimum 14-day 'cooling-off' period during which customers can cancel their purchase without being charged. \n\nIn a statement, Ofcom said that the protection of consumers is a priority. “We will fully investigate complaints and take robust action where necessary,\" a spokesperson added. The regulations will come into effect two months from now.\n\nThis move by Ofcom is viewed as a welcome step towards greater transparency in how digital services are offered and sold, putting an end to misleading practices that have left many consumers out of pocket over the years in the UK. \n\nWhile this new regulation is shaking up the ringtone industry, it is expected that other mobile and tech-related sectors might also come under similar scrutiny in near future. This could result in wider transparency and better protection for mobile users in the UK.",
    "Mobile operators in Turkey and Iran may have to abandon discussions over a multi-million dollar connectivity agreement, amid rising geopolitical tensions and fears over data security. \n\nThe potential deal, concerning roaming services between all Turkish and Iranian mobile operators, is reportedly worth an estimated £180m ($250m). However, insiders highlight ongoing political discord and increased concern over data sharing as primary reasons for stalling talks. \n\nThe proposed agreement aimed to provide cheaper and easier mobile connectivity for millions of users frequently travelling between the two nations. Several Turkish operators have significant investments in Iran's mobile industry, and the deal was seen as a way to strengthen the ties between the networks. \n\n\"Geopolitical instabilities are causing us to reconsider engaging in such deals right now,\" a senior official from one of Turkey's leading mobile networks informed on the condition of anonymity. Moreover, concerns about Iranian authorities potentially having access to user data further dampens the enthusiasm. \"Data security is paramount, and we must protect our customers' information,\" the official added. \n\nHowever, Iranian authorities claim they are not intending to misuse any subscriber information. They suggest that the operators' concerns are merely a way to stall negotiations and gain a more favourable position in the deal. \n\nWere the deal to collapse, it would deal a major blow to Iran's ambitious plans to attract foreign investment for its telecommunications infrastructure development. It could also deal a financial blow to Turkish operators, who have been rapidly expanding their presence in Iran since international sanctions were lifted in 2015. \n\nMeanwhile, customers who travel between the two countries could face higher call rates and data prices if an agreement cannot be reached. As per international mobile coverage costs, phone usage can skyrocket in countries without established roaming agreements. \n\nThe negotiations come at a time when global tensions are mounting over Iran's nuclear capabilities and Turkish political disputes. These geopolitics have permeated the business space, causing uncertainties and hesitations in investments and deals, including the mobile agreement.\n\nBoth countries are yet to officially withdraw from discussions, leaving it unclear as to whether talks will continue or come to a conclusive end. For now, the fate of the multi-million pound deal hangs in the balance amidst growing uncertainty and regional tensions. \n\nThe broader implications of the suspension of this deal could signify retreating collaboration in the technology sector between countries facing political disagreements. Investors and technology firms will continue to watch the evolution of the situation carefully.",
    "Algeria continues to witness escalating unrest as gas shortages provoke fresh riots across several towns, resulting in major disorder and clashes between rioters and security forces.\n\nThousands of Algerians took to the streets after shortages in cooking gas and fuel prompted frustration and anger among citizens, who are already grappling with rising inflation and the economic fallout from the ongoing global pandemic.\n\nThe situation escalated rapidly as angry protesters started to blockade roads, set tires on fire, and chant anti-government slogans. Demonstrators clashed with national police and gendarmerie in several areas, who reportedly responded with tear gas and began conducting mass arrests to subdue the protests.\n\nThe worst-hit areas include the capital, Algiers, where large crowds gathered outside gas stations that had run dry, while in northern towns such as Tizi Ouzou, scores of young men blocked highways with burning tires, exacerbating an already precarious situation.\n\nThis is not the first episode of such tension in the North African nation. Gas shortages, aggravated by a decrease in oil production and exacerbated by government mismanagement and corruption, have been a recurrent issue causing public outrage. The ongoing crisis has amplified resentment against the government, accused of incompetence and neglect towards citizens' basic needs.\n\nGovernment officials acknowledge the crisis but blame it on a combination of reduced gas production, logistic issues, and increased demand due to the changing seasonal weather. They pledged to normalize the situation within a few days, but such promises were met with skepticism by a weary public.\n\nThe shortage crisis has exposed the vulnerability of Algeria's economy, which heavily relies on fossil fuels, making it extremely susceptible to fluctuations in global oil and gas markets. This recurrent crisis only intensifies the calls for urgent economic reforms and diversification of the country's fossil fuel-dependent economy.\n\nAlgeria, a significant gas supplier to Europe, has seen its oil and gas revenues plunge in recent years due to lower global prices and its failure to bolster its non-energy sector. The fiscal crisis has undermined the Algerian government's ability to maintain subsidized prices for essential commodities, including gas, resulting in periodic shortages over the past few years.\n\nAnalysts worry about the potential for further escalation, recalling the widespread protests that shook Algeria in 2019 and led to the ousting of long-standing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. If not addressed promptly and effectively, this gas shortage may lead to even broader civil unrest and political instability within the economically troubled nation. \n\nInternational stakeholders will be eyeing the situation with caution, given Algeria's strategic position as a major gas supplier and a key player in regional",
    "Microsoft has announced a unique strategy to combat the piracy problem. Users of pirated copies of their Windows XP software have been offered a new legitimate copy, in an attempt to stamp out widespread software theft.\n\nThe amnesty will only apply to customers who have purchased high-grade counterfeit copies, not plain copies of Windows XP sold at a cheap price. The company stated that it would not levy any penalty or attempt to trace back the seller but has expressed a keen interest in receiving information about where the counterfeit copy was purchased.\n\nThe initiative is part of the company's Genuine Software Initiative, aimed at educating people about the risks and potential problems associated with using pirated software. It further deems to highlight the security risks of a non-genuine software that may put users at risk to viruses, malware, and other potentially harmful cyber threats.\n\nAlex Hilton, Licence Compliance Manager at Microsoft UK, said, \"The risk of using counterfeit software is that it often contains viruses or, even worse, spyware that can steal sensitive personal information.\"\n\nOver the past few years, Microsoft has introduced several measures to curtail the extensive trade in counterfeit versions of its software. In conjunction with the law enforcement agencies worldwide, Microsoft has done countless raids and legal actions against pirated software traders.\n\nWhile the move could cost the software giant millions, it's viewed as a small price to pay to elevate Windows XP's piracy problem. Ideally, it's a forward-looking decision that values the Windows ecosystem's long-term integrity more than short-term profit.\n\nThe strategy predominantly applies to users in the UK, US, and some parts of Europe. Users will have to provide evidence that their copy is counterfeit to qualify for the swap.\n\nExperts view this move by Microsoft as a significant enforcement strategy - one that puts customer safety first and could help wipe out the persistent issue of software piracy effectively.\n\nThe offer is not limitless, however. The offer's expiry date is not mentioned, but Microsoft has suggested that the programme could be reviewed and potentially terminated depending on its effectiveness. The company also retains the right to refuse applications, specifically in cases where it believes piracy has been deliberate.",

    "In a groundbreaking move, giant pandas living in China's research centres and reserves are reaping the benefits of a new wireless network technology. This new venture aims to improve both welfare and conservation efforts for the endangered species.\n\nAt the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, wireless network technology has been used to provide the pandas with more freedom, improve their living conditions, and aid in vital research efforts. This IT-based strategy is a testament to China's growing reliance on technology for research purposes and the advancement of animal conservation. \n\nThe system utilises wireless sensor networks (WSNs), equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, to monitor panda activity continuously. The real-time data obtained on pandas' movements, activities, and general well-being through GPS tracking offers unparalleled insights into their daily lives.\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of this system is the non-invasive method of collecting valuable data that can inform on pandas' health status and behavioural patterns. Preliminary findings from the network have helped in identifying new data on pandas' mating approaches, dietary habits, and migration patterns, all crucial aspects of panda conservation efforts.\n\nAdditionally, not only does this system have the potential to reduce human interference in the pandas' lives, but it also allows scientists more excellent bandwidth to monitor several pandas simultaneously. It can potentially contribute to better disease detection due to the continuous monitoring, leading to earlier, more effective intervention.\n\nDigital tools have increasingly become essential for wildlife conservation efforts. Soon, this wireless technology span could further extend to other endangered species across China and beyond. \n\nProject lead Dr. Li Bin stated, \"This technology not only provides us with a wealth of information about pandas, but it's also an insight into how advanced tracking devices and wireless networks can revolutionise the way we approach wildlife conservation.\"\n\nThere are hopes for the further refinement and expansion of this breakthrough technology, implementable across various research bases worldwide. If successful, this modern approach to animal monitoring could redefine future efforts in animal conservation and welfare. \n\nAs we continue to see advancements in technology play out in various sectors of our lives, it is heartening to see it being harnessed in positive, impactful ways to better understand and protect the world's wildlife.",
    "In a significant development that's likely to impact thousands of workers, an imminent deal on the purchase of the Rover Car Group might lead to job losses of up to 2,000, according to industry insiders. \n\nThe Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), China's largest car manufacturer, is widely reported to be in advanced negotiations to purchase a controlling stake in the iconic British car firm. The Rover Car Group has been battling declining sales and intense competition in an increasingly crowded market. \n\nIf the sale goes through, industry analysts predict a significant restructuring and downsizing operation which could result in the loss of up to 2,000 jobs at Rover's Longbridge factory near Birmingham. Though both parties have refused to officially comment on the deal, fears are increasing over job security among the workforce.\n\nWhile it is understood that SAIC would plan to continue production of Rover cars in the UK, the focus would likely shift towards the more profitable models. This could result in the scaling back of certain production lines, potentially leading to significant job cuts.\n\nLongbridge, once the largest car factory in the world, currently employs around 6,000 workers. A loss of 2,000 jobs would therefore amount to around one-third of the workforce. Such a significant reduction could have major ramifications for the local economy, with the potential for knock-on effects on businesses and services in the surrounding area.\n\nThe Unite union, which represents many Rover workers, called the potential job losses \"heartbreaking\". A spokesman said: \"Our members have given their lives to this company. To hear that one-third of the workforce could potentially be made redundant is an enormous blow.\"\n\nThe Rover Car Group and representatives from SAIC have maintained silence about the speculation around the potential job cuts. However, if such significant layoffs were to occur, it would be a vast departure from previous assurances given by SAIC about its commitment to securing British jobs. \n\nFor now, the workers can only watch and wait as negotiations continue between the Chinese manufacturer and troubled British carmaker. With the possibility of substantial layoffs looming, many are fearing the worst, even as they hope for the best.\n",
    "Calisto Tanzi, the founder of Italian diary company Parmalat, has extended a public apology in the wake of the firm’s billion-euro bankruptcy scandal. Tanzi, who was the Chief Executive Officer of the multinational food corporation, appeared to be visibly remorseful for what has been dubbed as 'Europe's Enron.' \n\n\"I am sorry for what happened,\" Tanzi said during the hearing of his appeal against the 10-year jail sentence handed to him three years ago for financial fraud. The Parmalat scandal, which unfolded in 2003, has been touted as one of Europe's biggest bankruptcy scandals, leaving 135,000 investors broke and shaking up the international financial community.\n\nParmalat declared bankruptcy in 2003 after it was found that €4bn ($5bn; £3.65bn) thought to be held by a Cayman Islands subsidiary didn't exist. Tanzi was accused of covering up the hole in the corporate finances with a false document indicating the non-existing funds.\n\nThis marked one of the biggest accounting fraud scandals in the world. In the wake of Parmalat's collapse, the Italian government was compelled to swiftly enact measures in order to protect small-scale investors hit by the bankruptcy scandal. \n\nTanzi continued, \"I thought I was doing well for Parmalat, for the employees, for the community that with Parmalat has developed and grown. Unfortunately, things didn't go as I had foreseen.\" Tanzi thus not only acknowledged his wrongdoing but took full responsibility for his actions leading to the scandal.\n\nThe sentencing of Tanzi in 2014 marked the end of a labyrinthine, decade-long trial that involved more than 50 people, including lawyers, accountants, and bankers who were associated with the scandal. \"This action doesn't erase what has happened, but it does prove that even those on top can be held accountable for their financial misdeeds,\" read a statement from the Italian Consumer Association.\n\nTanzi's apparent remorse has, however, not relieved Parmalat's creditors, who are yet to recover their investments. Parmalat has since been bought by France's Lactalis group and continues to operate globally.\n",
    "Beginning to recover from a long period of economic instability, Liberia has shown a significant increase in economic growth, according to recent economic indicators. The West African nation's growth is largely due to a resurgence in the commodities market, encouraging foreign direct investment, and key policy changes.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) confirmed these positive indicators, stating that Liberia's economy had grown by about 3.2% in the last year, a major improvement from previous years which had seen little to no growth. The IMF praised the country's fiscal management and economic rebuilding initiatives as a driving force behind this economic growth.\n\nThe Liberian government's structural adjustments, coupled with international assistance, have been instrumental in realizing this growth. In particular, successful policy implementation has stimulated foreign investments in key sectors like mining, agriculture, and forestry.\n\nReforms in Liberia have aimed to diversify the economy and build resilience against external shocks. Simultaneously, the government has focused on reducing barriers to business, effecting tariff reductions, and improving the overall business climate. These endeavours have roots in President George Manneh Weah’s Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development, which has been key to drawing in investment and inspiring economic confidence.\n\nLiberia's Minister for Finance and Development Planning, Samuel D. Tweah, Jr. noted that the country is on the right track. \"This growth signals a positive direction for our economy. It’s important that we maintain this momentum through continuous reforms and building on our policy strengths\", the Minister said.\n\nSignificant investment has been seen in mining, a prominent function of Liberia's economy. The resurgence of the commodities industry has played a big part in fuelling economic growth. Other sectors like agriculture- especially the production of rubber, palm oil, and cocoa- have also shown impressive growth figures.\n\nResilient amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Liberia’s firm and coordinated policy response has been successful in minimizing the economic disruption. With its prime focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability, Liberia is moving towards fiscal sustainability.\n\nDespite this positive growth, the country still has enormous economic hurdles to overcome. The IMF has advocated for further reform, calling for greater investment in health, education, and social protection. Whilst Liberia’s economy has started growing positively, the challenge lies in ensuring that this growth is inclusive and sustainable and lifts many Liberians out of poverty.\n\nOverall, this economic progress is a noteworthy step in Liberia's journey towards sustainable growth, reducing poverty, and achieving shared prosperity. With solid effort and strategic planning, Liberia could become a significant contender",
    "Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has expressed his confidence in the club's younger players, stating that the team's future success hinges on their development and ability to respond to pressure.\n\nA stalwart of the game and the man who led Manchester United to numerous victories during his 26-year tenure, Ferguson is recognised globally for his ability to nurture young talent. He is known for his role in developing the famous \"Class of '92\" – the group of young players that included David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville, who went on to become superstars under his guidance.\n\nIn an interview, Ferguson emphasised the importance of young talent in the club. He said, \"They are the future. The club has always put its faith in young players and it's up to them to seize the opportunity\".\n\n\"In my opinion, their dedication, ambition and ability to handle pressure will play a significant role in the club's success or failure over the coming seasons,\" he added.\n\nFerguson, 79, who retired as manager in 2013 but remains a director at Old Trafford, furthermore expressed particular excitement about Mason Greenwood, Brandon Williams, and Scott McTominay. He praised them for their potential, describing them as possessing that \"Manchester United DNA\".\n\n\"Mason, Brandon, Scott – they've shown fantastic potential and what we call that United DNA. They've been here from a young age, learnt the values, and these lads have got a great opportunity ahead,\" he said.\n\nHe also pointed out their remarkable progression, playing regularly in first team fixtures, and with Mason Greenwood in particular grabbing headlines for his scoring abilities. \n\nHowever, Ferguson warned against unrealistic expectations, saying, \"You can't expect them to perform miracles overnight. They need time, the right guidance, and a supportive environment. But I have faith they will deliver.\"\n\nFerguson's comments were welcomed by the club, with a spokesperson stating, \"Sir Alex is a legend at the club and his continued support and faith in our younger players means a great deal. His experience and wisdom are invaluable resources for our players.\"\n\nThe faith in youth has been a linchpin in the philosophy of Manchester United since the days of Sir Matt Busby. These remarks from a true club legend like Ferguson highlight that the tradition continues and further underscores the importance of youth development at the club.\n",

The British actor will receive the Golden Bear for Lifetime Achievement on 10th February at the city’s iconic Palast Berlin. \n\nAccording to festival's director, Alfred Bauer, \"Daniel Day-Lewis has left an indelible mark on cinema with his extraordinary capacity for transformation. His characters are unforgettable and have earned him his place amongst the greatest actors of our time. This award will be a tribute to his exceptional talent and contribution to the world of cinema.”\n\nDay-Lewis, 64, has built an illustrious career marked by depths of commitment and exceptional talent. He has delivered powerful performances across a wide range of film genres, gaining a reputation for deeply embodying his characters. Notably, he is the only male actor in history to have three wins in the Best Actor category at the Academy Awards. His Oscar victories include performances in 'My Left Foot' (1989), 'There Will Be Blood' (2007), and 'Lincoln' (2012).\n\nThe actor is known for his meticulous preparation for roles and his selective approach towards film projects. Despite having a relatively small filmography compared to his contemporaries, his impact on the global film industry is widely recognised. \n\nThis is not the first time the actor has been recognised at the Berlin International Film Festival. He previously won a Silver Bear for Best Actor for his role in ‘In the Name of the Father’ in 1994.\n\nDay-Lewis announced his retirement from acting in 2017 after the release of his film, ‘Phantom Thread.’ The festival's recognition can, therefore, be seen as a celebration of his significant contributions to acting over a remarkable 40 years career. \n\nIn response to the news, the widely-respected actor expressed his gratitude and honour at receiving the award. \"I am honoured and delighted by this recognition from the Berlin International Film Festival,\" Day-Lewis said. “It’s always lovely to receive an award, but this one is particularly special due to my deep affection for the festival and the city it calls home.\"\n\nThis year's Berlin International Film Festival is scheduled to take place from 10th-20th February.

    "Renowned tycoon Cameron Jones has initiated legal action against internationally acclaimed Italian businessman, Antonio Conte, escalating a recent dispute between the two magnates. \n\nJones, the executive of the multi-billion Jones Corporation, has reportedly taken the step to file for the lawsuit in what marked a dramatic twist in their long-standing business relationship. The complaint alleges gross misconduct and breaches of contractual obligations.\n\nThe allegations centre on Conte's alleged failure to deliver on various financial commitments tied to a joint venture between the two tycoons. Mr. Jones contends that Conte's alleged actions have caused substantial financial damage to his business, for which he expects compensation.\n\nDespite maintaining a robust business alliance for numerous years, Conte and Jones have found their partnership in crisis over allegations of mistrust and financial impropriety. The proceedings are expected to reveal long-held grudges and financial discrepancies at the heart of their joint venture.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed yesterday in the London High Court, marks a significant downturn in a professional relationship once hailed as a \"model partnership\". The case will shed new light on the opaque mechanics of high-stakes international business.\n\nA statement from Jones' legal representative confirmed, \"Mr. Jones has reluctantly initiated litigation proceedings, further to various infractions on the part of Mr. Conte. It is with deep regret and ahead of preferred amicable resolutions that we find our client compelled to take such steps.\"\n\nIn response, Conte’s legal team issued a statement, saying \"Mr. Conte categorically denies any wrongdoings and will vigorously defend his reputation. He has always conducted all his business relationships with utmost honesty and integrity.”\n\nWith both sides gearing up for a potentially arduous legal battle, the Jones versus Conte saga is sure to make headlines. Legal experts suggest it will likely evolve into a high-profile illustration of the turbulence within the corporate world. \n\nThe hearing date is yet to be scheduled. Until then, it's watching and waiting for the rest of the world as these corporate giants go head-to-head.",
    "The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the country's largest bank by assets, has reported a significant increase in profit. ICBC earned a net profit of 286.05bn yuan ($42bn; £32bn) for the year of 2020, a rise of 4.1% compared to the same period in the previous year.\n\nThis increase in profitability comes despite the economic turbulence caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which plunged most of the world's economies into recession. The Chinese economy, however, has shown resilience and is the only major economy in the world that expanded in 2020.\n\nAnalysts attribute ICBC's resilient performance to China's swift recovery from the pandemic, aided by the Chinese government's rapid response in terms of hefty stimulus packages and rigorous measures to control the spread of the virus, as well as strong domestic demand.\n\n\"Banks have been vital in securing health in the Chinese economy. Their role in dispersing funds to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which were hit hard by the pandemic, has proven instrumental for the overall recovery,\" said Hong Hao, a Beijing-based economist.\n\nAdditionally, the bank reported a decrease in bad loans, which helped to boost its profitability. The bank's non-performing loan ratio stood at 1.38% at the end of December, down from 1.43% at the end of September.\n\nDespite the buoyant results, the banking sector in China is bracing itself for potential difficulties in the future. The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has cautioned commercial banks about the risk of a potential increase in non-performing loans this year, and urged financial institutions to increase their capital buffers.\n\nAs China's top lender, the ICBC's performance bodes well for other banks in the country. Other major banks such as Bank of China and China Construction Bank are yet to report their annual results, but the boost in profits for ICBC may indicate a similar trend for them.\n\nThe ICBC, which is one of the 'Big Four' state-owned commercial banks in China, also announced plans for further international expansion. It aims to strengthen the cooperation with its overseas institutions and accelerate the development of its business overseas. \n\nIn 2020, ICBC expanded its global network to 47 countries and regions, providing various financial services to more than 7,500 Chinese enterprises going global and serving over 143 million individual customers worldwide.",
    "Markets are signalling a recovery in Brazil, according to recent economic data, boosting investor confidence and indicating a potential turnaround for the country’s struggling economy. This comes amidst a backdrop of political instability and management challenges, highlighting the resilience of the largest economy in Latin America.\n\nRecent reports reveal that the Bovespa index, Sao Paulo’s benchmark stock index, has risen significantly. Additionally, Brazil’s currency, the Real has appreciated against the US dollar suggesting that economic recovery might be underway.\n\nLocal markets, that had previously been impacted heavily by corruption scandals and political uncertainty, are now seemingly buoyed by structural reforms, better governance practices, and an optimistic business outlook. \n\nThe impressive rally in the stock market has been led by large corporations, particularly in the energy, finance, and consumer goods sectors, with Petrobras, Itaú Unibanco, and Ambev demonstrating particularly robust performance. \n\nA major factor contributing to this optimistic economic recovery is Brazil's government driving an ambitious slate of economic reforms including a significant privatization program. These reforms target to overhaul the pension and tax systems, reduce government spending, and attract international investment.\n\n“The reforms carried out by the government have brought a noticeable change in Brazil’s economy,” says Paulo Leme, an economist at Goldman Sachs. \"It has restored investors' faith in the market and has put Brazil back onto the roadmap for potential investors.\"\n\nDespite this growth, economists have warned not to ignore the possibility of potential setbacks. For one, Brazil is still dealing with issues like unemployment and inflation. However, they are cautiously optimistic that with continued reforms, Brazil’s economic recovery should continue its upward trajectory.\n\nThe improvement in the market performance has further boosted international interest in Brazil. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has been steadily ticking up, indicating that international investors are taking note of Brazil’s improving business climate.\n\n\"Although there is still a long way to go, the significant growth in markets indicates that the worst may indeed be over for Brazil. The enormous potential of the Brazilian economy cannot be underestimated and it has shown great resilience in the face of adversity,\" said Roberto Campos Neto, the chairman of Brazil’s central bank. \n\nThe markets' positive response suggests Brazil is slowly emerging from its economic slump, providing a glimmer of hope to other struggling economies across the region and potentially indicating a more widespread economic recovery in Latin America.",
    "Global alcohol beverage giant, Diageo, has announced plans to expand its portfolio with the purchase of a prominent US wine company. While the name of the wine firm has not been officially disclosed, the acquisition is part of Diageo's strategy to strengthen its foothold in the fine wines sector.\n\nDiageo, the British multinational company known for brands like Johnnie Walker, Tanqueray and Guinness, is the world's largest producer of spirits and a major player in beer and wine. This move sees the company making a significant investment in its wine portfolio.\n\nThe acquisition demonstrates Diageo's ambition to tap into the growing wine market in the United States, which represents the world's largest wine-consuming country by volume, according to the Wine Institute. Furthermore, experts forecast the US wine market to increase over the next few years, creating positive business prospects for Diageo.\n\n\"By acquiring a renowned US wine firm, we aim to exploit the increasing trend toward premium products among American consumers,\" said a spokesperson for Diageo. \"It gives us a fantastic opportunity to significantly broaden our wine offering and to expand our customer base.\"\n\nAnalysts believe the acquisition will allow Diageo to strengthen its position in the competitive alcohol beverage industry.

    "In a bid to clear his name, former Worldcom boss, Bernard Ebbers, has launched a vehement defense in the face of charges linked to one of the biggest corporate frauds in U.S. history. Mr. Ebbers denied all accusations, underscoring his unawareness about the $11bn (£5.7bn) accounting fraud during his time as WorldCom's CEO.\n\nStanding trial in New York, Ebbers pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy. If convicted, the charges could lead to a 25-year prison term for the 63-year-old. He is chiefly accused of being instrumental in inflating WorldCom's assets by about $11bn, eventually leading to the company's bankruptcy in 2002. \n\nIn his defense, Ebbers emphasised his lack of expertise in accounting. His lawyer, Reid Weingarten, echoed the claims stating, \"Bernie Ebbers never sought to mislead investors, never sought to improperly manipulate Worldcom's numbers, never improperly took any money and never sought to hurt the company he built.\"\n\nThe prosecution team, however, countered this defense by presenting former WorldCom financial director, Scott Sullivan, as their star witness. Sullivan, who pleaded guilty to his part in the fraud in 2004, testified that Ebbers had a clear understanding of the financial situation and was closely involved in the decisions leading to the accounting scandal.\n\nThe collapse of WorldCom was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. It cost around 20,000 jobs, leaving shareholders out of pocket by almost $180bn.\n\nWorldCom, now rebranded as MCI, has since been bought by telecoms giant Verizon. The audit failure at the company led to significant changes in U.S. regulatory laws with the introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, aimed at tightening corporate accountability.\n\nThe trial continues.\n",

Israeli Prime Minister and the Egyptian President both highlighted the potential of the deal to usher in increased stability and prosperity in the region.\n\n\"In the spirit of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence, we are ushering in a new era of economic cooperation that would bring significant benefit to people of both countries,\" said the Israeli Prime Minister during the conference.\n\nThe Egyptian President echoed this sentiment, stating that \"courageous steps must be taken to establish a lasting peace and mutual growth in the region. Today we have taken one such step.\"\n\nThe details reveal that the landmark trade deal includes provisions for tariff reductions on a range of goods, the removal of certain trade barriers and the promotion of investments in industries and agriculture.\n\nEconomic experts predict this historic trade agreement could notably increase the bilateral trade volume between the two nations. Currently, trade between Israel and Egypt stands at approximately $300 million per year, which is anticipated to increase by as much as 50% within the first two years of implementing the agreement.\n\nReaction to the deal has been largely positive, with many Middle East commentators viewing this as a potentially transformative arrangement, signaling a profound shift in Egypt-Israel relations. However, some critics express concerns about the agreement's impact on domestic industries and its potential to stir political tensions.\n\nThe trade deal between the two nations arrives at a time when conflicts and tensions continue to persist in the Middle East. Nevertheless, it offers a hopeful glimpse into a future of increased regional integration, prosperity, and cross-border collaboration.\n\nThis marks a new chapter, not just in Egypt-Israeli relations, but potentially in the broader Middle East region. As the world watches closely, only time will tell how this agreement unfolds and the lasting implications it will have on the region's future stability and development. Regardless of the challenges ahead, this deal serves as a testament to the power of diplomacy and inter-state cooperation.",
    "Tottenham Hotspur are set to secure Iceland's Under-21 seminar, Ísak Bergmann Jóhannesson, as they continue to revitalize their team under new coach Antonio Conte. The management is keen to incorporate the young talent into their ranks and see him as a good investment for the future. \n\nFollowing an impressive run for IFK Norrköping in the Swedish top tier, where he scored six goals in 29 appearances this season, the 18-year-old has been heavily watched by multiple clubs. His recent outings have also given him prominence on the international stage, putting him firmly on Spurs' radar.\n\nDespite his young age, Jóhannesson has already garnered attention as one of the most promising talents the Icelandic youth system has produced. His versatility and technical skills set him apart from other players of his age group, making him a key target for Tottenham's recruitment plans.\n\nTottenham Hotspur's latest move aligns with Conte's strategic vision, focusing on a blend of established professionals and talented youngsters. Jóhannesson fits the mould contemplating his age and the pace of his development.\n\nThough his preferred position is in central midfield, Jóhannesson has showcased a flexibility that allows him to play on the wing or as an attacking midfielder, a trait that naturally appeals to Spurs. His skills on the ball, decision-making capacity, and ability to create chances for teammates are assets that could potentially boost the London side's offensive arsenal.\n\nOther clubs like Juventus and Manchester United had been linked to the young Icelandic star but it seems that Tottenham has moved quickest in the race for his signature.\n\nThe deal, rumoured to be in the region of £10million, would further Tottenham's investment in youth talent. In the past, the club has demonstrated a record of developing young talent, best exemplified by the emergence of Harry Kane and more recently Oliver Skipp.\n\nThe signing will also mark another increase in the number of Icelandic players in the Premier League, highlighting the growing reputation of the country's football prowess.\n\nAs the final paperwork is drawn up, it seems increasingly clear that the young Viking might be swapping the Norrköping skies for the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium come the transfer window. It remains to be seen how this promising player will fare in one of the world's most competitive leagues.",

    "Arsene Wenger, the renowned former coach of Arsenal FC, is set to return to the soccer world with a substantial summer budget to boot. \n\nIn what is certain to energize enthusiasts of the beautiful game, football insiders hint that Wenger has been given a formidable \"war chest\" for the summer. The exact amount remains shrouded in secrecy, although the figure is speculated to be sizable enough to make significant investments in fresh talent.\n\nDuring his 22-year tenure at Arsenal, Wenger was celebrated for his ability to identify and nurture young talents, turning them into world-class players. The return of such a colossal figure to active football with a significant budget to upgrade a team will undoubtedly set tongues wagging about potential transfer targets.\n\nWenger, a master tactician, has been on a self-imposed sabbatical from the game since stepping down from the helm at Arsenal in 2018. His return with a substantial financial backing has sparked wild speculation on his next move. \n\nAlthough the club Wenger will be working with continues to be a closely-guarded secret, insiders suggest it could be one in need of substantial rebuilding. With his uncanny ability to transform lesser-known players into footballing powerhouses, it will be interesting to see who Wenger brings into the fold. \n\nThe Frenchman’s approach to team building, alongside his massive war chest, could lead to a shift in power in world football. Wenger’s pedigree and apparent funds have instantly put top clubs on notice.\n\nWhen we consider Wenger's history, it's not unreasonable to expect thrilling transfers. Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil, and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang were all high-profile signings brought in under his watch at Arsenal.\n\nWhile the announcement brings about excitement, it also revives noted criticism of Wenger's polarizing tenure at Arsenal. Critics accused him of being overly frugal and failing to deliver Premier League titles consistently.\n\nNonetheless, Wenger's potential return to football management, equipped with a loaded war chest, is a thrilling prospect for any football fan. One can only wait in anticipation to see what surprises Wenger has in store for the summer transfer window.\n\nFew can argue that Wenger's return to the sport, coupled with a significant budget, will add much-needed spice to the forthcoming summer activities. Whether he sinks or swims in these turbulent football waters, it is safe to say that the Wenger effect is back.",
    "A high-ranking executive at Marsh & McLennan Companies, one of the world's leading professional services firms, has pleaded guilty to criminal charges following an investigation by law enforcement authorities.\n\nThe charges against the unnamed executive were not detailed in the court documents, but sources close to the case mentioned multiple accounts of fraudulent activity within the organization, adding that this plea could be the first of many.\n\nMarsh & McLennan, a global leader in insurance broking and risk management, has not yet released a formal statement about the executive's admission of guilt. However, the company has previously stated that it is fully cooperating with the authorities in their investigation and is committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance.\n\nThe guilty plea marks a significant development in the ongoing investigation into potential insider trading and serious irregularities at Marsh, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and employs over 65,000 people globally.\n\nThe authorities, including the New York State Attorney General's office and the Securities and Exchange Commission, declined to comment on the ongoing investigation. However, they did confirm that the Marsh executive's plea is part of a wider operation targeting white-collar crime.\n\nObservers say the guilty plea could have far-reaching implications, not only for Marsh & McLennan but also for the industry as a whole. If charges prove rampant within such a large and respected organization, many will begin questioning the practices within other brokerages.\n\nLegal experts suggested the guilty plea offers important leverage for prosecutors. \"When a high-ranking executive pleads guilty, it opens many doors for the investigation. They can provide inside information, corroborate evidence, and even testify against co-conspirators,\" revealed a New York attorney knowledgeable about white-collar crime investigations.\n\nAs Marsh & McLennan navigates this complex legal situation, shareholders and clients will undoubtedly be watching closely. While white-collar crime is unfortunately a well-known risk in the world of business, it is still shocking when it occurs at such high levels within an organization.\n\nThis case serves as a somber reminder that no company, irrespective of its size or reputation, is immune to potential legal and ethical breaches. The ramifications of this guilty plea will be studied intensively, potentially causing ripples of change across the business landscape.",
    "The Christmas spirit has been disturbed by an unwelcome visitor this year, an internet worm named 'Santy'. This malicious software has been wreaking havoc throughout websites worldwide during the festive season. \n\nThe Santy worm targets the PHP bulletin board system, a common format used by many websites for online discussions. Upon infestation, this worm changes websites to display the message: \"This site is defaced!!! This site is defaced!!! NeverEverNoSanity WebWorm generation.\"\n\nRecent reports have confirmed that approximately 40,000 websites were affected worldwide within 24 hours of the worm’s release. Varying from online businesses to personal blogs, these sites were left with the aforementioned disturbing message in place of their usual content. \n\nExperts reckon that the worm uses the Google search engine to find new sites to attack. Once the Santy worm infects a PHP bulletin board, it starts to create multiple threads. Each of them searches for more bulletin boards through Google. Due to the exponential increase in the number of threads, websites experience frequent crashes. \n\nGoogle has been notified of the worm's activities and has already taken steps to stop it from accessing the search engine. Said a representative, “We are aware of the situation and have steps in place to defend against this issue.” However, the sheer number of sites affected by the worm is showing just how challenging it is to stop its rampage entirely.\n\nThe authors of the PHP bulletin board system are set to release an upgrade to the system that will make it more resistant to the attacks by the worm. Website administrators across the spectrum are waiting eagerly for this update so they can restore their websites back to their original nature.\n\nIronically, this worm was named after the Santa Claus, the symbol of joy and happiness during the Christmas season. Instead of spreading cheer, the Santy worm has brought a clear disruption to the festive spirit.\n\nCybersecurity companies have been urging businesses and individuals to improve their online security measures. In these evolving digital times, it's essential more than ever, to take care of not just our physical security but also our digital one.\n\nThe Santy worm’s unwelcome visit once again underscores the risks inherent in our interconnected virtual world. It serves as a stark reminder that the web is not just a network of webs, but also a potential highway for digital malevolence. This Christmas, the urgent call clearly is to shield businesses and personal digital estates by taking cyber threats seriously.\n",
    "Rangers emerged victorious in the much-anticipated Old Firm derby, reinforcing a resolute grip on the Scottish Premiership. They underlined their title credentials by outclassing arch-rivals Celtic in a thrilling clash at Ibrox.\n\nIt was the Gers who dominated the game from the start, pressing high and pushing Celtic back with slick movements and intricate passages of play. They carved open the Celtic defence time and again with remarkable ease. \n\nManager Steven Gerrard had stressed the importance of this clash in the build up to the game and hailed his team's commitment and impressive performance, calling it an \"incredibly important\" victory.\n\nIn front of a fervent home crowd, Rangers took the lead midway through the first half when Joe Aribo's clever finish found the back of the net. This was soon followed by another brilliant goal from marauding full-back James Tavernier before the interval.\n\nCeltic came into the game more in the second half, but despite their best efforts, they struggled to break down a disciplined Rangers defence. The Blues remained calm and resolute, defending as a unit and denying space to the Celtic forwards.\n\nEven when Celtic managed to pull a goal back, courtesy of a David Turnbull strike, Rangers refused to panic. They instead pressed on for another goal, a move that killed off the game when Alfredo Morelos slotted one into the corner.\n\nWith full-time whistle, it was clear that Rangers had turned the tables on their arch-rivals and ignited a new chapter in the Old Firm history. This win, a first in three meetings for Gerrard's side, takes them seven points clear at the top of the Premiership.\n\nThe elation was evident amidst the Rangers camp. Gerrard said: \"We knew what was at stake today. The players showed up and delivered exactly what was asked of them\".\n\nCeltic’s manager, meanwhile, was left with plenty of soul-searching. They’ll need to come up with a new plan to regain their lost ground in the title race. As for Rangers, this victory isn't just three points, it's a statement of intent that they are here to challenge for the title. \n\nThe Old Firm derby always carries significant weight in Scottish Football and with this victory, Rangers have surely delivered a psychological blow to their rivals. But as always, there's still a long season ahead. The endurance, consistency and determination shown by both teams will determine who lifts the Scottish Premiership trophy.",
    "The leader of the Conservative Party, also known as the Tories, has unveiled a comprehensive spending plan for the United Kingdom. The new budget envisages significant increases in public sector spending, a shift in policy that marks a stark departure from the austerity measures of the recent past.\n\nTory leader, yet to comment on speculation around the timing of this announcement, made a clear attempt to balance fiscal prudence with ambitious public service investments. The bulk of the spending will focus on the health sector, education, also infrastructure development and the fight against climate change.\n\n\"Responsible spending is not about saying 'yes' to every demand for new funding, but about prioritising key areas. It's about investing in our future while ensuring the stability of our economy,\" the Tory leader said while detailing the proposed budget. He asserted that his aim is to lay the groundwork for post-pandemic recovery, focusing on both protection and progress.\n\nUnder the proposed spending plan, NHS funding is set to increase dramatically, with billions earmarked for improving services, increasing capacity, and addressing the mental health crisis deepened by the pandemic. Education is another significant beneficiary, with a substantial rise in per-pupil funding. In addition, the leader announced a multi-billion pound plan to revamp the UK's infrastructure, including rail, road, and digital networks.\n\nArguably, the most ambitious aspect of the Tory leader's plan is the significant investment to tackle climate change. The budget allocates funds for renewable energy, carbon capture technology, and environmental conservation measures, indicating a hopeful commitment to meet the UK's target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nCritics, however, argue that the proposal comes without a clear plan for how the substantial increase in public spending will be financed. They worry it could lead to further borrowing, thus increasing public debt.\n\nThe Labour Party responded with scepticism. \"While increased spending in vital public services is to be welcomed, we need a clear and coherent plan to pay for it,\" said the Labour Party spokesperson.\n\nMany believe the unveiling of the spending plan could be a sign of an imminent general election. But, whether or not this speculation holds, it seems the Tory leader is gearing up for a different kind of conservative party, one that borrows some traditionally labour ideas on public sector investment to create a new political middle ground.\n\nWith this bold spending plan, the Tories seem to be signalling a large-scale transformation in their approach to governance. Whether it will be embraced by conservatives across the board remains to be seen. As for the public, they will have to",
    "In a significant blow to England's rugby hopes, star player Billy Robinson has been ruled unfit for the upcoming Six Nations tournament due to an unexpected injury. \n\nRobinson, 28, known for his exceptional play in previous tournaments, sustained a knee injury during training this week. Medical exams revealed that the lock has a torn ligament which requires at least six weeks of recovery time, hence his non-participation in the tournament, confirmed England team's Physician Dr. Peter Arnold. \n\nEngland Coach Mike Gordon expressed his disappointments, saying, \"I am devastated for Billy. He has been a tremendous player for us, and his presence will be sadly missed. However, I am confident that our team has the strength and the talent to compete fearlessly.\"\n\nRobinson's injury could mean a reshuffling of the squad, which will present an opportunity for other players to step up. The injury has also triggered speculation about Robinson’s replacement for the championship. Young talents like Jake Ashton and Charlie Redwood could potentially fill Robinson's position.\n\nRobinson, widely regarded as one of England's finest rugby players, said in a statement, \"I'm devastated to be missing out on the Six Nations. I've done my utmost to be fit for the tournament, but it's just not meant to be. I'll be supporting the guys from the sidelines and can't wait to see them do us proud.\"\n\nWhile Robinson's absence will be a huge setback, the England team remains optimistic about their prospects. Many believe this challenge will test the depth and adaptability of the team. \n\nEngland will kick off their Six Nations campaign in a match against Scotland at Twickenham stadium next month. A victory in the opener will go a long way in instilling confidence and developing momentum without their leading player on the pitch.\n\nThe Six Nations Championship is an annual international rugby union competition between the teams of England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, France, and Italy. Slated to start next month, this highly competitive tournament has been keenly awaited by rugby fans worldwide.\n  \nThe England Rugby Team and its fans will certainly have to adjust their hopes as they head into the Six Nations without Robinson.

    "Analysts predict that the issue of immigration will play a pivotal role in the upcoming general elections as party leaders sharpen their stance. Amid the increasing public concerns over immigrant integration and border controls, the topic is poised to attract significant attention. \n\nNational surveys reveal that immigration is a key concern for many voters, second only to healthcare and economy. With growing concerns about national identity, security, jobs and social cohesion, it is likely that voices calling for a stricter and more controlled immigration policy will grow louder in the lead-up to the election. \n\nThe governing party looks set to highlight its achievements in reducing unauthorized crossings and strengthening border security. They are expected to further propose amendments aimed at enhancing control over immigration. Meanwhile, opposition parties are reportedly preparing to question these measures, suggesting that government policies have been driven more by populist concerns than by a genuine, well-considered strategy.\n\nActivist groups and non-governmental organizations, on the other hand, argue that turning immigration into a political weapon ignores the broader context of global crises that are driving people to migrate. They opine that restrictions on immigration can be detrimental to the country's multicultural fabric and overall economic growth.\n\nIn a volatile political climate, it remains to be seen how the debate will play out and what impact it will have on the ultimate electoral outcomes. As the campaign trail heats up, it is clear that the narrative around immigration will be a determining factor, making this a contentious issue not just nationally, but one that resonates globally.\n\nHowever, experts advise that while immigration is indeed a critical issue, it should not detract from other crucial concerns that require attention. They argue that a balanced debate encompassing an array of issues from healthcare to education, housing and the economy are equally important for a holistic approach towards policy formation.\n\nWith numerous perspectives attempting to define the nation's outlook on immigration, the upcoming election promises to be a platform of rigorous debate and discussion. As parties vie for public support, how they plan to address the nuances of the immigration issue will undoubtedly be a significant factor in the electoral decision-making process.",

    "The world of education is witnessing a shift as video games are increasingly being used as a tool to enhance learning in classrooms around the world. This innovative approach, known as game-based learning, embraces the power of digital games to create engaging, interactive, and immersive experiences for students.\n\nEducators argue that bringing games into the classroom can facilitate problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and foster collaboration among students. This notion is backed by several studies, suggesting that this novel approach of instruction could shape the future of education.\n\nAn illustrative example of this is Minecraft, a popular game that has a special educational edition used in over 100 countries. Players build and explore virtual worlds, picking up key skills in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) subjects along the way. Games like these compel students to engage creatively with the curriculum, making classwork more enjoyable and educational simultaneously.\n\nIn Finland, a country renowned for its innovative education system, has introduced a digital platform called \"Seppo\", which allows teachers to turn lessons into interactive games. Seppo’s CEO, Riku Alkio, says the system aims to make learning a collaborative and creative process. Teachers in over 50 countries are now using Seppo’s game-based learning platform to enhance their lessons.\n\nProf. Vanessa Brown of the Institute of Educational Technology at the Open University says, \"Games in the classroom offer a new perspective on teaching by placing students in an active, rather than a passive role in their learning journey. Moreover, including games can stimulate enthusiasm and interest in subjects students might otherwise disregard.\"\n\nHowever, integrating games into the curriculum is not without challenges. Concerns include the potential for games to distract rather than enlighten, the issue of equitable access to technology, and the need for professional development for teachers to effectively implement game-based learning.\n\nDespite these hurdles, game-based learning continues to gain traction. Tech giants such as Microsoft and Google are investing in educational gaming platforms, indicating the potential growth and impact of this strategy in the education sector.\n\nIt seems, as digital natives, today's students are poised to reap the educational benefits that classroom games can bring. Innovative teaching methods, when implemented correctly, have the potential to revolutionise traditional classroom pedagogy.",

    "Franz Ferdinand, the popular Scottish band known for their distinctly evocative sound, paid a memorable visit to their native Glasgow School of Art (GSA) today. The band, initially formed at the said art school back in 2002, returned to their roots for a unique lesson promoting creativity in music and the arts. \n\nAlex Kapranos, the frontman, along with fellow band members Robert Hardy, Paul Thomson, and Julian Corrie led a workshop with current GSA music students. Their aim? To share invaluable personal insights, industry advice, and even a sneak peek into their creative process. \n\nKapranos, also an alumnus of the institution, addressed the students with a sense of nostalgia, \"Our journey began in these very halls. The creative energy and artistic freedom that this school cultivates is the reason Franz Ferdinand exists today.\"\n\nThe band attributes a significant amount of their success to the innovative and creative environment offered by GSA. \"We were surrounded by like-minded individuals who believed in pushing boundaries, experimenting, and expressing themselves, which undoubtedly had a profound impact on our music,\" shared Hardy.\n\nThroughout the workshop, the band emphasized the importance of artistic freedom, individuality, and experimentation. They discussed their journey in the music industry — the initial struggles, the evolution of their sound, and the highs and lows of global stardom. \n\nIncluded in the lesson was a distinct emphasis on resilience. \"It is so easy to get disheartened in this industry,\" Thomson advised. \"There will be plenty of rejections and criticisms, but it is crucial to keep pushing through, refining your craft, and staying true to your sound.\"\n\nForming a more interactive segment of the workshop, students were given the opportunity to present their own original pieces, receiving constructive feedback from Franz Ferdinand members. \n\nChloe Stewart, a third-year music student, enthused, \"To have such an influential band personally critique our work and give us industry insights is surreal.

    "With the festive season fast approaching, the annual Gadget Show's attention has turned towards the rise of the MP3 player, signalling what could be the beginning of an MP3 revival season.\n\nThe interactive event, known for showcasing the latest and potentially most influential technological trends, was teeming with manufacturers presenting innovations in audio devices, particularly MP3 players. From sleek and slim designs that blend modern aesthetics with easy portability, to those with expanded memories to accommodate music lover's extensive playlists, the focus was clearly on the reinvention of the seemingly fading device.\n\nIn an era where having a smartphone seems enough to enjoy music, the humble MP3 player is making its comeback, unbowed by the stream of smart gadgets. According to tech experts at the show, the resurgence of MP3 players is driven by the consumer desire for a standalone device specifically for music. \n\nOne major highlight of the Gadget Show was Sony's new MP3 player. Despite the company's focus on modern tech gadgets like gaming consoles and smart television, Sony surprised attendees with a sleek, feature-laden MP3 device with advanced sound technologies. \n\nUnlike common perception that the decline in MP3's popularity was due to the rise of smartphones, speakers at the show contended that the truth is not so black and white. They pointed to the fatigue and dissatisfaction with poor battery life and mediocre sound quality offered by smartphones when used as primary music devices. \n\nThe show also shed light on the growing market for high-resolution audio, requiring a device with more processing power and memory space, factors which many smartphones struggle to provide. This has led to music lovers going back to dedicated music players, thus fostering the MP3 revival. \n\nMoreover, the Vinyl resurgence trend proves that there is still a demand for tangible and standalone music devices. The same nostalgic sentiment appears to extend to the MP3 players, offering a sense of ownership as opposed to the leasing model of music streaming services.\n\nWhile the exhibition buzzed with other new technological showcases such as VR headsets, drones, and smart home devices, it was the humble MP3 player that ironically stood out as the dark horse of the event. Thus, as Christmas looms on the horizon, and gift shopping commences, it appears this holiday season might just be a memorable one for the MP3, the little gadget that refuses to bow out of the game.",
    "Former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his successor Gordon Brown are facing new claims of a deepening rift, shaking the unity of the Labour Party further. These claims, made by well-placed insiders, have reignited concerns about the stability of the party leadership.\n\nSources within the party allege that the dispute rooted in the 2007 transition period, when Blair stepped down as Prime Minister and Brown assumed office, is resurfacing. It is said that the tensions revolve around differing views on how to resuscitate Labour’s flagging poll ratings and its overall direction.\n\nWhile Mr Blair has always championed a centre ground approach, reports suggest that Mr Brown, pointing to the electoral success of the Conservative Party, has been advocating a move towards position itself as a more traditional socialist party. These differing political strategies have reportedly caused tension, but agreement over how to handle the hot-button issue of Brexit has also been elusive.\n\nThe alleged disagreements have not been formally corroborated but the lack of a united front from the former leaders of the Party has sparked speculation amongst political commentators and it feeds into a wider narrative of a fragmented Party.\n\nAndy Burnham, current Mayor of Manchester and former Labour leadership contender, commented that the persistent rumours of conflict between Blair and Brown were detrimental to the party's image. He urged the pair to set aside their differences, stressing that unity was \"paramount\" especially amidst Conservative dominance. \n\nThe Labour Party has not officially commented on the rumours. Several Labour MPs have dismissed the claims as 'tittle-tattle', insistent that the focus should be on salvageable actions to reverse the downward trajectory in the polls.\n\nThe issue of party unity has been of particular concern in recent years for Labour, having seen a significant decline in their traditional voting base, and in particular among the working class.

    "Oil prices have rallied, bouncing back from their recent slump caused by extreme weather conditions, reinforcing the commodity's resilience in turbulent times. The rebound followed a period of disruption due to unseasonable conditions that affected output from several major oil-producing nations.\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, rose to $68.91 a barrel – a noticeable upswing compared to its low price amidst the weather-related disturbances. Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the US standard, surged to $65.36 per barrel, a significant recovery from its previous dip.\n\nIndustry insiders attribute this reassuring rebound in prices to multiple factors. A decrease in US inventories, coupled with an increase in demand as global economies reopen from coronavirus lockdowns, is playing a notable role in bolstering prices.\n\n\"The weather-related interruptions in Texas and other oil-producing states indeed battered the industry and resulted in temporary price fluctuations,\" said Daniel Yergin, an energy expert. \"However, the swift rebound reflects the robustness of the oil market despite such adversities.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with its allies, including Russia - a group known commonly as OPEC+, maintains a cautiously optimistic outlook. OPEC+ has implemented production cuts aiming to reduce the global supply glut and stabilise prices. The rebound also underscores the apparent effectiveness of these efforts, as the weather-related disturbances did not cause a long-lasting drop.\n\nBesides, a continuation of the current trend could see oil prices returning to pre-pandemic levels. However, the trajectory of the market largely depends on factors such as vaccine rollouts, ease of travel restrictions, and strengthening of global economies.\n\nNevertheless, the recent rebound has put oil-market traders and investors somewhat at ease. The swift recovery suggests that while the oil market isn't free from adverse weather spurred disruptions or other external factors, it remains comparatively resilient.\n\nThe market is awaiting a more solid stability that can only be achieved when the global vaccine rollout accelerates, leading to the revival of the sectors heavily reliant on oil such as aviation and tourism. With such sectors rebounding, the demand for oil is expected to reach its pre-pandemic level, reinforcing the trend in oil price recovery.\n  \nOn a larger scale, the revival of oil prices consolidates a central role for the commodity in the global economy, even as discussions on a transition to greener energy sources continue to make headlines. Despite the challenges, oil continues to demonstrate its paramount importance as a pillar supporting the global economic structure, with its recent rebound as a testament.",
    "Negotiations are underway between the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) as they attempt to find a resolution to a long-standing dispute over aircraft subsidies. The two global powers aim to end years of transatlantic tension and prevent a broader trade war that could severely impact the global economy.\n\nThe disagreement, which dates back to 2004, centres around government subsidies provided by the EU to aviation giant Airbus and by the US to aerospace manufacturer Boeing. Both sides claim these subsidies distort the global market, contributing to an unfair advantage for the two leading aircraft makers.\n\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) has ruled on numerous occasions that both Airbus and Boeing have received unfair subsidies. This has resulted in mutual accusations and retaliatory tariffs, making the conflict one of the longest-running and most complicated in the WTO history.\n\nThe ongoing talks mark a shift in the dynamics under President Joe Biden, offering hope for a more diplomatic resolution. The new US administration appears keen to find a mutually agreeable solution to the trade dispute, marking a significant change in approach from the more confrontational stance adopted under the previous administration.\n\n\"By coming back to the negotiating table, both parties are showing their commitment to finding a resolution that respects the rules of international commerce,\" said EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis. \"We are dedicated to finding a resolution to this long-standing dispute and ensuring fair competition.\"\n\nIn a similar vein, Katherine Tai, the US Trade Representative, commented, \"These negotiations underscore our commitment to resolving this dispute and finding a mutually beneficial path forward to ensure a level playing field.\"\n\nIf successful, an agreement could pave the way for broader diplomatic discussions, with both sides keen to address shared global challenges, such as dealing with China's rise. In addition, the aviation industry stands to benefit significant as an end to the tit-for-tat import tariffs would ease transatlantic tensions and, potentially, prices for airliners.\n\nHowever, reaching a deal will undoubtedly be challenging, considering the multi-faceted complexities and the long history of the dispute.\n\nDespite potential roadblocks, these negotiations represent a critical step towards harmonising trade relations between the EU and US. Both parties expressed optimism about coming to a consensus that could finally settle the 17-year-old dispute. The global aviation industry, still grappling with the impact of the pandemic, eagerly awaits a resolution that could relieve one of its longest-standing areas of contention.",

    "Rapid advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) technology have seen robots being integrated into society in increasingly unprecedented ways. Whether in hospitals, homes, or on the streets, robots have evidently begun to interact with humans and with other robots, necessitating the need for 'robotiquette’ - a set of rules that govern the ways in which machines interact with humans and each other. \n\nResearchers from some of the world’s leading universities have been focusing on teaching robots these 'robotiquette' rules, to ensure they behave in a socially acceptable and practical manner. This involves teaching robots how to assess their environment and the behaviour and cues of those around them.\n\nDr. Susan Jones, a robotics expert from Stanford University, said, \"Given that human beings have social rules, it's essential that we teach robots 'robotiquette' for them to understand and anticipate human reactions. It also promotes effective interactions between robots.\"\n\nSeveral reports illustrate how robots in logistic warehouses can now prioritize tasks, coordinate their activities, and give way to each other on busy routes to avoid collisions. In healthcare, robots are learning how to interpret human expression to respond differently in situations, prioritizing compassion over efficiency.\n\nThese rules take the form of intelligent algorithms integrated into their operating code, enabling robots to make decisions that consider their surroundings and situations. However, this doesn't just involve application of set rules but allowing robots to learn and adapt to new situations and environments. \n\nResearchers at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a methodology that allows robots to learn from past experiences and adjust their behaviour. A similar project at Carnegie Mellon University uses machine learning methods for robots to adapt their etiquette rules according to novel encounters.\n\nWhile the idea of 'robotiquette' is gaining traction, there are concerns over the difficulty of standardising these rules due to cultural differences. A gesture or phrase that might be considered quite normal in one culture may be seen as inappropriate in another. \n\nHowever, pioneers of 'robotiquette' believe that robots can adapt to these cultural variations. Dr. Jones adds, \"Assuming that we can develop culturally sensitive AI, robots could adjust their behaviour according to the culture and the individual they are interacting.\"\n\nThis exciting development in the field of robotics and AI is seen as vital for the successful integration of these machines into human societies. As AI continues to shape our world in unprecedented ways, it’s becoming clear that 'robotiquette' will not just be a quirky notion, but an essential aspect of our mutual coexistence.",
    "Many Americans are expressing 'awards fatigue,' frustrated and overwhelmed with the seemingly continuous awards season circles pervading the entertainment industry, according to recent polls and social media trends. \n\nEach year, between the Grammys, the Oscars, the Golden Globes, and numerous other awards ceremonies, the United States experiences what is commonly referred to as 'awards season.' This series of shows, intended to honor the best in film, music, television, and other forms of entertainment, often dominates headlines and social media feeds. \n\nHowever, recent surveys and sentiment analysis conducted across various social media platforms indicate a growing disenchantment among Americans towards these events. The data collected suggests that an increasing number of individuals are feeling 'awards fatigue,' a term coined to describe the weariness and indifference people feel due to the overwhelming saturation of awards content. \n\nSeveral reasons might be contributing to this disenchantment. Notably, the accusations of lack of diversity and representation among awards nominees in recent years have marred the credibility of these awards. Furthermore, the pandemic has compelled most of these ceremonies to go virtual, resulting in a decline in showmanship, glitz, and glamour typically associated with these events.\n\nCritics have also pointed out that the significant number of award shows has led to an inevitable dilution of the recognition. Instead of a select few being celebrated for their exceptional work, it feels as though every week presents a new array of winners. This continuous celebration has left some viewers jaded, feeling as though the true value of these awards has diminished. \n\nIt’s not just viewers expressing this fatigue. Some in the industry have voiced their weariness too. In a recent interview, renowned film director Martin Scorsese lamented the 'awards politics' that he feels detract from the real art of filmmaking.\n\nDespite America's apparent 'awards fatigue,' the business of awards ceremonies continues to boom, spurred by advertising revenue and global interest. Yet, with viewer numbers dwindling year on year, the industry may need to rethink its strategy to keep audiences engaged and maintain credibility.\n\nMany Americans, it seems, are calling for a return to quality over quantity. The shift in audience sentiment might trigger a much-needed change in the awards industry: a condensed, more meaningful celebration that truly honors the best in the business rather than an endless cycle of red-carpet events. But only time will tell whether the industry will respond to this growing wave of 'awards fatigue.'",
    "Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has implored the European Union (EU) to end what he terms as the \"denial\" surrounding George W. Bush's presidency. He believes that disregarding the impact of the Bush era on international relations is counter-productive and that lessons should be learned from it instead.\n\nMr Blair, who was prime minister when Mr Bush was president, was speaking at a forum in Brussels. On the subject of the Bush administration, he urged the EU to understand the decisions that were made at the time and interpret them in the wider geopolitical context, rather than dismissing them outright.\n\n\"Whether you agreed with his policies or not, George W. Bush reshaped global policies in ways that still influence the international political landscape,\" Blair said.\n\nBlair highlighted the necessity to appreciate the historic events that transpired during the Bush administration, such as the Iraq war and harsh anti-terrorism measures. He comments that the EU is presently inclined to view those actions with rebuke, but in practice, they significantly influenced the policies of nations worldwide, including those of the EU.\n\nThe former premier underlined that while he understands the criticisms directed towards the Bush administration, there is a need for recognizing its contribution to shaping contemporary history. He acknowledges that reflecting on the intensely controversial era is challenging, but insisted that understanding and acknowledging it is critical.\n\nMr Blair's comments have stirred discussion among the EU, generating mixed responses. With some agreeing with his perspective that understanding the past is crucial for shaping the future, others continue to express their disapproval of Bush-era policies.\n\nMr Blair ended his address by urging the EU not just to critique the healthcare, economic, and foreign policies of the Bush administration, but also to analyze their lasting impact. The challenge, according to Blair, lies in recognizing where the EU's policies were impacted and consciously deciding how to move forward in light of this reality. \n\nThe ex-British Prime Minister maintained that learning from the past, no matter how difficult, is the key to crafting better strategies for the future, especially in today's deeply interconnected world.",
    "After a brief slump, home loan approvals in the UK are on a steady upward curve once again, latest reports suggest. This resurgence in the number of mortgage approvals is indicative of a recovering housing market, and suggests increased confidence among home buyers and lenders alike.\n\nData released by the Bank of England reveals that the number of mortgage approvals for home purchase rose to 86,921 in June, the highest it has been since February. This follows a decline during the months of April and May when the country was in the midst of the third COVID-19 lockdown. The figures marked a significant rebound from the near-historic low of around 9,300 in May 2020 amid the first pandemic lockdown.\n\nExperts attribute the rise in approvals to several contributing factors. Firstly, the impending end of the stamp duty holiday, which is set to conclude by the end of September, has led to a buying rush among prospective homeowners. Secondly, the return of 95% mortgages, supported by a government guarantee scheme launched in April, has enabled more first-time buyers to get onto the property ladder.\n\nIndustry analysts also highlight the role of changing work patterns post-lockdown. The migration from city areas to more suburban and rural regions has stimulated demand for housing purchases in those areas, particularly among those adopting hybrid or remote working models.\n\nWhile this resurgence is seen as a positive sign, some concerns persist. Mortgage approval levels, whilst high, still remain below the peak of over 100,000 seen in March 2020. In addition, the end of the stamp duty holiday could potentially lead to a cooling off in demand.\n\nThe question remains on how sustainable this resurgence will be, particularly as various government support measures in place to mitigate the impact of the pandemic are gradually being phased out. Experts called for continued support for the housing market to ensure stability.\n\nWith rising employment levels and a return to a degree of normality after the pandemic, many hope this increase in mortgage approvals is a sign of sustained market recovery. However, the industry will be keeping a close eye on developments, and on the impact of the end of the stamp duty holiday and furlough scheme, in the coming months.",
    "Multinational agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation, Monsanto, has been slapped with a punitive $1.5 million fine on charges of bribery. The alleged misconduct came to light after a comprehensive investigation was carried out by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, said the Department of Justice.\n\nThe fine results from an appalling incident in which Monsanto's Indonesian affiliates bribed a high-ranking Indonesian official. The bribes were allegedly paid to evade environmental impact assessment, which is absolutely compulsory for certain projects. The company sought for a decree that would bypass the need for an environmental study for its genetically modified cotton.\n\n\"We will not tolerate bribery in any form at any level,\" said a spokesperson from the Department of Justice. \"Any company seeing to advance their business interests through illegal payments will be brought to justice,\" they added.\n\nThe St. Louis-based corporation has subsequently agreed to work with the Department of Justice to settle all claims without admitting guilt, and pay the hefty fine. The management also consented to three years of close monitoring of their practices to ensure compliance with the law.\n\nThis marks a significant setback for Monsanto, which is already under fire from an array of critics. Environmentalists and human rights activists have frequently accused the firm of irresponsibly and recklessly pushing its genetically modified organisms into the environment and onto dinner tables all across the world.\n\nThe company's infamous genetically modified products, from corn to cotton, have already been banned in several countries due to health and environmental concerns. The recent bribery scandal adds another layer of controversy to Monsanto's already tarnished reputation, and further raises concerns about the ethical practices employed by large multinational companies.\n\nWhile the $1.5 million fine might not undermine the financial stature of Monsanto, which makes billions each year, it does serve as a public black mark against the corporation and a reminder to all firms of the consequences of improper conduct. The hefty price tag acts more as a deterrent against such unethical actions in future by corporations of this scale.\n\nThere has been no official statement from Monsanto on the judgement as of yet.\n",

    "In the dynamic era of the digital revolution, a new class of criminals is emerging, particularly in the arena of high technology, where the payoffs can be immensely profitable.\n\nWith increased reliance on online banking, virtual transactions, and digital currencies, as well as a surge in valuable assets found on the cloud, tech-savvy criminals have been provided with all the tools necessary to prosper. This technological advancement has dredged up a surge in cybercrime targeted at high-net-worth individuals and corporations, rendering the concept of traditional theft obsolete.\n\nHigh-profile break-ins have become far more frequent in recent years with global police forces reporting an escalating trend. The targets are not cash or physical goods, rather sensitive information, intellectual property, and digital assets stored in seemingly secure cloud-based systems.\n\nA report from cybersecurity firm CipherTrace estimated that digital thieves stole more than $1.7 billion in cryptocurrencies alone in 2018, a number expected to rise as digital assets increase in value. \n\nAnother attack vector is through ransomware, where hackers lock users out of their own system and demand a ransom in exchange for access. Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that by this year, businesses worldwide could fall victim to a ransomware attack every 11 seconds. \n\nGlobal corporations like Twitter, Adobe, and LinkedIn have all fallen prey to data breaches, exposing the data of millions of users. However, it is not just tech giants who are at risk. Last year, nearly 50% of cyber-attacks targeted small businesses, indicating that no one is off limits.\n\n\"Rather than burglars physically breaking down front doors or safecrackers taking their chances, criminals are now hiding behind screens, comfortably stealing millions at the click of a button,\" explains Matt Walmsley, EMEA Director at Vectra AI.\n\nIn response to these new threats, an industry of digital security services is developing at an unprecedented rate. Cybersecurity is no longer a luxury for organizations but a necessary requirement to combat this rapidly growing threat.\n\nCybersecurity experts are calling for companies and individuals alike to employ robust digital hygiene practices, such as strong password protection, data encryption, regular software updates, and multi-factor authentication. \n\nHowever, as the technology evolves, so too does the sophistication of hackers. Therefore, law enforcement agencies and businesses worldwide must keep improving their strategies to stay one step ahead in this digital cat and mouse game.\n\nIn conclusion, the digitization of our lives, even though it facilitates simplicity and convenience, has also unlocked new opportunities for high-tech thieves.

    "The stock market in Jakarta tumbled as the nation started counting the cost of the devastating tsunami that struck Indonesia last week. The devastating tsunami has not only caused a tragic loss of life, but has also resulted at a steep monetary expense, which has distressed the Indonesian capital's stock exchange.\n\nThe Jakarta Composite Index (JCI), the country’s main stock index, had plummeted 2.2% by midday. Analysts say the tsunami’s devastation and the displacement of people will likely disrupt economic activities in the affected regions, offering a potential setback to the Indonesian economy which was just starting to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAnalysts have also speculated that the cost to rebuild and recover from the tsunami could reach billions of dollars, given the magnitude of destruction in the affected areas. This burden is set to strain the country's budget, which might result in a cut in state expenditure in other areas or increased borrowing, thus unsettling investors.  \n\nShares in construction and infrastructure companies initially rose on speculation that they would benefit from the rebuilding works, but later fell amid broader market losses. Domestic consumption, which accounts for more than half of Indonesia's GDP, is also expected to slow as the nation grapples with the aftermath of the disaster, which may lead to a further dip in the stock market.\n\n\"The human and physical toll of the tsunami is heartbreaking and shocking,\" said Rizal Ramli, a senior economist at Fitch Ratings in Jakarta. \"In addition to that, there's likely to be a significant economic toll as well. This could impact Indonesia's fiscal deficit.\"\n\nThe volatility in the Indonesian stock market comes amid concerns that the country's economic recovery from the pandemic could take longer than expected. Many believe the unexpected natural disasters coupled with the ongoing global pandemic could potentially delay the efforts of strengthening the country's economy. \n\n\"Strengthening our fiscal resilience in the face of natural disasters is vital,\" said Finance Minister Mulyani Indrawati. \"This requires us to think creatively and innovatively, given that these events can be unpredictable and bring about significant economic loss.\"\n\nThe Indonesian government has promised swift response and allocated funds for immediate relief activities. However, the longer-term economic impact of the disaster is less certain, displaying the need for economic contingency plans in the face of adversity.\n\nWhile efforts are being concentrated on rescuing survivors and rebuilding destroyed habitats, it is clear that Indonesia's recovery, both from the standpoint of human lives and economically, will be a massive undertaking. The tsunami's cost has indeed grossly affected Jakarta",
    "Efforts to prevent a looming strike by pension workers are underway as negotiations continue to address disagreements over potential reforms. This industrial action, which has the potential to significantly disrupt operations in various sectors, is expected to draw in thousands of employees who are demanding better terms for their retirement benefits. \n\nThe dispute arises from changes proposed by employers, which the workers' unions argue would undermine their members' future financial security. It has been reported that the proposed reforms aim to move the current definite benefit scheme to the less favourable defined contribution scheme.\n\nIn an effort to dissuade the unions from going ahead with the strike, high-level talks are taking place between government officials, union leaders and employers. The discussions are expected to focus on finding a compromise that will satisfy both parties, maintaining the financial stability of the pension funds whilst ensuring the future livelihoods of the workers.\n\nThe government has been urged to intervene, in hopes that a potential strike might be avoided. Such a strike could not only disrupt the operations of various sectors but could also affect the broader economy. Economists have warned that the strike might exacerbate the country's current economic struggles, leading to a slowdown in certain sectors.\n\nUnion leaders have indicated that the proposed pension reforms have struck a nerve with members, noting a high-level of engagement and willingness to strike if necessary. Many of those planning to strike argue that the proposed changes would lead to uncertainty and risk that they are not prepared to accept.\n\nThe potential strike highlights the growing concern among workers about their retirement security. Increasingly, employees across various industries are voicing concerns about the future of their pensions as debates about reform continue to escalate.\n\nThe success of these talks will determine whether the planned strike action will proceed or if a compromise can be found to appease both parties. However, preparation for strike action continues while the talks are ongoing. If the talks fail to reach a consensus, the public can expect service disruptions in various sectors, dependent upon the pension members involved.\n\nBoth parties have expressed their hope for a resolution within the given timeframe, emphasising the mutual desire to avoid industrial action if possible. Yet, as the negotiations proceed, it remains unclear whether an agreement can be reached, reinforcing the uncertainty that many pension funds and their recipients are currently facing. Nevertheless, the continuing talks suggest that efforts are being made to avoid the strike and reach a compromise. The conclusion of the negotiations is eagerly awaited by all parties involved.",
    "Despite advancements in technology, mobile multimedia still struggles to gain significant traction among consumers, according to recent studies. While smartphones and mobile internet usage continue to grow, the consumption of rich multimedia content has remained stagnant.\n\nAlthough mobile devices now have high-resolution screens capable of displaying crystal-clear videos and images, and improvement in network speeds have made streaming a near-seamless experience, consumers appear to be hesitant in fully embracing this technology. Many are yet to move beyond basic functionalities such as sending texts and making calls.\n\nAccording to a report by analytics company Newzoo, consumers spend only around 10% of their mobile internet use watching videos or engaging with other types of multimedia content. This number starkly contrasts with other types of mobile usage such as browsing social media communities and engaging in online gaming, which take up a combined 50% of total mobile internet use.\n\nExperts attribute this slower uptake of mobile multimedia to a range of factors, warning that without addressing these issues, multimedia providers might struggle to fully claim the mobile market. \n\nOne of the primary barriers to mobile multimedia adoption is the cost of data. High-quality video and audio streaming can consume a significant amount of data, leading users to ration their consumption to avoid incurring high costs or exceeding their data allowance. \n\nAnother factor is usability. Navigating multimedia content on mobile devices might be inconvenient for some users due to the smaller screens and lack of a mouse or a similar precision tool as in desktop devices.\n\nInfrastructure may perhaps be another potential cause. Despite the advent of faster network speeds, many regions still experience patchy or slow internet connections, leading to frustrating loading times. \n\nLastly, some experts opine that the lack of innovative mobile multimedia content is also a factor to consider. The conventional broadcasting style which dictates most multimedia content currently available is often off-putting for consumers accustomed to the interactive and personalised style of digital media content.\n\nAs technology and connectivity continue to evolve, it is likely that mobile multimedia will ultimately gain ground. But as it stands, media companies may have to focus more on innovation in content delivery and user interface design, while pushing for more affordable and equitable data policies.\n\nThis scenario serves as a wake-up call for tech firms, who may need to refocus their efforts on addressing the mobile multimedia adoption issues. Rather than simply increasing the technological capability of devices and networks, a holistic approach that fosters a comprehensive mobile multimedia experience is necessary to pave the way to the future.",
    "Wales received an uplifting piece of news ahead of their forthcoming international engagements as their star player, Williams, returned to full fitness, promising to bolster the squad's performance.\n\nWilliams, who has been on the sidelines due to an injury, has now fully recovered and is expected to take part in the upcoming fixtures.

    "Former US President George Bush has announced a fresh approach intended to tackle the increasing deficit that continues to burden the US economy. The strategy includes measures aimed at bringing budgetary discipline while stimulating economic growth. These statements were made during his recent speech at the economic summit in New York, providing insights into the course of action the Bush administration is set to take.\n\nBush's statements have come at a crucial time as the US is grappling with a rising deficit. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the federal budget deficit is projected to hit a record $3 trillion in the fiscal year of 2020, which is more than triple of that in 2019 and the highest as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since World War II.\n\nPresident Bush addressed this issue stating, \"The rising fiscal deficit is something our administration takes very seriously. It is paramount that we bring forward a set of tough, strategic, and concrete steps that can guide us towards an efficient and effective solution.\"\n\nProposed measures include a combination of spending cuts and tax reforms. They aim to fundamentally transform entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid that have been the key drivers of the long-term debt. While fleshing out details, Bush emphasized the necessity to forge bipartisan support to ensure the strategy's successful execution.\n\n\"Addressing the deficit issue is not a matter of partisan politics, but a shared responsibility amongst all Americans,\" said Bush. \"The journey to fiscal responsibility will be tough, but I am confident that we can navigate through these challenging times.\"\n\nMoreover, Bush's tough strategy also involves tax reforms to stimulate economic growth. \"We believe the engine of America's prosperity is a thriving private sector,\" he noted. He argued firmly for lowered business tax rates and simplifying the tax code to promote investment and innovation.\n\nThe announcement was met with mixed criticism and praise. While many conservatives lauded the president for taking a bold stance, liberals voiced their concerns about potential social inequality that these measures could create.\n\nAlthough the details of this strategy are still under wraps, it's clear that President Bush is prepared to get 'tough' on this significant issue. It remains to be seen how these directives will influence the country's ever-vital question of economic recovery and sustainability in the times to come.",
    "Tech giant Apple has initiated legal action to stem the flow of confidential company information, specifically relating to their new products. This move represents an intensified effort by the company to put an end to anticipatory press buzz that tends to surround their product line updates and launches.\n\nAccording to reports, the Silicon Valley based company has taken legal proceedings against several individuals who've been allegedly leaking Apple's proprietary and confidential information. The identities of these individuals haven’t been disclosed, but they are assumed to be Apple employees or contractors who have signed nondisclosure agreements.\n\nApple's decision to pursue legal action demonstrates a significant shift in its handling of leaks. Previously, the company had been dealing with such matters internally. However, recent high-profile leaks of their products prior to launch have seemingly pushed the tech giant to take stronger action.\n\nThis change in strategy may be due in part to the nature and size of recent leaks. Prior to the formal announcement of the iPhone 12, for instance, several websites and online forums were awash with detailed information about the device, including its specification, design, and release date.\n\nApple's specific claims in these lawsuits are unclear at present, but it is expected they will assert infringement of trade secrets, confidentiality obligations and, potentially, express breaches of employment or contractor agreements.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson made a statement remarking, \"Leaks harm our users and our business. They increase the chances of counterfeit products, lower the trust in our brand, and give competitors an unfair advantage.\" \n\nThe spokesperson emphasised that Apple prides itself on making cool products that surprise and delight customers. These leaks, however, rob customers of the excitement of getting to know the new product at the time of the official announcement.\n\nThe company has previously dispatched letters to employees reminding them of the company's firm policy against leaks. These letters also highlighted that such transgressions not only lead to job termination but, as seen from recent events, could potentially lead to legal consequences.\n\nThe outcome of these legal proceedings is yet to be known. But if successful, it could set a precedent for other tech companies also struggling with leaks of proprietary information, leading to a more comprehensive crackdown on such activities in the technology world. \n\nThere has been no public statement or comment on this matter from the accused yet, and the dates for the court proceedings are yet to be decided.",
    "The Nasdaq Stock Exchange is reportedly planning to raise capital through the sale of $100m worth of shares, according to financial industry sources. This move comes as the US-based exchange seeks to fund strategic initiatives and potential acquisitions. \n\nWhilst no comments have been made by official Nasdaq spokespeople, financial insiders have potentially linked these plans to the Exchange's need for extra capital following a series of international expansion moves and partnerships throughout the past year. \n\nNasdaq has been making significant advancements into global markets, seeking to strengthen their position against key competitors such as the New York Stock Exchange. The proposed share sale could potentially provide the financial bandwidth to further enable this process.\n\nHowever, some analysts have raised concerns of share dilution. This sale, they warn, could potentially devalue current stocks, potentially limiting the ability of current shareholders to achieve significant gains. Despite this potential drawback, other market experts have pointed to the strength of Nasdaq's balance sheet and continued growth, indicating that this could be a strategic move to take advantage of the current bull market.\n\nNasdaq’s last share offering was in 2006, when it sought to purchase a large stake in the London Stock Exchange. While the bid was unsuccessful, the money raised allowed for substantial development and expansion within the firm.\n\nThe Exchange has not released any official timeline for this potential share sale; however, if plans proceed, it will likely come within the next several months.\n\nThis sales initiative would be subject to regulatory approval in the United States. Given Nasdaq's stature and economic importance, the sale would likely be heavily scrutinised by official regulators. \n\nNasdaq, while being the second-largest exchange operator by market capitalisation in the world, complements its exchange operations with a strong technology segment that sells systems to other exchanges. This share sale might also be a move designed to raise capital for further investments in this area.\n\nInvestors, shareholders, and analysts around the global market will be keeping a close eye on further developments regarding this potential sale. We will continue to monitor this story and provide updates as more information becomes available.",

    "Sherlock Holmes has always been a crowd favourite, but it was actor Jeremy Brett who gave the iconic detective the most memorable television moment of 2004.\n\nJeremy Brett’s depiction of Sherlock Holmes is far from forgotten, as the British public voted his portrayal of the famous detective in the episode \"The Adventure of the Crooked Man\" as the top TV moment of 2004. This comes from a poll conducted by a leading UK television magazine, where Brett's display of uncanny deduction skills and intense charisma gave life to Conan Doyle's fiction like never before.\n\nThe moment from \"The Adventure of the Crooked Man\" that struck a chord with viewers involves Holmes revealing the mystery behind the murder of Colonel Barclay, which heeerily solves with the help of a pet mongoose. Brett's indelible performance shines with his unique blend of quirkiness and intensity, making it the unmatched choice of viewers as the top TV moment of the year. \n\nBrett's Holmes beat a slew of popular moments from other TV hits, like the gripping climax of political thriller \"State of Play\" and the tearjerking farewell of Rachel Green in the series finale of \"Friends\". \n\nBrett, who passed away in 1995, portrayed the Victorian-Era detective from 1984 to 1994, appearing in 41 episodes. The actor’s distinctive representation of the character gave a new depth and dimension to Holmes, making him more relatable and human. His versatile acting skills kept the audience hooked to the TV series, faithfully adapting Doyle's stories.\n\nThe result of this poll is a testament to Brett's timeless performance and The Granada series' enduring impression on the viewers. This TV moment symbolizes the perfect blending of a compelling script complemented by an equally exceptional performance.\n\nUpon news of the poll result, David Burke, who played Dr Watson alongside Brett, said, \"Jeremy would have been so pleased. He was very proud of the series, and he would have been deeply moved by the acknowledgment of the audience even all these years later.\"\n\nThis recognition serves as a tribute to Brett's compelling performance and the effortless embodiment of Sherlock Holmes, etching an indelible mark on TV history through the sheer brilliance of one unforgettable moment.\n",
    "In an ambitious move to combat poverty, the Indian government has rolled out a comprehensive budget aimed at disrupting the persistent cycle of deprivation among its distressed citizens. The anti-poverty budget, set to address critical issues of income inequality across the country, symbolises a renewed focus towards Social-Security led growth.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her annual budget speech in the parliament unveiled a raft of pro-poor policies that will pour billions of rupees into the rural economy, health sector, and other critical social services. Among the eye-catching measures being proposed are substantial hikes in spending on public health and education, significant boosting welfare payments, and increased financing to housing and urban development programs.\n\nBoosting rural incomes is among the critical concerns addressed through this budget. Creating more employment opportunities in rural areas is seen as a strategic move to facilitate reverse migration of workers who moved to cities and suffered during the Covid-19 lockdown periods. The rural jobs program is set to receive more than $8 billion, a nearly fifty percent increase compared with the previous budget.\n\nThe budget also includes heavy investments in universal healthcare, setting aside nearly $30 billion for health-and-wellness centres across the nation by the end of the current financial year. This initiative places special emphasis on strengthening health care in rural areas where medical facilities remain largely inaccessible for most of the population.\n\nAnother crucial announcement is the expansion of the nation's affordable housing scheme, with an emphasis on urban areas where the housing crisis is more pronounced. The Finance Minister pledged to deliver affordable housing for all urban poor by 2022. \n\nEducation, claiming a significant slice of the budget, plans to improve and expand access to quality education for underprivileged children across the country. The government has set aside an unprecedented sum to this sector, promising an innovative approach to ensure children in remote areas benefit from the digital revolution.\n\nReaction to the budget has been mixed. While many praise the bold step towards poverty alleviation, critics argue about the risks of the budget deficit. However, the government stands firm on the priorities set forth in the budget, expressing confidence in long-term economic growth brought about by investment in human and social capital.\n\nIt is clear that the government has prioritised alleviating poverty and reducing inequality over short-term economic yardsticks with this budget. The measure will certainly go some way in helping stressed and disadvantaged segments of Indian society while reflecting India's commitment to achieving Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations.\n\nThe success of these measures, however, will critically depend on how effectively they are implemented and the resilience of the Indian",
    "Former world number one, Justine Henin-Hardenne, is set to make a highly anticipated return to professional tennis at the Sydney International tournament. The Belgian star had been side-lined due to a viral infection that affected her performance and physical health.\n\nHenin-Hardenne, who has won seven Grand Slam titles, was forced to withdraw midway into the 2006 season after being diagnosed with the energy-sapping virus, known as cytomegalovirus.

Regardless of the outcome, her journey of resilience serves as a profound lesson to many aspiring athletes worldwide.",
    "Renowned computer engineer and designer, Jerry Manock, acknowledged as the creator of Apple's initial Macintosh computer, has passed away. He was instrumental in shaping the future of personal computing with his revolutionary contributions.\n\nMr. Manock, who was 82, had been a key figure in the technological landscape, helping to orchestrate the design of the first Apple Macintosh computer, which was released in 1984. The Macintosh was the first mass-market personal computer to feature a graphical user interface and a mouse, elements now familiar to every computer user.\n\nBorn in Wilmington, Delaware in 1939, Manock graduated from the University of Vermont with a mechanical engineering degree. He later earned a Master’s degree in Product Design at Stanford University. He was recruited by Steve Jobs in 1979 to develop an external case for Apple II, where he worked as an industrial designer and Mechanical Engineering Manager.\n\nManock is often admired for encapsulating Steve Jobs' vision of a 'computer for the rest of us'. His extraordinary design of the Macintosh was streamlined, approachable, and distinct, separating it from other machines available in the market during the era. It set the stage for Apple's enduring commitment to marry technology with aesthetics.\n\nBesides his work with Apple, Manock also co-founded the design consultancy firm, Manock Comprehensive Design, involved in many major projects concerning computer and industrial design. After leaving Apple in 1984, he resumed as a lecturer at the University of Vermont in the Department of Mechanical Engineering until his retirement in 2010.\n\n\"Jerry Manock significantly influenced the shape of personal computing. His vision and design principles gave life to technologies that have transformed human interaction with machines. His legacy lives on in the homes, offices and schools where Apple products are used,\" said technology analyst, Michael Gartenberg.\n\n“Jerry was not only incredibly talented but was a humble and gracious colleague. He will be greatly missed,” said Susan Kare, another of Apple's early pioneers.\n\nManock's death comes as a significant loss to the technology world. His work continues to inspire modern Apple design teams, and his many contributions to the industry are a testament to his lasting legacy. His innovative design and dedication to simplicity and functionality transformed the field of personal computing, enabling tech giants like Apple to redefine user experience and influence the way we interact with technology today.",
    "Sprinter, Jemma Holmes, has been hit by a devastating hamstring injury, a setback that could potentially disrupt her preparations for the forthcoming World Athletics Championships. \n\nHolmes, who holds the current national record in the 100m and 200m respectively, sustained the injury during a training session in Birmingham and is now waiting to ascertain the extent of the injury.\n\nWhile she was pushing her limits during a routine sprint training, an abrupt pain in her right hamstring led her to halt. The 26-year-old was promptly treated on the spot and sent for further medical evaluation. The event undoubtedly cast a cloud over what had been a highly promising build-up to the championships.\n\nThe world silver medalist's coach, James Johnson, expressed his concerns during a press conference. \"We are hopeful that it's not too severe but at this point we need to wait for the medical assessment,\" he said. \"Losing Jemma would undoubtedly be a blow to the team, but we have a strong contingent ready to step up.\"\n\nThis injury comes at a time where Holmes was in peak form, having recently posted personal bests in the Diamond League. She also won gold at the European Championships last year, strengthening her reputation as one of the world's leading sprinters.\n\nThe British Athletics is yet to release a formal statement regarding Holmes' condition, but an announcement is expected shortly. \n\nHolmes has expressed her disappointment about the injury yet she remains hopeful about a quick recovery. In a post on her social media account, she wrote, \"These challenges are part of the game, they test us, make us stronger. I’m going to do everything in my power to get back on the track soon. Thank you all for your messages of support\".\n\nMeanwhile, the World Championships, which are due to start in less than a month, are still scheduled to go ahead as planned. However, the potential absence of Holmes could seriously dent Britain's chances of securing a medal in the short sprints.\n\nWhether Jemma Holmes will run at the World Athletics Championships will likely come down to the results of the medical assessment, her rate of recovery, and the risk presented to further injury upon participation.",

    "Yesterday, my 6-month-old pup and I went out for a walk in the woods. She loves exploring new terrains and sniffing out all the different scents of nature. As we were walking, she came across a stream and, before I could stop her, she was already lapping up the water.\n\nI'm a fairly new dog owner and I've heard mixed things about dogs drinking from natural water sources. Some people say it's completely safe while others warn about the possible bacteria and parasites that can be present in the water. She seems to be perfectly fine so far, no signs of discomfort or illness, but I can't help but worry.\n\nAre there any specific signs or symptoms I should be on the lookout for? If any other dog owners have experience with this, your advice would be greatly appreciated. Would it be helpful to take her to the vet preemptively or should I just keep a watchful eye for any abnormal behavior/change in her routine?\n\nAgain, she's a pretty energetic pup and has a good appetite but I want to be cautious.

    "I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but I'm desperate for advice or even just some words of encouragement right now. I feel like my world is crashing down and I'm so terrified. \n\nI was at a party with a close friend and we were drinking. Nothing unusual, unfortunately, we couldn't find a designated driver so we decided to sleep over. I drank a bit more than I should have and that's the last thing I remember. \n\nA couple of days later someone from my college shared a video in our class group chat. It was me, unconscious, clearly drunk, being... violated. The thought that someone not only violated me, but recorded it and has been sharing it, honestly makes me feel sick. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I don't know how to deal with this. \n\nI've talked to the friend who hosted the party, neither of us remembers much that night, he's absolutely horrified and has no idea who did it. I can't get myself to watch the video, but he has and says he can't recognize who's in it with me. \n\nI don't know what to do, I feel cornered and violated. I've considered getting the police involved, but I'm scared that they won't do much since I was drunk. Not to mention the sheer embarrassment of everyone I know seeing that video. I'm also worried about retaliation from whoever did this. \n\nIf anyone has any advice or support I would appreciate it, thank you.\n",
    "Hey everyone, \n\nJust wanted to seek some advice regarding anxiety. For the past few months, I've been dealing with a substantial amount of stress and anxiety almost daily. I think its sources are mostly from work and personal life, and from the ongoing pandemic situation, which isn't showing any signs of abating soon. \n\nI often experience symptoms like a pounding heart, an upset stomach, sweating, and sometimes even panic attacks. These often leave me feeling drained and tired every day, and it's severely impacting my quality of life, not just mentally, but physically as well. \n\nThe constant worry and fear of what's going to happen next is driving me up the wall, and it's becoming increasingly difficult for me to concentrate on my work or other activities. I've tried handling it myself through relaxation techniques like deep breathing, yoga etc., but so far it hasn't helped much.\n\nI understand that professional help is the best way forward, but I just wanted to see if there are any other steps I can try before taking that route. Perhaps there are people here who have been through the same and can lend some advice based on their experiences?\n\nI'm open to suggestions about coping mechanisms, exercises, lifestyle changes, or even books and resources that might help with anxiety management. Please do keep in mind that although I'm heavily inclined toward natural and self-help solutions, I'm not averse to seeking professional help if needed. \n\nThanks for reading, and I appreciate any advice you guys might have for me!\n\nStay safe.",
    "It's interesting to take a step back and reflect on how much the world has evolved over the past five years. I've scrolled through social media, news articles, and personal memoirs to compile a noteworthy list of changes we've experienced.\n\nFirst off, let's start with technology. Five years ago, virtual voice assistants like Alexa and Google Home were still very much in their infancy. Now, they've become such an integral part of our lives, helping us with everything from managing schedules to controlling our home's lighting. Drones, virtual reality, and electric cars weren't as ubiquitous as they are today either. Tech giants have truly redefined our lives in the last five years.\n\nIn the world of social media, the popularity of platforms has seen a shift. While Facebook and Twitter remain popular, Instagram, and the newbie, TikTok, have taken the social media world by storm. They've shifted the paradigm of how content is created and shared, paving the way for new influencers and trends.\n\nGlobal politics has also gone through major changes. New leaders have emerged and policies have shifted, sparking global debates and redefining political alliances. The geopolitical landscape of 2016 looks unrecognizable now.\n\nRegarding our environment, there has been a substantial surge in awareness about climate change and the importance of sustainable living. More people are transitioning towards plant-based diets and eco-friendly products which was not that prevalent half a decade ago.\n\nLastly, a mention of the last five years would be incomplete without acknowledging the unprecedented pandemic. Covid-19 has revolutionized all facets of life, from work to education to social interactions, bringing about the birth of a \"new normal\".\n\nAll these changes are a testament to the fact that the only constant in life is in fact - change. It would be fascinating to imagine what the next five years will bring!",
    "Hello to everyone in this wonderful community! As the title suggests, I am fairly new to the path of Paganism and Witchcraft. I've recently found myself yearning for a higher spiritual connection and journey, and this path seems to deeply resonate with me.\n\nWhile I'm still very much in the exploration phase, I've been increasingly feeling pulled towards deity. I find myself drawn to meditation, rituals, and the overall allure of divine beings without exactly knowing why. It feels as if something is urging me to discover and potentially form bonds with them, as if I'm being called to connect on a deeper spiritual level. However, as intriguing as this feeling is, it's also quite daunting.\n\nThe practice of deity work is new to me and quite honestly, I feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of deities out there. I am uncertain about how to approach this, and how to know which deity or deities might be calling to me. Furthermore, what procedures should I consider to honor and interact with them faithfully, respectfully and safely? Is there a specific etiquette I should be aware of?\n\nI'm also concerned about deciphering my logs, dreams and synchronicities correctly. How do you discern if these are actual messages or merely random acts?\n\nPlease, any insights, advice, experiences or resources that could help me navigate this would be deeply appreciated. This is a journey I am excited to embark on, and striking a conversation with others more experienced than me could potentially offer me perspective and reassurance.\n\nI'm grateful for any guidance you can offer. Thank you for taking the time to read this post. Blessed be.",
    "Hey everyone, \n\nI hope you'll be understanding and open-minded about what I'm going to share here. It's kind of a unique thing about me that I've come to terms with, but I am curious to hear if others feel the same or have any insights.\n\nA little background to start: my girlfriend and I have been together for some time and I absolutely adore her. Our relationship is beyond stable and we communicate about everything under the sun, including our deeper, and perhaps, less conventional desires.\n\nRecently, I've realized something a bit strange about myself. I feel really turned on and I actually enjoy the act of making love more when I know that my girlfriend is fantasizing about other guys. I know, it could be interpreted as weird or unusual, but that's just how I am. I don't feel jealous or insecure about the idea, rather, it somehow makes the act more exhilarating for me. And trust me, we've established boundaries and she respects them just as much as I respect hers.\n\nI'm quite okay with this element of our relationship, but I'm curious if anybody else out there has had similar experiences? How did you handle it? How did it affect your relationship? I suppose I'm just seeking to understand this better and see if there are ways it could be explored further, while keeping our relationship healthy and respectful.\n\nAny thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'm well aware that Monster Hunter games are known for their multiplayer aspect, and I'm worried I might not be able to enjoy the game fully if I go at it alone.\n\nI'm looking for some advice from people who have any experience playing Monster Hunter Rise solo. Is it still a fun and challenging game when played alone? Are the missions too difficult for a single player? Does the game offer a satisfying experience for solo players?\n\nAlso, does the game make any allowances for solo players like perhaps adjusting the difficulty depending on the party size, etc.?\n\nLastly, if anyone could also share how the game compares to other Monster Hunter titles in terms of solo playability, that would also be a great help.\n\nLook forward to hearing your thoughts.

    "I appreciate this platform as a place where people can come and vent, share experiences, learn, and ultimately be part of a collective. Today, I want to talk about a frustration that I am guessing many of you can relate to, one that really tests my patience, namely: the silent treatment.\n\nHow is it that in the 21st century, where we have tools and platforms for communication so advanced and diverse, some people still resort to giving the silent treatment instead of sharing or discussing their feelings and thoughts? When faced with such behaviour, I find it truly flabbergasting. The silent treatment often escalates miscommunications, assumptions, and wrong-doings because no one is stepping forward to clear the air or explain their side.\n\nWhat's worse is that this \"weapon\" is exercised not only in interpersonal relationships but also in professional settings. You've made a mistake, instead of communicating and rectifying the issue, your superior or coworker suddenly starts treating you like you're invisible. The key to resolving any issue lies in conversation, not avoidance.\n\nI conclude this post by urging everyone who reads it to communicate instead of closing off. Silence may be golden, but not when it sows the seed of misunderstandings and conflicts. \n\nRemember, a problem talked about is a problem half-solved. Please share your thoughts on this.",
    "I have always been fascinated by my family’s lineage, particularly my Romani heritage. My grandmother used to share stories from her childhood and the beautiful traditions and practices associated with Romani culture. Sadly, my connection to this heritage was lost over generations, and these practices were no longer passed down or sustained in my immediate family.\n\nHowever, recently I have been feeling a strong calling to reconnect with this part of my ancestry. I have been considering learning more in-depth about the Romani culture, its language, history, folklore, and partaking in its traditions and practices. I believe that honoring and keeping alive my ancestral culture is an excellent way of preserving it for future generations. Moreover, I feel it's a deep standard of respect for my ancestors who could not openly express their culture due to societal repression & prejudices.\n\nDespite my personal feelings, some of my friends have expressed their concerns and reservations about this. They argue that focusing on a culture like this is considered ‘cherry picking’ or even a form of cultural appropriation, as I did not grow up within the Romani community. \n\nWhile I understand their viewpoints, I can’t help but wonder if it’s wrong to want to connect to a part of my heritage that I feel has been lost to me. I am quite torn between my desire to know more about my cultural roots, and wanting to respect current perspectives on cultural identity and appropriation.\n\nIs it wrong of me to want to learn about and partake in my ancestral Romani culture? I would genuinely appreciate any insights or perspective on this. Thanks!",

    "Hello everyone,\n\nAs a newcomer in caring for an ant farm, I have a few questions and am looking for guidance after an unfortunate incident. \n\nSeveral days ago, I found my ants dead in their terrarium. I had been passionate about creating the perfect habitat for them and was devastated. I don't understand what went wrong and desperately need help figuring it out.\n\nHere's a bit about how I've been caring for them:\n\nI kept them in an enclosed ant terrarium, ensuring they had sufficient space to move around. I maintained a consistent temperature of around 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit and kept the enclosure in an area where it received moderate indirect sunlight.\n\nAs for their diet, I provided them with an array of sweet food, protein, and water. For instance, I occasionally gave them small pieces of fruits, honeydew, and mealworms. I tried to maintain a balanced diet for them and ensured that their food was fresh. Additionally, I provided water through a test tube setup to prevent excessive moisture.\n\nI know ants require some downtime during the winter months, but I didn't hibernate them since the species (Lasius niger) I was keeping does not need hibernation when kept indoors. \n\nDespite these efforts, they died. I'm really upset and at a loss for what might have happened. Have I missed something critical in maintaining the ants' housing or diet? What else should I be monitoring or adjusting to ensure their health and well-being? \n\nIf there are any common newbie mistakes that might be causing this, please let me know. Also, any recommended resources or advice for first-time ant-keepers would be highly appreciated. \n\nI want to try again and give ants the care they deserve. I eagerly await your advice.\n\nThank you in advance.",
    "So, just like many of you, I've found myself down many rabbit holes, investigating AoT and its sudden end. The abrupt tone shift, the character inconsistencies, the loose ends, it just didn't feel like AoT. It frustrated me, as I believed so deeply in Isayama’s storytelling and character development.\n\nI began looking back into past interviews and panels to see if Isayama ever mentioned anything about how he planned on ending Attack on Titan.\n\nAnd surprisingly, there were numerous instances where Isayama's comments did not line up with the end we were presented with.\n\nThe most significant being his infamous 2013 interview in which he stated that he had planned a 'traumatic' ending similar to Stephen King's 'Mist.' Another instance was in the August 2020 Bessatsu Shonen Magazine interview where he stated that the current finale we got was the result of him wanting to reject the idea of a \"tragic hero\" ending. Not to mention, he had already planned out AoT's ending by 2018. However, the narrative shift hinting towards AoT’s final ending happened only in 2019, way after 2018.\n\nAll this and much more make it very evident that the ending we got isn't what Isayama had originally thought of. The Isayama we know is a master of handling narratives with multiple layers of complexity, and to just leave us with such a simplified version, it just does not add up. \n\nThis is not to say that we should disregard the current ending or launch campaigns demanding a \"better\" ending. No, not at all. Isayama has given us the right to perceive the story with our own interpretation. \n\nLooking at all this, it simply comforts me to know that Attack on Titan, the story I had invested in, was meant to end differently. It provides closure to my frustration and helps me reconcile with the final chapters.\n\nRegardless of our varied opinions, I think one thing that unites us all is the profound love and respect we have for Isayama and his creation. So here's hoping for more clarity and resolution in the future! Let’s continue supporting and appreciating AoT in all its glory.\n\nLet's be thankful for the journey that Attack on Titan has taken us, and let's see what the future holds. Trust in the process, trust in Isayama.",

Maybe someone out there can resonate, advise or provide some much needed solace.\n\nI have always been introverted and found it hard to make meaningful connections with people. Since my childhood, the process of making and retaining friends has been quite arduous for me. Given my shy, introverted persona, I was basically always the odd one out in any social group. But amidst all this, there was one person who stood by me.\n\nShe was more than just a friend to me, someone who truly seemed to understand me. A person who saw the reticent boy behind the introverted facade, someone who despite my countless flaws and eccentricities, loved me for who I really was. She was my constant, my guiding star, the one who made everything around me feel less intimidating.\n\nRecently, however, I've noticed a shift in her behaviour. She barely texts me, our conversations have become sparse and uninteresting. The spark that used to light up our discussions, the comfort we found in our shared solitude has seemingly vanished into thin air.\n\nI tried talking to her about it, and she confirmed my fears. She told me that she just doesn't feel the same way anymore, that she was no longer able to value our relationship as she used to. I can't really explain how devastated that made me feel.\n\nMy one person, the only person who made me feel seen and cared for, doesn't seem to care for me anymore. I feel untethered and lost all over again. \n\nDealing with this loss feels overwhelming, and I can't help but feel like I've somehow brought this upon myself. I could really use some advice on how to handle this situation. I apologise if this post isn't very coherent, my thoughts are rather scattered at the moment. I just couldn't think of anywhere else to unload these feelings.",

They have to be responsible for handling disputes, issuing warnings, and making important decisions that can impact the community as a whole.\n\nIt's great to see young people take interest in online communities, there's nothing wrong with that. But being a moderator is a different ballpark. It requires a level of maturity and thorough understanding of both the platform and the user base which, no offense, I doubt a 15-year-old would possess.\n\nDoes anyone else share the same concerns? Let's discuss this openly. If it turns out that the age of the mod isn't a significant factor in preserving the quality of subreddits they run, I'll be the first to admit my skepticism was wrong. But, for now, I'm seriously considering looking for another subreddit if this is going to be the new norm.\n",
    "Overthinking about what to say in conversation is a common experience shared by many. It's usually spurred by anxiety or fear of being judged by others and can often lead to missed social opportunities or feelings of regret. Here are a few strategies that may help you feel more at ease in social situations and improve the flow of your conversations.\n\n1. **Practice Mindfulness:** Mindfulness involves focusing on the present moment and accepting it without any judgment. It can be a very effective way to manage overthinking. Next time you find yourself in a conversation, try to focus solely on the current dialogue, the topic discussed, and the person you are talking to at that moment.\n\n2. **Prepare and Educate:** If you're nervous about a particular meeting or social gathering, prepare by brainstorming potential conversation topics. Keeping yourself informed about news, pop culture, or relevant topics can give you a fountain of topics to draw from.\n\n3. **Allow Silence**: It is natural for conversations to have occasional pauses. Do not fear silence or feel the burden to always fill it. Sometimes, silence gives others the chance to process, think and contribute to the conversation.\n\n4. **Listen Actively:** Conversations aren't just about speaking; listening is arguably even more important. Focus on what the other person is saying, ask relevant questions and show empathy. This can often lead the conversation naturally without you having to do too much of the talking.\n\n5. **Be Authentic:** Remember to express your truth. People generally appreciate honesty and authenticity. You don't have to know everything or have a comment on every topic. It's okay to admit if you don't know much about a certain subject.\n\n6. **Practice, Practice, Practice:** The more you expose yourself to social situations, the more comfortable you'll be when conversing. Start with small groups and work your way up. With time, this can significantly reduce your anxiety and allow you to feel more at ease. \n\n7. **Seek Professional Help:** If overthinking is causing significant distress, consider seeking help from a professional, such as a psychologist or a skilled therapist. They can provide you with more personalized strategies and tools to cope with these situations.\n\nReframing your attitude towards conversations and applying these techniques can alleviate the stress associated with social interactions. Remember, improvement takes time, patience, and practice, so don't be too hard on yourself when progress seems slow.",
    "Last week I had a somewhat heated disagreement with a girl I had been talking to for a while. Our communication was kind of seamless before and we had a good balance of initiating conversations. However, ever since we had the argument, I've noticed that she won't initiate a conversation anymore. It's always me who has to text first. This doesn't sit well with me because it feels rather one-sided.\n\nDuring our argument, our voices never raised and it ended with an agreement to disagree, although feelings were evidently hurt on both sides. It wasn't of course a dispute of 'deal-breaker' magnitude. I've since apologized to her, acknowledging where I might have been wrong and she accepted my apology.\n\nThough, ever since the argument, like I said, it's always me that starts the conversations, something that didn’t happen before. It's making me really anxious and unhappy. Has anyone faced a similar situation or has any advice on what to do moving forward? Could this be her way of expressing her hurt or remaining anger? Please share your insights!",
    "The rule that employees must get a doctor's note for being out sick always seemed a bit excessive to me. If an employee is sick, we surely want them to rest and recover, not further exhaust themselves by dragging themselves to a doctor's office just to get a written excuse. And let's not forget about the fact that this potentially exposes others at the medical center to the illness, and puts additional strain on our healthcare system.\n\nNot to mention that many folks might not have the time, money, or resources to see the doctor every time they have a minor illness that can be otherwise recovered from at home with proper rest and over-the-counter remedies. It seems like the healthcare system is already overburdened as is, without folks having to take time off work to make unnecessary doctor visits.\n\nAnd lastly, I think it's also worth considering that making this requirement might discourage sick employees from even taking a day off. This potentially endangers others in the workplace and can significantly hinder recovery and productivity. It seems to me like it would be more beneficial to trust employees when they say they're sick and encourage them to stay home and recover instead. \n\nWhat are your experiences with this? Are there alternatives that could work better?",
    "If you're setting up your own garage gym or debating whether to take the leap, there are some standards which need to be maintained. Here's a compiled list of things to consider:\n\n1. **Space:** Even a minimal garage gym needs ample space. Consider space not only for equipment but also for movement during workouts. Ensure there's enough headroom for overhead workouts and sufficient wall space for the likes of wall balls or any mounted equipment. \n\n2. **Ventilation:** Proper ventilation is important to ensure you're not suffocating in your own workouts. Look for adequate airflow systems or any form of window or garage door opening.\n\n3. **Safety:** An essential aspect when setting up any sort of gym. Make sure the equipment has safety fixtures where necessary, like safety arms for a power rack. Use high-quality mats for floor safety, especially where heavy weights are concerned.\n\n4. **Equipment Quality:** You get what you pay for. Buying cheaper equipment will save you money initially, but as the saying goes \"buy cheap, buy twice\". Find equipment that's robust and will last, it doesn't have to be the most expensive but quality does matter.\n\n5. **Flooring:** This plays a crucial role in any gym. Not only does it provide safety but also adds to the longevity of your equipment. A popular, effective choice is horse stall mats.\n\n6. **Lighting:** Adequate light is essential, not just for atmosphere but for safety. Consider natural light, overhead lights or even workout-specific lighting.\n\n7. **Organization:** This goes for tiny spaces and larger ones. Each piece of equipment should have its own place. This reduces risk of accidents and helps to maintain the equipment.\n\n8. **Noise Considerations:** A garage gym isn’t as insulated as a commercial gym. Be aware of the noise your workouts generate, especially if you have neighbors close by. Look for equipment that produces less noise, or consider soundproofing options.\n\nRemember, a garage gym is an investment, not only in terms of finances but also in your health and wellbeing. Prioritize quality and safety over saving a few bucks, and your future self will thank you.",
    "So I am currently working at a mid-sized company and have been here for almost 2 years. My initial contract had an agreement that after a year, I'd be up for a salary review and potential pay rise. In that year, we had an increase in office budget, more projects taken on, and I took on more responsibilities. \n\nThe review happened a couple months late, but it did happen, except, when I asked about the salary increase, my HR manager would always evade the question. I tried to ask her subtly, directly, and even mentioned it to higher-level management. Nothing. \n\nEventually, after carefully researching my role and potential pay in the job market, I went back to HR presented them with this information and asked for a pay rise. Their response was, \"We need to evaluate it further\". A few days later, I get an email with a revised contract instead of a range or negotiation. Just an amount—an increase of a meager 1.5%. \n\nFrustrated with the secrecy and lack of negotiation, I asked HR to at least share with me the salary range for my position. Not an unreasonable request, right? Well, the head of HR flat-out said NO. Not a maybe, not a 'let me get back to you', a definitive NO. \n\nWhat's worse, I noticed after this meeting that the HR department started acting really petty towards me. Things like excluding me from certain email chains, not taking my feedback onboard, and scheduling my appointments last. I feel this is out of spite because I asked for a salary raise that was initially promised to me.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience with their HR department or do I have just the most ridiculously petty HR in the world? What should I be doing in this scenario? I enjoy what I do and the colleagues I work with, but this whole situation with HR is souring my working experience at this company. Any advice would be highly appreciated. Thanks!",
    "Last month, I bought an electronic gadget from a seller via eBay. I had to pay with PayPal since that was the only option available. Long story short; my package never arrived. I contacted the seller, but they insisted it had been shipped. So, after waiting a reasonable amount of time, I decided to escalate this issue to PayPal. PayPal investigated the case and decided in my favor. They refunded the total sum I had paid for this gadget. \n\nFast forward to today, the seller reached out to me via email, insisting that I owe them money for the gadget because the package was lost in transit and it wasn't their fault. They’re demanding that I pay the entire amount that I originally paid for the gadget. \n\nNow, I'm pretty confused. Is that a common practice? Does the seller have any legal grounds to ask me to repay them even though PayPal refunded me due to the fault from their (seller) end? Isn't the seller supposed to have insurance for situations like these? \n\nAnyone with a similar experience or advice on handling this issue would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",
    "For context, I recently signed a year-long lease with a new roommate, who seemed like a perfectly normal person initially. We got along pretty well and divided household chores evenly. All things ran smoothly until I discovered his utterly revolting morning routine.\n\nSo, it's been a few weeks since we've moved in together, and I keep hearing this bizarre gagging noise coming from our bathroom every morning. At first, I just assumed he was sick or having some stomach troubles. But when it persisted for a few days, I got worried and asked him if he was feeling okay.\n\nWith the most nonchalant expression on his face, he admitted that he deep-throats his toothbrush every morning. Yes, you read that right. He, fully aware, chokes himself with his toothbrush daily. Apparently, according to him, it's his unique way of ensuring he cleans every bit of his mouth, including the throat.\n\nIt's not only the disgusting sound that gets to me but also imagining someone doing that to themselves is outright horrifying. I'm usually not the one to judge someone’s personal hygiene habits, but this is beyond my comprehension.\n\nI'm now stuck with this person for a whole year. I can't bring myself to confront him—it's his personal hygiene, and it seems pretty touchy to tell someone how to brush their teeth. Tips on how to navigate this awkwardness would be appreciated. I've tried using earbuds, but the gagging noise haunts me to my core and seems to penetrate any noise barrier. \n\nTo all would-be roomies out there, maybe include \"how do you brush your teeth?\" in your list of questions when screening roommates. I certainly will from now on. Anyway, just wanted to share my cautionary tale.",

    "I need some help navigating a difficult conversation with my 14-year-old daughter. My wife passed away unexpectedly from a heart condition last month and it's been a tough grieving process for both of us. \n\nMy daughter has been acting out, isolating herself, and she's starting to fall behind in school. I've tried talking casually with her, attempting to coax her into discussing her feelings, but she just shrugs it off and seems to retreat even more. And I completely get it, I truly do. I'm still dealing with my own grief, so I can only imagine how hard it is for her.\n\nThis weekend, I've decided to have a more open and honest chat about her mother, her feelings, and how we both are coping with this loss. I want to reassure her that it's okay to grieve and it's okay to talk about her mom. \n\nAny advice regarding what to say or how to approach this delicate topic would be greatly appreciated.

Tips on books to read, activities to pursue, or therapists specialized in teenage grief would be very helpful too. \n\nThank you in advance, your guidance will mean the world to both of us.",
    "Hey everyone, \n\nI've been a lurker on this subreddit for a quite while now, and only recently have I started to actively participate in discussions. I've posted several threads, replied to the posts of others and generally try my best to interact within this community.\n\nI love the content here and I feel like it syncs with my interests, but there's something that's been preventing me from enjoying my experience completely. Mainly, I just feel very... alone. I don't mean that in a depressive way necessarily, but more as though I'm not really connecting with anyone.\n\nI see a lot of camaraderie here, lots of people chatting to each other, and a general sense of friendship. I see in-jokes flying around, people referencing other community members, etc. Yet, it seems like I'm standing on the outside, watching through a window.\n\nI don't blame any of you for this. It's clear there are strong bonds formed through shared interests and experiences here, and I wouldn't expect anyone to simply let me into their social circle immediately. I suppose I'm just a bit confused on how to engage on a more personal level within this community.\n\nIt's quite probable that I'm completely overthinking this, as that is something I tend to do, but I would appreciate any advice on how to 'fit in'. Is it just a matter of time? Or should I make more of an effort to connect with people on an individual level? \n\nI don't want it to seem like I'm complaining or that I don't appreciate this community, because I really do. I just want to be a part of it in a more meaningful way. Thanks for reading, and I look forward to engaging more with all of you.",
    "As a PC gamer, I've had my share of arguments with console gamers, but I want to clarify some things so we can reduce the toxicity in our community. Arguably, everyone's got their preference and that should be respected. \n\nFirst off, let me tell you that performance arguments including frame rates, load times, and the superior customization only PC gaming allows (from graphic settings to mods) give the PC platform a clear edge over consoles. This doesn’t mean console games can't have amazing graphics or good frame rates - I just acknowledge the potential for PC to excel in these areas.\n\nSecondly, PCs afford a diverse range of games that consoles can't match due to the open nature of the platform. It’s not down to exclusivity; it’s the sheer quantity of games available. \n\nAnd third, as a gamer, you should be able to appreciate the beauty of cross-platform play. It brings together gamers from different platforms, thus creating a bigger, more diverse, and entertaining gaming community. \n\nWhether you game on a console or a PC, it's all about the thrill, the excitement, and the enjoyment video gaming brings us each day. I won't lie, discussions can be fun and educational, but when we start disrespecting each other as gamers, it’s crossing a line. It doesn’t matter what you play on, we’re all gamers at the end of the day.\n\nIn conclusion, my intention with this post wasn’t to bash console players, it was to highlight some advantages of PC gaming and to encourage a respectful discussion amongst ourselves. As gamers, we should always strive to foster understanding and unity within the community rather than creating divisions or hostility. Enjoy your games, no matter what platform you play on. Game on, friends.",
    "I've always envisioned adopting children. Since I was a teenager, whether I've been in a relationship or single, I've had this resolute notion that there are so many children in the world who need a loving home that I would prefer to adopt rather than have biological children. \n\nMy friends and family often say this is a radical viewpoint. They argue that there's something natural, almost innate about the desire to have biological kids. They talk about the bond, about passing on genes, about seeing a blend of you and your partner in your child. Some of them are even worried about the 'complications' that might come with the adoption process or the potential issues that come with raising a child who isn't biologically yours. While I understand where they're coming from, I just feel the desire, the pull towards adoption.\n\nSo, is this a crazy perspective to have? I realize it's unusual, but is it fundamentally flawed in any way? Are there others who share this viewpoint with me? Any adopted people or adoptive parents who can share their experiences?\n\nPlease help me understand the different dimensions of this perspective. I'd appreciate any thoughts, experiences or insights you could share!\n",
    "I guess everyone here has their own version of \"the worst thing about this\", but I just needed to vent about mine. For me, it's definitely the incessant feelings of helplessness.\n\nEvery day, it seems like something new is going wrong and there's nothing I can do about it; it's like I'm stuck watching a car crash in slow motion, unable to turn away or intervene. The sinking feeling in my stomach is constant - a heady cocktail of anxiety, frustration, and despair.\n\nI've tried everything - talking it out, immersing myself in work, resorting to distractions, but nothing seems to make a dent. The more I try to fight it, the stronger it grows. I know that everyone's dealing with something or the other, and every problem certainly feels insurmountable when one is in the middle of it. But it's just overwhelming right now.\n\nSome days I'm able to put on a brave face and carry on as if everything's normal, but other days, the facade slips and all I want to do is hide away from everything, curl up in a ball, and cease to exist.\n\nI'm sharing this here, not for pity or advice (though if you're willing to share your coping strategies, I won't turn it down), but because I just needed to get it out. To put it out there in the universe so at least it has somewhere to go besides constantly circling around in my thoughts.\n\nSo here's to better times, better feelings, and an end to \"the worst thing about this\".

    "I'd like to share my recent crypto journey with you all, mainly praising two platforms, Quickswap and Moonwolf.io, which allowed me to fully understand the potential of Polygon Layer 2. \n\nIn the past months, I noticed the high gas fees on CB were eating away my profits. I was constantly on the hunt for a cheaper and efficient alternative. That’s when I came across Polygon (previously known as Matic Network) which has emerged to be a key player in the Ethereum scaling solutions. The cherry on top was discovering Quickswap and Moonwolf.io operating on this network. \n\nQuickswap offers exactly the same as Uniswap, but with near-zero gas fees and super-fast, I mean, blink-and-you'll-miss-it fast transactions. It's given me the ability to exploit trading opportunities without worrying about the transaction fees, which used to be a deal breaker on CB. \n\nMoonwolf.io, on the other hand, has piqued my interest by being deflationary and having automated liquidity provision. My faith in the project soared after they burned 50% of the total supply. Plus, they have quite an active community which is a bonus. \n\nTransitioning to Polygon L2 has been an excellent move on my part. Apart from just low fees, the entire process has become hassle-free. It has encouraged me to get more involved in the DeFi space and the crypto world in general. I'm making more transactions now than ever, and the fact that the profits are not being sliced down by fees feels fantastic. \n\nFor anyone feeling the pinch of high fees on their transactions, I highly recommend checking out Polygon and the projects operating on it, like Quickswap and Moonwolf.io. The future of crypto definitely looks scalable and efficient with them. \n\nTo all my fellow crypto enthusiasts, always stay informed and make the best choices for your financial journey. Happy trading!",

    "Hello everyone,\n\nFirstly, let me start by acknowledging that I am not an expert on transgender issues, but I’m striving to learn more every day. My aim with this post is to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complexity of gender identity so that I could better support my transgender friends and stand up for them, especially if they are being attacked or invalidated. \n\nFrom my perspective, every individual, regardless of their biological sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, deserves the same level of equity and respect - something that seems like a basic human right. \n\nHowever, I have found myself in numerous situations where I'm unable to effectively counter aggressive transphobia, simply because there's a lot about the transgender experience that I don't understand. Though I try to offer evidence-based arguments, sometimes, it seems like my understanding is too shallow to engage in a truly substantive conversation. \n\nFor example, what is the best way to explain gender dysphoria to someone who's never experienced it? How can I lay out the scientific research on transgender identities in a layman's terms, especially to the people who refuse to believe that gender isn't binary?\n\nIt feels like I'm navigating through treacherous waters and I certainly don't want my ignorance to do more harm than good. It's really important for me to bridge this gap in my knowledge, in order to champion transgender issues more effectively and sincerely. \n\nIn order to deepen my understanding and to help others who may be struggling with allied advocacy, I'm asking for a bit of assistance. Could you kindly provide me with resources, materials, or any explanations that could offer a broader perspective on transgender experiences? \n\nI'm particularly interested in terms, concepts, and counter-arguments that would help me in debunks common misconceptions regarding transgender people regularly. \n\nI'd also appreciate it if you could help me understand the common challenges that trans people face personally and socially, and how could I, as a supporter, be a better ally. \n\nI am committed to understanding and supporting all transgender individuals in their journey and doing my part as an ally to promote a more inclusive and compassionate society.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and look forward to your insights and guidance.",

    "Okay, so I learned a painful lesson today when I decided to disassemble my Benchmade 940 for a full cleaning and minor upgrade. Spoiler alert: it didn't end well.\n\nYou'd think with all the usual disassembly and assembly videos on YouTube, it would be quite manageable. However, things didn't go quite as planned. The 940 is much more complicated than my previous knives. The axis lock mechanism alone, in combination with the omega and coil springs, can easily turn a seemingly simple disassembly into a nightmare.\n\nHalfway through, I realized that I was out of my depth. Multiple parts were incredibly hard to hold in place at the same time for the reassembly. More than once, the omega spring slipped and shot across the room. It was almost like the knife was telling me: \"Just clean me like normal and leave the inner workings to professionals.\"\n\nLesson learned the hard way. Unless you're significantly experienced in knife mods, or a professional knife-smith, I recommend thinking twice, nay thrice, before fully disassembling a Benchmade 940.\n\nIn the end, I had to take my disassembled Benchmade 940 to someone who knew what they were doing. Thankfully, the knife is now back together, working perfectly, but my pride took a bit of a hit.\n\nSave yourself the potential headache folks: Do surface cleanings, oil your pivot, take care of your blade, but don't feel the need to disassemble your knife entirely unless absolutely necessary!",
    "So, I was playing Destiny 2 the other day - one of my favorite games. I've been trying to get Charged With Light for quite a while and I read on several forums that rapid sidearm kills could give a high chance to get it.\n\nI usually don't go with sidearms, but I thought, let’s give it a shot.

I mean, I could not have been any faster with my sidearm, the word ‘Rapid’ couldn’t have been more justified in any other scenario. \n\nI'm just wondering if this happened to anyone else? Could there be a glitch that needs to be addressed? Are there any specific criteria or conditions that I'm potentially overlooking here, or is it pure bad luck?

    "I've been using Firefox as my primary browser for years now, and I love its speed, security, and general user-friendly design. But it does have one feature (or rather, lack of a feature) that consistently puzzles me: it cannot save a webpage to a setup PDF file while preserving the hyperlinks of the original page. Chrome and Safari have had this feature for ages, and there seem to be different add-ons and workarounds for Firefox, but none of them are particularly handy or satisfying.\n\nI can't count the number of times I've come across an article with important links and wanted to save it to a PDF for later viewing — links and all. Every time I encounter this problem, I get frustrated and start googling for a solution. The fact that this feature doesn't come straight out of the box like it does in other browsers is glaringly odd.\n\nMoreover, I've heard some reasons floating around online for why Firefox lacks this option, including that it's a byproduct of its focus on privacy and anti-tracking, since links could potentially be used to track users. But this seems a bit overblown to me. Wouldn't there be a way to implement hyperlink-saving while still maintaining user privacy?\n\nThis has been a gripe of mine for some time and was wondering if anyone else is encountering the same problem with Firefox? Does anyone have a satisfying solution that I've missed? Or could anyone shed more light on why Firefox is lacking this apparently simple feature?

    "Hey everyone, I have been a part of this community for over a year now and I felt the need to share my experience with all of you today. Over the past 6 months or so, I made great progress with my weight loss journey. I had lost around 45 pounds and was feeling better than ever. \n\nHowever, I recently went through a rough patch in life- a breakup, pressure at work, and a death in the family. I turned to food for comfort, and before I knew it, I was back to my old eating habits. Over the last few weeks, I've started to regain the weight I had worked so hard to lose. As of this morning, I am officially up 20 pounds. \n\nIt's so easy to feel like a failure in times like these, but I know that is not the correct mindset. We all have our ups and downs, moments of triumph, and moments of defeat. But I'm determined to view this as just a small setback and not a catastrophe. \n\nI am sharing this here because I've always found this community to be incredibly supportive. I'm not looking for sympathy, but for support, advice, and motivation from those who have possibly experienced similar setbacks. More than anything, I want to remind others that it's okay to fall off the wagon; what's important is that we find the strength to get back on it. Keep fighting, keep pushing, and never give up on yourself. And a sincere thanks to all of you for being such an inspiring community. I am ready to recommit and reclaim my progress. It feels good to have a safe space to share this, and I look forward to sharing my journey back to progression with you all.",
    "Hey there, thanks firstly for taking the time to read my post. I've been having a hard time lately, and I'm not quite sure how to handle what I'm going through.\n\nSo, it all revolves around my job. I've been working at the same place for around three years now. It wasn't my dream job or anything, but I was content because it paid the bills and my colleagues were decent people. Lately, though, things have taken a turn for the worse. We got a new manager a few months ago who is making my life a nightmare. He micromanages everything, undermines me in front of my team, and honestly just seems to have it out for me.\n\nI've tried discussing the issues with him, but it doesn't seem to get through. I've talked to HR but unfortunately, they haven’t been of much help either. It's causing huge amounts of stress and is seriously affecting my mental health.\n\nTo make things worse, I've looked into leaving, as many would suggest, but honestly, work in my field is hard to come by in my area, especially given the current economic conditions. I can't move because of family commitments and I don't really have enough saved to quit without another job lined up. \n\nIt feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I've never had to deal with a situation like this and it's affecting all aspects of my life. I've been having trouble sleeping, I've lost my appetite, I genuinely dread going into work every morning and it's just a struggle every day. \n\nI apologize for the long rant, but I just had to get it off my chest. If anyone's been in a similar position or can offer advice, guidance or even just kind words, I would really appreciate it. Thanks for listening.\n",
    "I am currently in a situation where I have a lot of credit card debt due to unfortunate life circumstances and impulsive spending habits. I've finally decided that this can't continue and it's time to take control of my financial health. I'm considering taking a loan to consolidate my several different debts which come with varying interest rates and payment dates. \n\nHowever, I don't fully understand if it's a practical solution or if it will just perpetuate my cycle of debt by shifting it from one lender to another. I've been researching and some financial experts suggest that debt consolidation loans may be a smart strategy if used correctly, while others recommend repayment plans or credit counseling instead.\n\nWould anyone who has experienced a similar situation or has knowledge about loans and debt consolidation care to weigh in? What factors should I consider while determining whether to take up a debt consolidation loan? Is there a possibility of falling into a bigger debt trap if I go down this path? \n\nSpecifically, I'm wondering about the terms and conditions I should watch out for, how this might affect my credit score, and better alternatives if any. I appreciate any advice you can give. \n\nPlease understand, I've learned my lesson and I'm trying to improve. Constructive advice only, please. Thank you.",
    "I've been sitting here for the past hour just trying to process what I've been through tonight and I finally decided that I needed to get it off my chest. I apologize in advance for the rant, but I honestly don't know where else to turn.\n\nTo be frank, tonight was something out of one of those horribly scripted comedy movies where things go from bad to worse until it's just absolutely ridiculous.\n\nSo I've had my eye on this new restaurant in town, an Italian place that's been getting rave reviews. I'd gathered a group of friends to go and try it out. Little did we know, we were in for a disaster.\n\nFirst, they misplaced our reservation and we had to wait an additional 45 minutes before our table was ready. Then, the appetizers we ordered came out cold, as if they'd been sitting there for a while. When we brought this to the attention of our waiter, he looked more annoyed than apologetic. Regardless, we thought we would give them another chance with the main courses.\n\nAs fate would have it, two out of the five orders were wrong and one of my friend's meal came out a whopping 20 minutes after the rest of ours. When we tasted the food...it was downright awful.\n\nIt seemed like we were stuck in a streak of misfortune. Once the bill finally came, they had overcharged us, including dishes we hadn't even ordered. After another argument with the waiter – who by now I sincerely believe hated us – we managed to get it sorted, having wasted an additional half hour.\n\nUltimately, we ended up leaving with our appetites unsatisfied, feeling terribly frustrated, and vowing never to set foot there again. \n\nI've actually never had such terrible service and food at the same time. I'm really trying not to be overly critical or anything. Maybe it was just an off night for them, but it was honestly the worst experience. I'm just sharing my experience here so that others might be aware.\n\nAnyways, thanks for letting me vent. Here's hoping for a better dining experience next time!",
    "I've been in the VR&E program for approximately a year now, working towards my bachelor's degree, and I'm starting to contemplate the next step of my educational journey - obtaining a master's degree. My plan is to use the benefits available through the VR&E program; however, I've heard that in order to justify this, you really need to prove that your career goals require a master's level education.\n\nCurrently, I am majoring in Computer Science and I aim to pursue a career in Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML). From the research I've done and the professionals I've talked to, it seems quite clear that a post-graduate degree would enable me to secure higher-level positions or make meaningful contributions in these fields. Moreover, I've found numerous job postings requiring or preferring a master’s degree in these areas.\n\nIs seeking a master's degree through VR&E a realistic goal? If so, could anyone who has successfully navigated this process provide some insight or suggestions on how to best demonstrate the necessity of a master’s degree for my career aspirations? I am particularly interested in hearing about how you communicated with your VR&E counselor, and any evidence or documentation you used to support your request. Any advice you could give would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",
    "I came across a rather heartbreaking sight today while taking out the garbage. There was a tiny litter of newborn kittens abandoned in the dumpster, presumably by their mom. Not knowing their future if they were left alone, I decided to take them back home with me. But I've never cared for newborn kittens (or any pets, for that matter), so I'm fairly clueless here.\n\nThe little ones seem to be weak but are still managing to squirm around. Their eyes haven't opened yet, which I believe means they're very young. However, I'm not exactly sure how many days old they are. I'm currently keeping them warm with a cozy blanket since I read online that maintaining their body heat is essential. \n\nI understand that they will need to be bottle-fed but have no idea about what kind of milk formula I should use or how often I should feed them. Is cow's milk safe or should I purchase something specific? Also, what other steps can I take to improve their conditions and survival rate?\n\nI'm very willing to invest the time, effort, and resources necessary for their survival until they are old enough to be adopted or can survive on their own. I've already contacted a local animal shelter for information, but they told me their resources are spread thin at the moment. I'm waiting to hear back from them. \n\nShould I be checking with a vet immediately, even though they seem relatively stable right now? Are there any signs of distress or illness that I should be looking for in these early stages? I also want to keep them clean, but I'm unsure whether bathing them is safe or not.\n\nJust want some quick advice to safeguard the newborns for the time being. Any observations, expertise, or advice would be immensely helpful! It's my first time in a situation like this, and I would hate to see anything bad happen to them due to my lack of knowledge. I wholeheartedly appreciate any help.",
    "Hi fellow Redditors, \n\nIf you're experiencing hard start issues with your V Star 1100, I would like to share a few tips on how you can fix it yourself. Please note this is just a guide based on my own experience and I'm not a professional mechanic, so always consult one if you're unsure about anything.\n\n1. **Check your Battery**: A low or weak battery might cause a hard start issue. So the first thing you need to do is check the voltage on your battery. It should display a minimum of 12.6 volts; if the reading is lower, you need to charge it.\n\n2. **Clean your carburettor**: If your bike sits idle for long periods, it may potentially lead to a buildup of debris or hardened fuel in the carburettor. Make sure it's cleaned out properly. Clean the choke circuit as well while you're at it. You'd be amazed how much smoother your bike can run just with this simple job.\n\n3. **Inspect your starter**: Your bike's hard starting problem can be due to a worn-out starter. An easy sign of a faulty starter is a clicking noise when you press the ignition button.\n\n4. **Check your spark plugs**: A worn-out or dirty spark plug could also be causing the problem and changing your spark plugs can help in starting the engine quickly. This is a cheap solution and it wouldn't hurt to try.\n\n5. **Fuel and Air mix**: Make sure your bike's fuel and air mix is correctly adjusted. If your bike's mix is too rich, it can cause a hard start condition.\n\n6. **Compression**: Low engine compression is another common reason. To check it, you'll need a compression gauge. You ideally want a reading of around 140 to 160 psi.\n\nRemember, the solutions I mentioned above are a general guide, and the symptoms can vary. Also, it's always a good idea to consult a professional mechanic if you're unsure about anything.  \n\nI hope these tips help solve the starting problems with your V Star 1100. If anyone has other suggestions or tips or if you need further clarification, feel free to comment below. Happy Riding!",
    "After much contemplation, I decided to dive headfirst into the world of investing. My close friends kept buzzing about this phenomenal opportunity, and with their skyrocketing profits, the lure was too hard to resist. \n\nSo, I pulled together a thousand dollars, my total savings, scraped from part-time jobs and birthday gifts. Now, I wasn't entirely naive. I knew there would be risks involved; the undeniable truth is that there's no such thing as predictable returns. But I was willing to embark on this journey, thinking, 'No risk, no reward.'\n\nMy funds were transferred and ready to go, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I found myself caught up in a temporary bind that kept me away from leaping into the investment world. Those 3 days felt like the longest ones in my life. I was tormented with thoughts that I may have missed the golden opportunity, my ship might have already sailed. \n\nEventually, on the third day, I managed to invest my $1000 into the market. But I couldn't shake off the nagging feeling that those three days had cost me dearly. That had I done it sooner, I would've reaped greater benefits. The doubt about 'what could've been' sadly overshadowed the thrill of my first-ever investment.\n\nIn the end, I made some profit, but nowhere near what my friends did. I missed the initial boom, and it was a slow climb afterwards. It's hard not to think about how much more I could've earned if I had just been 3 days earlier. It's a lesson learned: not only in the volatile world of investment but also in the importance of timing. \n\nPerhaps it’s the initial disappointment that’s talking, but It feels almost like lottery timing - being at the right place (or right time, in my case) matters as much as, if not more than, the money you put in.\n\nI'm sharing this personal experience for anyone who is feeling regret for putting their funds late into an investment opportunity. Remember, investing is not a one-time event but a journey. It's always better later than never - and maybe ‘late’ could mean being right on time for the next opportunity. There's a whole lot of market movement waiting for us, and who knows, maybe missing the initial ride will make us more equipped for the next one.",
    "I apologize in advance if this post ends up being a bit lengthy or disjointed, it’s a complicated subject and I just need to get these thoughts out of my system. \n\nSo, I was recently diagnosed with depression by my therapist. And it wasn't a surprise, given the low moods and lack of enthusiasm for life that I've been experiencing for a pretty long time now. But there's something else that's been gnawing at me over time, and I've been hesitant to even mention this to my therapist for the fear of sounding absurd.\n\nI often find myself displaying tendencies that align with signs of a covert narcissist. I constantly question myself and my self-worth, yet I have this overwhelming need for affirmation and validation from others. There's this constant inner conflict, a constant tug-of-war between high and low self-esteem that's emotionally exhausting. And while I fit the classic symptoms of depression, like lack of energy, reduced concentration and others, these narcissistic tendencies seem omnipresent as well.\n\nI don’t mean to disrespect or trivialize either diagnosis, and I am not self-diagnosing as it's not healthy or productive—I just can’t shake this feeling that there’s something more complex going on in my mind. Has anyone else been through something similar or experienced these conflicting emotions? \n\nI am also aware that it is unwise and unsafe to seek medical advice online. But it would be comforting to hear from others who may have an understanding or experience with this perplexing feeling. \n\nSorry if this seems confusing or incoherent or if I improperly used any terms. Any advice or personal experience you could share would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.\n",
    "Having just graduated from college, I've been spending a lot of time reflecting on myself and the image I project onto others. I've realized that I don't have many hobbies that I can talk passionately about. Besides work and light reading, I don't engage in many activities that make me stand out. My weekends are generally spent at home, either watching TV or playing video games, and I don't have many exciting anecdotes or experiences to share with others. \n\nI have a limited social circle and most of my friends seem to have much more interesting lives than I do. They always have these captivating stories from their hiking trips, cooking experiments, or even just colorful tales from their daily life. And then there's me, feeling like a dull wallflower in consternation, trying to conjure up a response.\n\nThis isn't a huge issue in my daily life per se, but it becomes glaringly obvious in social gatherings, or even in online communities where interesting personal stories and experiences garner a lot of attention.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not unhappy - but I do want to be a more interesting person. I realize that it won't happen overnight, and I'm ready to put effort into it. What hobbies can I pick up that would make me more interesting to others and myself?

    "As we sit here tonight, chilling in this virtual space, I want to pour one out for all the homies that aren't with us anymore. They may be gone, but they're never forgotten. I know all of us here have lost people who were dear to us, friends who were like family. We laughed together, we argued, spent hours talking about nothing and everything, and created memories that will last a lifetime.\n\nTreasure those memories, my friends. Remember all the good times, all the bad times, and everything in between. Remember their smiles, their voices, the words they said, the way they made you feel. Let it bring a smile to your face and a warmth in your heart. It's okay to feel sad, to miss them. But let's not dwell on the loss, let's celebrate their life, and the fact that we were lucky enough to have known them, to have shared parts of our lives with them.\n\nI'll start. I want to remember my friend Jay. He was an amazing person, bright, energetic, funny, always ready with a joke or a word of encouragement when you needed it the most. He was the life of every gathering, a guy who could light up a room with his laugh. It's been three years since we lost him in a car accident, and I still miss him every day. But every time I remember him, I try to focus on the good times, the laughs we shared, the crazy stuff we did together. It helps, it really does.\n\nFeel free to share your stories, friends.

    "As many of you are aware, Rocks D Xebec is an influential and enigmatic character in the world of One Piece. He was not only the Captain of the Rocks Pirates, but also played an instrumental role shaping the brutal piracy ridden era before the Age of Pirates. What fascinates me is his importance in the narrative and the world building of One Piece.\n\nFor one, Xebec is credited with the menacing force of the original Rocks Pirates, which included formidable names like Whitebeard, Big Mom, and Kaido in its ranks. It underscores the nontrivial part he played in their development, shaping them into the recognized characters they are today.\n\nOne of the more intriguing aspects about Xebec is his untold history and its significance for One Piece's lore. The God Valley Incident, where Xebec was supposedly killed, shaped much of the world government's present attitude towards piracy and also gave rise to the Marines. It's interesting to speculate how Xebec's legacy will impact the future narrative.\n\nMoreover, the name \"D\" plays a vital role in the series, shared by main characters like Luffy and various others, leading to theories regarding their shared lineage or destiny. The inclusion of 'D' in Xebec's name raises questions about its significance and the bigger picture author Oda is trying to convey. \n\nLastly, Xebec's aspiration for becoming the King of the world and his audacity to challenge the world government's reign brings forth the themes of freedom, ambition, and rebellion widely spread throughout the series.\n\nIn essence, Rocks D Xebec's significance goes beyond his status as a powerful pirate. His influence, shrouded past, connections to the 'D' lineage, and the overarching symbolism embedded in his character add depth to the existing lore and provide insights into the upcoming turn of events in the world of One Piece. I am excited to see how his narrative continues to unravel as the series progresses.\n\nI'd love to hear your theories and thoughts about Xebec!",
    "So, here's my story. I'm just an average person, living an average life. No significant achievements, no groundbreaking accomplishments. I live in a small town, working a regular 9 to 5 job. I have family and friends, but no thrilling travel experiences, no cool hobbies. I'm pretty much invisible on social media, with barely any followers or likes, apart from a close-knit group.\n\nSome days, it stings, seeing people my age making it big, living the life I've only dreamt of. Other days, I'm content with my little bubble.\n\nBut lately, I've been feeling lost, as if I'm stuck in this void of nothingness. It's as if my identity and place in this universe have become insignificant. It's kind of scary, feeling like 'nobody', as if I don't make a difference in the grand scheme of things.\n\nBut then, isn't this what freedom is, in some twisted way? Having no identity or societal norm to live up to, no preconceived notions or hasty judgements, just me, in my raw form devoid of any labels. \n\nIs there anyone else out there who feels the same way? Can we cultivate this as our strength and just live our lives being 'nobodies'? Just throwing this out there to see if anyone else can resonate with these feelings. Any advice, thoughts, or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. Let's have a conversation, shall we?\n\nBeing 'nobody' can sometimes be liberating, but more often than not, it's just... lonely. Is the loneliness worth the freedom? \n\nMaybe being 'nobody' is okay, or maybe it's not. I'm just trying to figure it out. Thanks for reading, fellow redditors.",
    "Hello everyone!\n\nI've recently developed an interest in understanding more about the religion of Islam. I've always found the concept of religion absorbing in general, but Islam has piqued my interest more for several reasons - its vast followers, rich history, diverse cultures within, and unique practices.\n\nHowever, I've realized that an in-depth study and exploration about a religion as broad and comprehensive as Islam cannot be conducted without having a good understanding of the underlying structure and general ruling it operates on. There are many sectors, aspects, rules, and practices in Islam that one may need to grasp before delving deeper into this faith but I'm currently feeling a little lost about where to start.\n\nI'm keen on grasping the overarching schematic of this religion, which I hope will provide a structure for any additional learning about the various facets of Islam - the sects, the key teachings, various cultural practices and the jurisprudence that seems to be a huge part of this faith.\n\nCould anyone suggest me a roadmap for this exploration? It would be great if you could share some reliable sources of information as well. I add up that I'm particularly interested in knowing who the ultimate authority is in Islam?

    "Hello everyone, \n\nI've been carrying around this painful feeling for quite some time now and I wanted to finally address it and seek help. It's about my own perceived lack of intellectual ability. From a young age, I've had this nagging notion that I was less intelligent than the people around me. I can't seem to shake this feeling, and it makes me incredibly insecure. \n\nThis got even worse when I went to university. Everyone around me seemed to just 'get it', while I struggled to keep up. Simple things that my classmates would quickly grasp seemed confusing and daunting to me. I constantly worry about being discovered as some sort of \"fraud,\" someone who somehow managed to sneak into an institution they do not deserve to be in. This has led to me isolating myself from others, fearing that they would find out and ridicule me.\n\nThese insecurities have had an impact on my quality of life. I procrastinate on assignments due to fear of inadequacy, leading to last minute rushing and consequently poorer results. This, in return, reinforces my original fears of not being \"smart enough.\" It's a vicious cycle that I can't seem to escape from. \n\nI fully understand that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and not everyone is intellectually gifted. Nonetheless, I can't help but feel inadequate. This deep-seated fear seems to control my life, rather than me controlling it. Thinking about it logically, I know I shouldn't let it define me, but it's a lot harder in practice.\n\nHas anyone else been through a similar experience? How do you handle such deep-rooted insecurities and fears about one's intellectual abilities? I would be grateful for any suggestions, pieces of advice or even sharing similar experiences. \n\nThanks for reading.",

    "So, here we go again. Danielle demanding apologies that she may not necessarily deserve. I swear, if she had a dollar for every time she asked for an apology, she'd probably be a billionaire by now.\n\nDon't get me wrong, everyone deserves respect, that goes without saying. But the way Danielle always seems to feel victimized and seeks acknowledgment or validation is growing quite tiresome. It feels like every disagreement, misunderstanding, or difference of opinion has to end with someone apologizing to her, even when she holds her share of the blame. \n\nFurthermore, it's not like she graciously accepts these apologies either. It feels more like a game of collecting apologies rather than reconciling or resolving conflicts. On occasions when she is clearly in the wrong, it seems like an apology from her is almost impossible to come by.\n\nIn a community like this, we are bound to have clashes and differences.

Not to mention, this seems like a complete departure from what hunting should be - tracking and trailing your game, using your wits to outsmart it.\n\nOn the other hand, I can see how this could add an interesting strategic element to the game. Figuring out these spots and knowing when to use them could be part of mastering the game, and I know that there are some scenarios where animals become wary of these zones if there's too much hunting pressure. \n\nOn the whole though, it feels like drinking need zones are just a 'cheat code'. I wanted to know what everyone else thought about this. Do you think the devs need to nerf the drinking need zones in future updates or am I just imagining things? How does this affect your gaming experience? Would love to hear your thoughts!",
    "I'm sitting here tonight, my heart aching and mind racing, wondering if it's truly her that I miss or if it's merely the concept of the relationship we once shared. Part of me yearns for the cozy familiarity that was \"us\", the shared jokes, mutual understanding, and warmth that was present every time we spent time together. \n\nBut there's this other part, a rather rational one, that reminds me of the reasons why we parted, the differences that drove a wedge between us. Sometimes, it feels like I miss the companionship, the comfort of having another person completely understand me and my quirks, unconditional acceptance and a warm hand to hold. \n\nI'm confused and hurt. I don't know whether I miss her as a person or if my heart is mourning the loss of a relationship. The laughter, the shared meals, the movie nights, the walks.... Or maybe it's just the void of affection that I'm trying to fill with old memories. \n\nThis has become a sort of inner battle now. On one side, I'm trying to keep my distance, respecting the decision to part, understanding that it was for the better. On the other side, there's this incredible urge to mend things and get what was 'us' back. I'm in a tug of war with my feelings. It's like I was used to a certain degree of happiness, companionship, and warmth in my life, and suddenly it's all gone, replaced by a large gaping void.\n\nDo I want her back? Would things be different if we tried again? Or is it just the loneliness talking? Does anyone else struggle with this type of confusion? Just needed to vent and see if others are working through the same feelings. Thanks for reading.",
    "So I spent a good chunk of daylight yesterday outside, just basking in the wonderful weather that we're suddenly having. After being cooped up for most of the previous week, it honestly felt like paradise to feel the sun on my skin and hear the birds chirping again after such a long winter. \n\nNow here's the problem - during this blissful enjoyment, I completely disregarded one crucial fact: I have Polymorphous Light Eruption (PMLE). I was diagnosed a couple of years ago when I experienced some bizarre reactions after sun exposure. However, in my excitement, it completely slipped my mind.\n\nFor those who may not know, PMLE is a sort of allergic reaction to the sun. When the skin is exposed to sunlight, especially after a long time of not being exposed to the sun, it flares up and can lead to incredibly itchy bumps, blisters, and patches.\n\nJust wanted to share my situation with all here as a reminder to be aware and practice sun protection, especially if you have any sun-sensitive conditions. Adhere to necessary precautions such as using high SPF sunblock, wearing protective clothing, and limiting sun exposure.\n\nGuess who ended up with an awfully itchy, red, and bumpy rash all over the arms and legs? Yours truly! Now, I'm back to being indoors and applying topical creams while chugging anti-histamines to soothe this flare-up.\n\nSun, why do this to your biggest fan? Has anyone else had experiences with PMLE or other sun allergies? Would love to hear how you manage these and maybe get some tips!",
    "Hi everyone, \n\nI have been lurking around this sub for a while, and I finally decided to share my situation and get some insight from all of you.\n\nAbout six months ago, I entered into a relationship with this amazing person, let's call them Jamie. We both felt an instant connection. Jamie was upfront about being polyamorous from the beginning, something I've always been curious about but never actually explored. After some long, heartfelt conversations, I decided to give polyamory a try.\n\nWe are very candid about our feelings and always make sure to communicate. Jamie's other partner, Alex, is also wonderful. We've hung out a few times, and although it was awkward at first, now I genuinely look forward to it. There's no competition or rivalry; it's all about love and acceptance which is pretty refreshing.\n\nIt has been an incredible journey so far, and I feel that I am falling in love with Jamie more each day. However, as I navigate being in this polyamorous relationship, there's also a lot of uncharted territory I need to figure out.\n\nHow do you handle jealousy when it occasionally pops up? How do you ensure you're giving and receiving enough attention in your relationships? I am also having a hard time explaining this to my friends and family who grew up in monogamous households, and any advice on that would be amazing.\n\nOverall, I'm just incredibly grateful to have found this community. Reading your threads and posts has really given me the support I needed to explore polyamory. I look forward to your responses, and I'm excited to continue my polyamorous journey with Jamie and Alex.\n\nThanks for reading!",
    "Hi, fellow Redditors, \n\nI hope this post finds you all well. \n\nI was diagnosed with cervical cancer at 29 and underwent treatment for the same. It has been an emotional journey, filled with many ups and downs, but as of my last checkup, I'm currently 2 years cancer-free, and I couldn't be more grateful. \n\nMy partner and I have been thinking about starting a family. Before my diagnosis, having a family was always something that seemed to be in the cards for us. However, since the treatment, I've been taking time to focus on my health and ensuring I'm in the best possible shape for myself. \n\nGiven the potential effects of cancer treatments on fertility, I have apprehensions and concerns about my ability to conceive naturally. I have discussed these issues with my oncologist, but I don't feel like I've gotten the full picture. I know also that fertility isn't just affected by medical elements but also psychological and emotional aspects.\n\nI’m wondering if anyone here who has had a similar experience — dealing with cervical cancer and then considering pregnancy — can share their stories. I'm hoping to hear different perspectives on post-cervical cancer pregnancy, fertility struggles, and success stories. Any advice, resources, and encouragement would be greatly appreciated.\n\nPlease know that I'm not looking to replace medical advice with anecdotal evidence; each journey is unique. But sometimes it helps to talk with others in similar situations about their experiences and find reassurance in shared experiences. \n\nThanks in advance for your understanding and responses.",
    "I've been struggling with these feelings for quite some time now. I know I have them, they're real, I feel them in my bones. But sometimes, I can't help but compare my situation with those of others around me and the world at large often making me wonder if my pain, my feelings, are even valid to begin with. \n\nYou see, on the outside, my life may seem quite okay - I have a stable job, a supportive family, and a roof over my head. And yet, I am plagued with this constant sense of dread, sadness, and a feeling as if I'm drowning with no one to save me. But then, I look around me and I see those who are in conditions far worse than mine. Those who are facing homelessness, battling life-threatening health issues, dealing with severe poverty - and I simply can't help but feel my struggles, my pain, are insignificant, trivial even held up against theirs. Essentially, I find myself questioning if I have a right to feel depressed? \n\nIt's an ongoing internal struggle that essentially boils down to - is my pain less valid, less severe just because it may seem less in comparison to others? It's like being caught in a vicious cycle of feeling depressed and then feeling guilty for feeling depressed. I know, logically, that everyone's pain is different and all feelings are valid. But emotionally, it's hard not to invalidate myself sometimes.\n\nSo, I just want to reach out to the community here. Have you ever felt this way? That you don't have a right to feel depressed because there are people out there who have it so much worse than you? And for those who have experienced this, how did you overcome this guilt and self-invalidating thought? I'd really appreciate any advice or guidance. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",
    "So, this hilarious incident happened yesterday. I was at Home Depot wearing my usual casual attire, jeans and an orange polo shirt (big mistake). I was browsing through the aisle looking for some screws and bolts for a DIY project I've been working on.\n\nI noticed an older woman seemed to be watching me as I was comparing different items. She seemed lost and a bit frustrated. After a while, she timidly approached me, and said, \"Excuse me, young man. Could you possibly help me find the patio furniture?\"\n\nFor a moment I was confused until I realized she mistook me for an employee because of my orange shirt. Unable to suppress my chuckle, I decided to play along in a good spirited manner. I warmly said, \"Why of course, madam. Follow me please.\"\n\nSince I frequent the store to buy supplies for my DIY project, I knew exactly where the patio furniture was. We reached the aisle and I explained the difference between some of the sets. She seemed very pleased and thanked me profusely for the help.\n\nNeedless to say, I was more than happy to help her out. However, for future visits, I think I’ll stay clear of any orange clothing before stepping foot into Home Depot.\n",
    "Hello, fellow Redditors!\n\nI'm curious about the current state of Samsung's voice assistant, Bixby. When it was first launched, it seemed like everyone was giving it a shot, but now I rarely hear about anyone using it. I personally never found it as intuitive or helpful as Siri or Google Assistant, so I ended up disabling it on my Samsung phone.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone out there is still actively using Bixby. If so, what do you use it for? Do you find it as helpful as Google Assistant or Siri? I'm really curious to know your reasons and opinions, as I'm considering giving it another chance.\n\nThanks in advance for sharing your insights with me!",
    "I've recently made the decision to switch careers and I'm uncertain about what the smoothest way to make this transition would be. I don't want to burn any bridges at my current job as I do value the relationships I've built with my colleagues and supervisors. I would appreciate any suggested steps to undertake for a smooth transition. How much notice is typically considered as respectful to give? \n\nAdditionally, I'm interested in understanding how to maintain professionalism during the switch, particularly when asked about the reasons for my departure. How open should I be about my reasons for leaving? And what, if anything, should I communicate about my new job?\n\nSecondly, should I be open about my job search with my current employer or is it wiser to keep it under wraps until formalities with the potential new jobs are completed? \n\nI'm also wondering about what the general expectations are while handing over responsibilities. What are some effective strategies to ensure a smooth handover? Is there anything specific I should know in terms of legalities, like non-compete clauses or intellectual property agreements?\n\nI am aware that the answers might vary based on personal experiences and industry standards, but any advice or point-of-view would be appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",
    "I've been stewing over this for a while now and tonight seems like a good time to let it out. I just can't comprehend why people choose to inflict harm, disrespect, and engage in behavior that contributes to spreading negativity and pain. We all share this planet, live in the same communities, and experience many of the same struggles, so why can't we try to make life a little easier for one another?\n\nFrom petty crimes to massive sociopolitical injustices, the headlines are filled with stories about individuals causing harm to others. What happened to empathy, compassion, and basic respect for fellow human beings? Is this a reflection of our societies, or are we just naturally inclined towards negativity and hostility? And if it's the latter, what does that say about us as a species?\n\nI'm not saying we should all hold hands and sing kumbaya, nor suggesting that we're all horrible people. But it's increasingly hard to ignore the increased incidence of cruelty, prejudice, and selfishness that seems to be dominating our world. It's heartbreaking to witness people choosing to prioritize personal gains over the wellbeing of others.\n\nI don't have all the answers, far from it. But I feel like we could do so much better if everyone just invested a bit more effort into being kind, understanding, and respectful. If we tackled issues with the aim of helping others, instead of winning an argument or proving we're smarter.\n\nThis is just a tirade of disappointing thoughts, but maybe some of you feel the same way or have insightful views regarding what can be done to combat this growing hatred. Sometimes it feels like the world is unraveling, and I just wish we could remember that at the end of the day, we’re all human and in this together. \n\nSo, is my perception skewed, or are people becoming more horrible? And if so, what can we do about it? I'd really appreciate any thoughts or insights you might have on this.",
    "Hello, everyone!\n\nAs bizarre as it sounds, I have found an unusual identity which I've come to accept and associate myself with whole-heartedly - that of the famous comic strip character, Garfield. Don’t take it lightly, as I assure you, I'm quite serious. I'm not under any psychological delusion or trying to joke around, I genuinely feel a strong connection to my favoritest orange housecat.\n\nSure, I can't directly relate because I'm not an actual fat tabby cat hating on Mondays, consuming lasagnas, and fooling around with my owner, Jon Arbuckle. But, in the metaphorical sense, I am Garfield.\n\nTo me, this connection is more of an emotional and behavioral metaphor. I absolutely loathe Mondays; the pain is real, guys! It's like Garfield and I were cut from the same block of disdain for the start of the work week. Also, lasagna is indeed my favorite dish and I can eat it all day, every day, just like our grumpy feline.\n\nMoreover, you know how Garfield is generally portrayed with a sardonic sense of humor, with his quips and actions portraying a cynical and sarcastic lens of the world? Yeah, that's me alright. Sarcasm is my first language, and I revel in it just like our cartoon hero.\n\nI am unabashedly lazy, as Garfield is, finding equal joy and satisfaction in uninterrupted hours of sleep. Despite these lazy habits, I can be prankish and playful when the mood strikes much like Garfield with his silly exploits with Jon and Odie.\n\nThis post is not a futile attempt to seek attention or more upvotes. I simply felt the itch to share this intriguing side of my life, and finally decided to spill my guts. I somehow find comfort in connecting myself with a character that epitomizes my daily life. It's as if Garfield is a spirit animal to me, mirroring my emotions, behaviors, and rollercoaster of lethargic life. So yes, it might sound silly, but I am Garfield indeed. Just thought someone out there might find it interesting or even relatable.\n\nThanks for reading, fellow Redditors. Any thoughts? Ever felt like you are actually a cartoon character yourself? I'd love to hear about it! Let's share a laugh or a groan.",
    "I never thought I'd be posting here, venting about this topic, but here I am! It's been exactly two years since I last had sex. Now, this wasn't a religious choice or anything of that sort, nor was it an aim for celibacy. Life just happened to unfold in a way that led me down this sexually barren path. I guess I'd just like to provide some context, details about my journey, and maybe gain some insights or advice from you amazing people.\n\nFor background, I am a 27-year-old male who had a fairly active sex life up to this point. It started with the break-up with my long-term girlfriend two years back. The emotional turmoil and confusion took some heavy toll on me. While I eventually got back on track professionally and socially, my love life, unfortunately, did not follow suit.\n\nI tried to date, made profiles on numerous dating apps, asked friends to set me up, joined social and hobby groups but nothing clicked. It's not that I didn't meet women – I met quite a few actually. Some I found very attractive and interesting, but when it came to the point of progressing the relationship to a physical level, my mind just drew up a blank. \n\nI don't know if it's the emotional baggage from my previous relationship or my mind subconsciously protecting me from potential hurt in the future, but the simple thought of being physically intimate with someone else sets me on edge. It's not that I don't want to have sex – I do, but I feel stuck; trapped in this constant loop of desire and apprehension.\n\nI'm not sure if this is normal - this long dry spell, coupled with the anxiety towards intimacy. How do others navigate through it? If anyone had experienced something similar, how did you cope with it? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, Reddit.\n",
    "So I've been having this issue for about a week now. Every time I'm doing something on my PC, whether it's gaming, browsing or working, all of a sudden my screens go grey. It's not like a standard crash where the system becomes unresponsive, or the screens go black; instead, everything turns to a flat grey colour. I can still move my mouse around, but I can't click on anything or bring up the task manager.\n\nI've checked all my connections and they seem to be fine. I've also tried updating my graphics card drivers, but the issue persists. My PC is not particularly old (about 3 years), so I would think it could still handle the tasks I throw at it. The only solution currently is to press the restart button on my PC. Sometimes I have to forcefully shut down the PC as it won't restart normally.\n\nThis is unfortunately becoming more and more frequent. Initially, it was only once a day but now it happens multiple times per day. I have searched online for similar problems but didn't find anything that matches my symptoms exactly or provides a clear solution.\n\nMy PC specs are as follows: \n\n- Processor: Intel i5 7600k \n- Graphic card: Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB \n- RAM: 16GB DDR4 \n- OS: Windows 10 \n\nAny kind of help or advice to solve this would be really appreciated.

    "I've been trying to figure out a way to set up a motion-sensing switch to only work at certain hours of a day, specifically between 6 pm to 6 am. During this time, when anyone enters the room, the light should automatically switch on. However, I want the motion sensor to be deactivated from 6 am to 6 pm.\n\nI bought a motion sensor switch, but there seems to be no setting to restrict its operational hours. The sensor I own activates regardless of the time, which is not what I want. I guess other than disconnecting and re-connecting it manually, which is obviously not feasible, is there any other way to do this?\n\nI'm hoping maybe I could use some kind of timer system that can be linked to the motion-sensing switch somehow? Or some kind of a device I could plug the motion sensor into that could automate the on-off cycle on a daily basis? I'm fairly clueless on all things electric, so any advice on this would be much appreciated. \n\nAlso, if anyone knows of any specific motion-sensing switch models that already have this functionality built-in, that would be immensely helpful!\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who can help shed some light on this!",

    "I've been wrestling with this question for some time now, and couldn't just settle with the answers given by elders or leaders during Sunday sermons. I hope it'd be okay to discuss it here.\n\nIn almost all religions, worship in some form or the other is considered as an integral part of our relationship with the divine. Worship usually involves prayer, sacrifices, rituals, meditation, and sometimes even life-styles. But why exactly is there this requirement for worship? I mean, assuming God exists and He is indeed omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent, then why would such a deity require mortal creatures to affirm Its greatness through worship? \n\nI understand the argument about worship being a way of showing gratitude. Yet, it doesn't make sense to me why an omnipotent Being would need affirmation or validation? I also heard the argument that worship is more for us, for reflection and introspection. But can't that be achieved through other less ritual-centered means, like meditation or just deep contemplation? \n\nIt seems to me that if God is truly above all that is human and hence, beyond the confines of human comprehension, then the need for affirmation or validation would also be a novelty to God. \n\nBut, I am interested in learning what everyone else has to say about this. Do you think this requirement of worship is intrinsic to the very concept of God(s)? Or could it be more along the lines of human interpretation and institutions shaping our beliefs and practices along with the concept of worship?\n\nPlease understand that my intention is not to question anyone's faith or beliefs. I am genuinely curious, and since Reddit is a platform with diverse views and experiences, I thought this would be a good place to pose this question and maybe get some different perspectives. Looking forward to a respectful and enlightening discussion. Thank you!",

    "From as early as I can remember, abuse has been a constant companion in my life. I'm not writing this post to gather sympathy or pity but to raise awareness of the harsh realities many of us live each day and to maybe connect with individuals who have had similar experiences. \n\nMy parents were both drug addicts. Dad was physically abusive, while mom was more of the emotionally manipulative type who had a knack for making you feel like you're less than nothing. Countless times, I'd be woken up at 3 AM by the sounds of them arguing, often escalating into violence. This was my 'normal'.\n\nGrowing up, I skirted from friend's house to friend's house just to avoid being at home. But no matter how much I tried to escape it, the abuse seemed to follow me like a shadow. I found myself in relationships that mirrored the same toxic dynamics I had been running away from; I guess it was a familiar territory.\n\nThe emotional abuse was just as damaging, if not more, than the physical abuse. My mother, in her drug-induced haziness, could say the cruelest things. She excelled at making me question my self-worth, my ambition, my dreams, my everything. \n\nProfessional help was out of the question. My family didn't believe in psychotherapy, scoffed at the idea of mental health, and that's not even taking into account the financial implications.\n\nAs a society, we often tend to oversimplify abuse. You're just told to 'get out' or 'fight back'. But when you've known nothing else, when the abuse has been normalized in your life, it isn't that easy. It's like being stuck in a quicksand of trauma; the more you struggle, the more it pulls you under. \n\nIn desperation, I finally turned to support groups, online communities, reading material, anything that could help me understand my situation, deal with it, maybe even escape it. \n\nFinally opening up about my experiences and realizing that I am not alone, that there is help and a way out, has been part of my healing process. So, to anyone reading this who might be in a similar situation, know this: Your reality now is not your forever. You are not your abuse. There are communities, hotlines, organizations willing to help. Reach out. Don't silence your pain. And most importantly, believe in your strength to overcome.\n\nTo those who've read my story, thank you for lending an ear. It is deeply appreciated.",

    "I've been experimenting with fent pressies lately and figured I'd share today's experience. Even though it is often advised against due to its elevated risk to our health, today's session ended up being surprisingly enjoyable.\n\nI had a free afternoon and decided to spend some time alone, engaged in my love for experimenting with substances. My mate recently supplied me with some batch of fent pressies and I've been pretty eager to have a go. \n\nThroughout the process, I looked after my dose and made sure to keep it on the low side due to the infamous risks associated with fentanyl. The onset was gradual, leaving me wrapped in an unusual yet pleasant warmth. I lounged around in a state of pure tranquility, music softly playing in the background catering to the blissful aura. \n\nHaving understood the necessity for alertness and caution while indulging in substances like these, I previously equipped myself with Naloxone. I'd highly recommend everyone doing the same because safety should always be the foremost priority. \n\nIn terms of side effects, I stayed hydrated and maintained a light diet to combat any possibilities of nausea or dehydration. It’s important to really monitor your body and know your limits while using substances like these. \n\nAlthough today's experience turned out to be calming and enjoyable, I'd like to re-emphasise the importance of not promoting such practices, due to its potentially lethal implications. Substance abuse isn't something that needs to be glamorized. It’s a serious matter and everyone should proceed with extreme caution, if at all. \n\nStay safe folks! Peace out.",

    "I want to preface this by saying that I am a massive Hamilton fan. I've followed Lin-Manuel Miranda's career since In The Heights, I've been fortunate enough to see Hamilton live not once, but twice. I know every single word to every single song, it's that deep. Hamilton, to me, isn't just a piece of theatre, it's a piece of art that revolutionized the Broadway scene with its cross-genre music and diverse cast.\n\nNow, when it was announced that a filmed version of the stage production was going to be released on Disney+, I was ecstatic. I remember staying up until 3 AM, just to watch it as soon as it came out.\n\nBut the way the movie was executed left a lot to be desired.\n\nFirst off, there were an insane amount of close-ups. Yes, it allowed us to see the actor's expressions more clearly, but it also removed a lot of the broader stage context. What about the intricate choreography that occurs during the ensemble pieces, or the clever stage movements that we miss because we're focused on one person's face? \n\nI also noticed an excessive use of dramatic unnecessary camera angles, especially during \"Satisfied\" and \"The Room Where it Happens\". In my opinion, they detracted from the performers and their acting. On stage, lighting and blocking are used to guide the audience's attention, but in this film, it felt more like a music video than a Broadway show.\n\nAdditionally, the editing didn't seem to keep the rhythm of the music in mind - quick cuts during slower songs were jarring and upsetting the flow.  \n\nLastly, the sound mixing was off. I found it bizarre how sometimes, a character's voice was louder off-stage than the one singing right in front of the camera. \n\nOverall, what I adore about live theatre is partly the imperfections: the raw emotion, the small mishaps, the tangible energy. This film just felt a bit too polished, and sometimes, a certain nuance was lost in translation.\n\nIn no way am I saying that the Hamilton film is an absolute tragedy. The performances are still incredible and the storytelling is what we all fell in love with. But I would be lying if I didn't say I was a bit disappointed with how it turned out. I hope future Broadway-to-film adaptations learn from this. Maybe we could find a better way to translate the magic of stage to film without compromising on the essence.",
    "I've been seeing numerous comparisons being drawn between Alberius and Euden lately, and honestly, I believe we should put a stop to it. It concerns me that people are devaluing both characters this way, as they both have unique strengths, weaknesses and narrative arcs that deserve to be appreciated on their own merits. \n\nAlberius, for instance, is one of the first seven king's children and the founder of Alberia. His story is largely rooted in legacy, sacrifice, and kingdom building. He had to navigate his way through politics, war, and the responsibility of the royal bloodline. His legend affects the plot of the game on a grand scale, and his strong, charismatic, strategic, and stoic personality reflects these elements of his character.\n\nEuden, on the other hand, is a much more relatable character. He's the stereotypical hero who, despite being the seventh prince and often overlooked, has the potential for greatness. His story is more about personal growth, finding courage, building relationships, and proving his worth. He's friendly, optimistic, kind, and surprisingly humble for a prince.\n\nComparing these two characters is akin to comparing an apple to a mango - both are fruits, but they offer different tastes, nutrients, and culinary uses. Yes, Alberius and Euden are both princes, heirs to the throne, and central figures in the narrative. But their characteristics, behaviors, experiences, and contributions to the story are distinct and unique.\n\nInstead of focusing on drawing comparisons, let's appreciate what each character brings to the table. Every hero has their own story, and by attempting to compare them, we are not only simplifying their narratives, but also minimizing their individual impacts. Let's celebrate Alberius for being the founder, and Euden for being the potential hero he is. \n\nIn other words, let's stop comparing and start appreciating the characters for their own worth and contribution to the overall narrative of the game. They are different pieces of the same puzzle, and both serve essential roles in the rich tapestry of the story.",
    "Last night while I was in my backyard, I heard this weird sound which sounded eerily similar to human laughter. It only lasted for a few seconds, long enough to pique my curiosity. It wasn't a bird or other animal; it was too structured, almost rhythmic. I suspect it might have been an insect. My initial guess was a cicada or a cricket, but after looking up their sounds online, neither were a match.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this? Is there an insect known to make such sounds or am I just imagining things? I am located in South Carolina, USA, if that narrows down possible insect types. I have to admit, it was a bit creepy, sitting in the quiet evening only to hear what sounded like tiny laughter. I'd appreciate any insight on this. Thanks in advance!",
    "Taking on a bit of a unique project and wanted to pick the brains of everyone here. \n\nContext: I'm currently building a custom motorcycle and have found myself pondering the idea of utilizing oversized float bowls in place of a traditional gas tank. The idea popped up when I was considering ways to maintain the sleek look of the bike without a protruding gas tank. \n\nConcept: The plan is to have oversized float bowls integrated into the design of the bike on either side which each hold about half the fuel a traditional tank would. I found some large copper tubs that might be a perfect fit for this purpose and could add a nice aesthetic to the bike as well.\n\nDrawbacks: I understand that this strategy may lead to consistent refilling which I'm not overly concerned about as this is more of a showpiece than anything. However, I wonder if there might be other potential danger or damage possibilities? Could overflow be a problem? Would pressure build up become an issue? \n\nOther Technicalities: I'm also unsure how I would go about ensuring the bowls fill evenly. Is this even necessary? How would this affect the carburation process? \n\nWould love your input on these speculations and any other potential issues I may have overlooked. Suggestions on how to execute this or alternative solutions are also highly welcome.\n\nRemember, this is a fun, experimental and creative project so let's keep an open mind! \n\nThank you for sharing your expertise with me.",
    "I've been dating this guy for about six months now. When we first started dating, things were great. He was kind, generous, and wanted nothing but happiness for me. But recently, things have started to change.\n\nHe's begun displaying erratic behavior. One minute, he’s completely aloof and dismissive, and the next, he’s overly affectionate. The most unsettling change, however, is that he tries to force me to kiss him. Sometimes he does this in public, despite my evident discomfort. Furthermore, he’s started to become manipulative, turning things around to make it seem like I’m unreasonable when I pull away or don't respond to his advances the way he expects me to.\n\nI've tried discussing my concerns with him multiple times because communication is key, right? Each time, he insists that he loves me, but his actions show otherwise. His behavior has led me to question whether this is a means of control for him. Perhaps I'm overthinking, but his actions and the way he disregards my feelings are beginning to raise red flags for me. \n\nIs what I'm experiencing normal in a relationship? Are these just quirks I need to accept? Or am I right in suspecting this as a control mechanism? I'd appreciate hearing advice and opinions from those who may have gone through something similar or who can offer a third-party perspective. I'm at a loss for what to do.",
    "Hello everyone,\n\nI am reaching out to this community to share and gather insights concerning an issue that I've been wrestling with lately. I suffer from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of some difficult episodes from my past. I have been researching about alternative treatment methods for PTSD and have come across the usage of MDMA-assisted therapy. Many success stories have emerged about this form of therapy — people seemingly being able to confront and process their long-held traumas, which is truly inspiring and gives hope.\n\nHowever, there's a particular barrier that I'm finding really hard to navigate. One of my PTSD symptoms involves dissociating. When I'm stressed or when I'm attempting to confront my trauma, my mind seems to 'disconnect' from reality. I feel detached from my own body and the world around me, almost like I'm watching my life from a distance. This protective mental mechanism that my brain has developed tends to kick in and keeps me from fully engaging with my traumas, which I believe is necessary for me to truly heal.\n\nIt appears to me, from my research, that the success of MDMA therapy partly hinges on the ability of the person to fully dive into their traumatic experiences, confront them, feel them and finally process them. I worry that my dissociative episodes may limit this full engagement. I constantly have this fear that even if I pursue MDMA-assisted therapy, I might not be able to get its full benefits due to my own mind's protective measures.\n\nIsn't this ironic? My brain's protective measure, developed because of trauma, might be acting as a barrier to healing the very same trauma. \n\nI'm posting here to check if anyone has had a similar experience, and how they navigated through it. Can MDMA therapy work in conjunction with dissociation? Is there anything I can do beforehand to limit my dissociation during a session? Also, I would love to hear from mental health professionals about their take on this issue. I plan to seek guidance from my own therapist as well but having multiple perspectives can be very illuminative.\n\nThank you so much for hearing me out and I appreciate any advice or shared experiences you can offer. Please remember to respect each other and the guidelines of this subreddit.",
    "I've just gotta take a moment to commend the incredible storytelling skills and character development that's gone into making a character that I, along with a vast majority of the fandom, just absolutely loathe. \n\nEvery scene they're in is like a masterclass in making my blood boil. The disconnect between their actions and their justifications is so maddeningly wide, and yet, they're written so well that you can't help appreciate the type of character they are. It's all too easy to create a one-dimensional villain, but to have a character who is so convincingly flawed, so deeply infuriating but still complex, truly takes skilled writing. \n\nI have to tip my hat to how they've managed to balance distinctive character traits, compellingly abhorrent actions, and still maintain a sense of realness. Their presence creates a palpable tension; they truly affect the emotional atmosphere. \n\nEven though we despise them, we have to appreciate a character that incites such strong reactions, something that many narratives strive to achieve but often fall short of. It really is a testament to the quality of storytelling when we're so engaged, enough to feel a profound distaste for a character. \n\nNormally, you'd think hating a character is a bad thing, but in this case, it's a testament to the excellent writing and character development that makes us feel such intense emotions. Good job to the creators, you've made a character so easy to hate, we love to hate them.",

    "I just wanted to vent a bit about my current situation, and am looking for advice from anyone who was or is in a similar position. I love my brother dearly. He's been diagnosed with schizophrenia a couple of years ago and ever since, our family's life has been turned upside down. \n\nHe has symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, thought disorders, and erratic behavior. Especially when the delusions become severe, he develops a strong mistrust in everyone including us, his family. It's really straining to constantly try to reach out to him and help, only to be pushed away or even hurt.\n\nSome days are okay, and he seems to be doing relatively fine. Other days, it's a living hell – for him, and for us, as we stand by helplessly, not knowing how to pull him out of his downward spiral.\n\nMy parents and I have been doing everything in our power to support him, from getting him the best care possible to assisting with his daily tasks, medications etc. But it's so exhausting; physically, emotionally and mentally. I can't help but feel drained most days. It's like there's never a moment of respite.\n\nAside from the toll it's taken on my personal life and mental health, it has also affected the family dynamics a lot. We sometimes argue because of the stress, frustrations build up and the atmosphere can get unbearable.\n\nI write this post out of a place of deep emotional exhaustion.

    "It's becoming incredibly frustrating dealing with my managers at my retail job. It seems like every time they count the drawers at the end of the night and the amount doesn't add up correctly, they automatically suspect me or whoever was running the register of mishandling the cash.\n\nFor example, last night my manager came to me and claimed that the drawer was $20 short. I am extremely careful when making transactions, always double checking that I give the correct change and putting the cash in the appropriate slots. I even go as far as to repeat the amount of change I'm giving back to the customer for my own memory's sake. \n\nWhen I tried to defend myself, the manager just dismissed my concerns and implied that the fault lied with me. There weren't any repercussions for the supposed shortage, but to have them just automatically assume I made a mistake without considering they could've potentially miscounted themselves is really insulting.\n\nAnother possibility that no one seems to consider is customers scamming us or trying to confuse us during transactions to get more change back. I try to be alert for these situations, but it's not always easy to catch in the moment, especially when the store gets busy.\n\nMaybe I’m misunderstanding the way things works around here? I’ve only been here for 3 months, but I do have previous cashiering experience and such situations have rarely happened before. \n\nJust wanted to vent a little and see if anyone else has had similar experiences.

    "As an avid fan of the game, I've keenly watched the trailer of \"Security Breach\" several times, and something caught my eye in the last few seconds. Am I the only one who noticed a distinct, somewhat mysterious arm appearing at the very end of the trailer or has someone else spotted it too? \n\nThis arm seems to belong to a character not yet introduced. The sleeve has a particular color and design, suggesting it might not be a mere random bystander. Could this arm belong to a new character we haven't met yet? Or is it a hint at someone returning? \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts, theories, and assumptions about this. Anyone else as hooked and curious as I am? What's your take on this?",
    "Alright folks, let's clear the air here. It's brewing in my mind for a while, and now I feel it's the right time to spread it out.\n\nWe live in a society where \"Youth\" is glorified to such an extent that it feels like a separate world altogether. Don't get me wrong - Doing crazy stuff, chasing dreams, and doing things with more energy is all part of the fun and thrill. Yes, being young means having the energy and time to explore, learn, make mistakes, and grow. But it doesn't give you an upper hand on everything.\n\nMany assume that just by being young they hold some sort of prowess over those who are older, as if reaching a certain age diminishes your worth or capability, but that's just not true. Age might bring weariness and wrinkles, but it also brings wisdom, experiences, lessons, and perspectives - survival tools that you can't simply gain by virtue of being young.\n\nOlder folks have seen more days, more people, more worlds than us. They’ve been through life’s cycles enough times to know that nothing lasts – not their youth, not sorrow, not happiness. That makes them far richer than us in life.\n\nAlso, it's a common myth that you stop learning once you age. Learning is a lifelong process - your age, young or old, should not be a barrier to your drive to learn and grow. I’ve seen youngsters sticking to their mindsets and older folks willing to change their lifelong beliefs - it's all about the mindset, not the age.\n\nAnd then comes the most critical point: actually living. Living doesn't mean going to parties or going on adrenaline adventures. It's about living every experience - happiness, sadness, fear, exhilaration, boredom, routine - all of them. It's alright if your definition of living doesn't conform to what movies portray; everyone has their own way, and all ways are perfect.\n\nLet's quit buying into the myth that age discounts your ability to contribute or participate fully in life. It’s time we start respecting everyone’s journey and stop measuring worthiness through the lens of age. We all have our own pace, our own rhythm, and that should be respected, no matter if it's faster, slower or different from others.\n  \nTo sum it up, being young is a beautiful phase undoubtedly, but it doesn't give one a free pass or mean superior than anyone. Each phase has its own beauty and struggles. After all, a bottle of wine only gets better with",
    "“Elysium” is a thought-provoking and visually splendid foray into a dystopian future, rendered with the precise direction of Neill Blomkamp. Set in 2154, where the stark division between the rich and poor is painstakingly apparent and the socio-political subtext resonates loud and clear, the film keeps you riveted with its spectacular world-building.\n\nMatt Damon delivers a compelling performance as the desperate hero, Max, whose life hangs by a thread and is torn between saving himself or humanity at large. The distinctive physicality he brings to the role complements his natural charisma, making us root for him every step of the way.\n\nOn the other hand, Sharlto Copley's villainous Kruger is undeniably impactful. Copley, with his raw and sometimes chilling portrayal, provides a worthy adversary to Damon's Max. Their intense confrontations make for some of the film's most memorable moments.\n\nJodie Foster, in the role of the cold and calculating Secretary Delacourt, gives a performance that is classic Foster: measured, nuanced, and undeniably powerful. However, it is the film's visual effects that steal the show. From the sleek and clean utopian space station Elysium to the gritty and grim Earth, the imagery is nothing short of stunning.\n\nHowever, the movie does struggle with pacing and narrative efficiency. While the first half sets up an engrossing universe, the second half becomes somewhat cluttered, with plot threads not receiving the closure they deserve. \n\nThe social commentary presented here is potent, but its delivery often strays into the realm of heavy-handedness. At times, the screenplay tends to oversimplify the complex themes it wishes to navigate, which slightly undermines the film's overall impact.\n\nDespite these creases, \"Elysium\" remains a largely successful venture thanks to its captivating premise, strong performances, and spectacular visual effects. It is a bold commentary on class struggle and the distribution of wealth that will strike a chord with those receptive to its message, while also offering a visually arresting cinematic experience to casual viewers.",
    "\"Army of Darkness\" stands as a testament to both the genius and delightful madness of director Sam Raimi. Transitioning from the deep terror of the first two \"Evil Dead\" films, Army of Darkness serves as a humor-riddled, yet frightening, conclusion to the franchise, and does so with a style uniquely its own.\n\nBruce Campbell's return as the protagonist, Ash Williams, has become iconic for his scruffy perseverance, paired with his incredibly sarcastic and fearless attitude against the waves of evil he faces. Campbell shines in the role, presenting a star-quality blend of wit, sarcasm, horror, and badassery that's truly a cinematic delight.\n\nThe film's plot, set in the medieval era, is filled with tons of zany elements like talking skeletons, time-travel, and over-the-top blood spurts. It combines horror, comedy, and fantasy, creating an atmospheric contrast that somehow fits perfectly together thanks to Raimi's quirky sense of storytelling. \n\nWhat stands out is the movie's special effects, quite impressive for its time. The stop motion and practical effects bring an unusual charm while hearkening back to the silver age of film. The audio design, too, is superb, with chaotic clamors and eerie silence contributing equally to the movie's horror aspects.\n\n\"Army of Darkness\" revels in its absurdity and refuses to take itself too seriously, which could either make it a \"love it or hate it\" kind of film for viewers. Its tongue-in-cheek approach to horror is what gives it its charm and unique identity, setting it apart from the standard fare of its genre. \n\nOverall, \"Army of Darkness\" is packed with quotable lines, memorable scenes, and infectious humor. It's a wild and absurdly enjoyable ride, asserting itself as a jewel in the crown of cult cinema. While it may not be for everyone, those who enjoy eccentric, eccentric cinema will surely find it a humorous, thrilling, and downright entertaining experience.\n",
    "\"Grave of the Fireflies\" is an intense and immensely powerful cinematic masterpiece. This film, set in Japan during World War II, tells the tragic yet poignant story of two young siblings, Seita and Setsuko, as they struggle for survival against staggering odds. Despite its animation medium, this film presents a brutally honest and heart-wrenching portrayal that is at times almost too painful to watch.\n\nThe director, Isao Takahata, employs supreme mastery over the art of storytelling. The narrative doesn't stray into the minutiae of the war, but instead focuses on the personal journey of the two main characters - a choice that makes the impact of this film far more profound. The depiction of the harsh realities of war, the loss of innocence, and the human will to survive are crafted with acute sensitivity and utmost precision.\n\nUniquely, this film does not draw on bright, euphoric colors, like many other animations. Instead, its landscape and imagery are painted with a melancholic palette, reflecting the somber and devastating undertones of war. The exquisite visuals manage to encapsulate the beauty amidst the ruins and the innocence surviving within the chaos. Yet, it never strays far from its core narrative and continually brings back the focus to the heartbreaking journey of Seita and Setsuko.\n\nThe voice-over performances are equally commendable. The actors bring an overwhelming sense of honesty to their characters. We feel for Seita's struggle and admire his resilience, while Setsuko's innocence and vulnerability invoke our empathy.\n\nWhat sets \"Grave of the Fireflies\" apart is its ability to simultaneously depict the horrors of war and the enduring power of the human spirit. It does not aim for shock value through graphic depictions of conflict, but instead utilizes a deeply emotional narrative to impart an equally disturbing sense of dread and heartbreak.\n\n\"Grave of the Fireflies\" demands to be felt rather than just simply observed. It is a poignant reminder of the never-ending cycle of war and its tragic consequences on humanity. Brace yourself for this masterclass in filmmaking which is sure to leave you profoundly moved. Although the subject matter is devastating, Isao Takahata's enduring masterpiece uses its heartrending tale to create a priceless artifact for the ages. In conclusion, \"Grave of the Fireflies\" is not just an animation, it is a film of a lifetime.",
    "\"Saboteur\", directed by the brilliant Alfred Hitchcock, is a riveting journey through a deceptive world of espionage and false identity. Released in 1942, in midst of the adrenaline pumping Second World War, this film uses this global tension to its advantage by grafting a personal story onto an international crisis, a characteristic trademark of Hitchcock’s style.\n\nThe central character Barry Kane (Robert Cummings), wrongfully accused of sabotage, delivers a commendable performance as he struggles against authorities and spies to clear his name. His journey allows for an exploration of a variety of American locales, each presenting unique threats and allies. \n\nPriscilla Lane as Pat Martin is luminous, gracefully transitioning from a naive model to a strong ally for our protagonist. The chemistry between Lane and Cummings is palpable, adding a refreshing romantic subplot to the otherwise intense narrative.\n\nHitchcock's direction is as always, masterful. He has taken an ordinary man and a myriad of extraordinary situations and woven them into a captivating narrative. Keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, he makes excellent use of suspense and surprises. The Statue of Liberty climax is iconic, a testament to Hitchcock's genius.\n\nThe film, however, is not without fault. A somewhat sluggish pace in the first half might disengage some, and the narrative occasionally feels a bit disjointed. However, the strength in character development and the thrilling third act more than makes up for these minor drawbacks.\n\nThe film uses a noir style emphasizing paranoia, trust issues and deception, making it a perfect fit for the WWII era setting. Norman Lloyd as the cold, calculating ‘Fry’ delivers a chilling performance. The film also offers a complex examination of American values under threat during wartime, a relevant theme that resonates throughout Hitchcock's filmography.\n\nAll in all, \"Saboteur\" is an underrated gem in Hitchcock's oeuvre. His knack for suspense, enriched characters, innovative storytelling, and beautifully framed shots are all present in this film. It might not be his best, but it surely is a classic that deserves attention. \"Saboteur\" stands as a prime example of great filmmaking in the pre-CGI era.",
    "Amidst the realm of witty, delightful, and endearing teenage flicks, \"She's the Man\" manages to stand on its own as an exceptionally entertaining film. The script nods to a modernized William Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\", beautifully repackaging and relocating the 17th-century play in an American boarding school setting. Amanda Bynes, in the prime of her career, brilliantly embodies a strong, funny, and unique character that goes against societal constraints. Her portrayal of Viola/Sebastian reveals how fluid she could be as an actress, maneuvering between the binaries of male and female.\n\nDuke Orsino, played by Channing Tatum, is projected as the charming and sincere love interest. His talent as an actor translates remarkably into his role, making for enjoyable viewing. The ensemble cast of other characters, including David Cross as the eccentric headmaster and Julie Hagerty as the lovable mother, add to the film's comical dimension and entertainment quotient.\n\n\"She's the Man\" brings forth an exploration of identity, gender norms, and societal expectations. All this, while developing a humorous and engaging narrative, which is a commendable feat. The film breaks the ground of stereotypical high school movies and delivers an experience that keeps viewers hooked.\n\nAll elements combined, from the enticing acting performances to the great scripting and directing, contribute to the magic of \"She's the Man\". Moreover, there is a subtle yet effective handling of important themes that might invoke thought in the audience. The movie is filled with humorous confusion, teenage drama, exquisite characters, and turns that keep you at the edge of your seat. In conclusion, \"She's the Man\" is more than worth your time, and definitely a film to add to your ‘must-watch’ list. It is a true gem, combining comedy, romance, and thought-provoking nuances.",
    "\"Batman Returns,\" the second entry in Tim Burton's stellar rendition of the iconic bat vigilante, continues to amaze even decades after its release. Returning to his intensely atmospheric representation of Gotham City, Burton successfully encapsulates the grim ambiance and impending doom that looms over a city driven by crime, corruption, and chaos.\n\nMichael Keaton reprises his role as Batman with a mesmerizing performance that perfectly blends the character's brooding nature with his commitment to justice. His portrayal of the dual characters - the Silicon Valley billionaire Bruce Wayne and the bat-themed vigilante Batman is nothing short of perfect. He clearly distinguishes between the laid-back facade of Wayne and the intense persona of Batman, adding deep layers to these characters.\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer's stunning interpretation of Catwoman is also praiseworthy. Her performance adds dimension to the complex character and keeps the audience captivated every moment she is on screen. Danny DeVito as the Penguin is equally powerful, delivering a touchingly manipulative and sinister performance that feels straight out of a nightmare.\n\nBurton's signature dark, Gothic aesthetics suit \"Batman Returns\" perfectly. The drenched streets, gargoyles perched on towering buildings, and the eeriness of the snow-covered city during Christmas amplify the sinister setting. Burton’s meticulous art direction and the striking cinematography seamlessly engulf viewers into his version of Gotham City.\n\nThe movie's elaborate set pieces, notably the Penguin's lair and the hauntingly beautiful Shreck’s Department Store, contribute significantly towards establishing the eerie atmosphere. The effective background score composed by Danny Elfman further appears to be an additional character in the film, heightening its emotional intensity.\n\n\"Batman Returns\" does exhibit some grievances. The plot sometimes treads into convoluted territory, and Burton's dark interpretation may not be everyone's cup of tea. However, the film's elements meld together wonderfully, ensuring its cult classic status. It does justice to Batman's core sociopolitical themes, edgy noir-tones, and an incredibly engaging narrative.\n\nIn closing, \"Batman Returns\" is not just another superhero movie - it's an art. The film amalgamates genres, seamlessly blending action, drama, romance, and horror into one, pioneering an entirely new paradigm in the superhero genre. This may not be a Batman that everyone agrees with, but it is certainly one of the most intriguing visualizations of the iconic character that demands to be seen.",
    "\"Rang De Basanti\" is a brilliantly crafted socio-political drama that is a must-watch for cinema enthusiasts worldwide. Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra skillfully merges contemporary India with its rich history, using six students as the linchpin for the narrative. The movie deftly portrays the transition of these carefree students into responsible individuals, galvanized into action by certain unforeseen circumstances.\n\nThe dexterity with which Mehra interweaves two different timelines is commendable, as is his adaptation of historical characters in a contemporary framework. The screenplay by Kamlesh Pandey is power-packed and emotional, leaving the audience hooked from beginning to end.\n\nThe ensemble cast featuring Aamir Khan, Siddharth, Kunal Kapoor, Sharman Joshi, Soha Ali Khan, and Atul Kulkarni, deliver power-packed performances. Aamir Khan stands out with one of the most memorable performances of his career. Not only do the characters feel real and relatable, but their transformation is also credible and thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nThe soundtrack by A.R Rahman serves as the backbone of the movie. His music resonates with the storyline and the emotions of the characters. Whether it's the rebellious \"Khalbali,” the patriotic \"Luka Chuppi,\" or the stirring \"Roobaroo,\" each track blends seamlessly into the narrative.\n\nThe cinematography is exceptional with India’s beauty captured in all its glory; it works in perfect harmony with the brilliant direction. The film also excels in other technical aspects including editing and production design.\n\n\"Rang De Basanti\" is not just a film but a notable commentary on Indian society, politics, and the youth's role in its progression. Interestingly, it also mirrors a sense of urgency and desire for change. It is an emotionally stirring, inspiring, and aesthetically pleasing cinematic experience that prompts introspection.\n\nAlthough set in India and dealing with distinct Indian issues, \"Rang De Basanti\" is a universal story that resonates with audiences globally. Its narrative is relevant for any society grappling with political and social issues. Undoubtedly, it remains one of the finest examples of Indian cinematic prowess and is well-deserving of all its acclaim.",
    "\"Inside Out\" is not just another animated feature. It is a groundbreaking film masterfully created by Pixar that genuinely speaks to both children and adults on an emotional level. The compelling storyline revolves around five emotions living inside the mind of an 11-year-old girl, Riley. The characters Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger all have unique personal qualities that effortlessly contribute to the depth and braveness of the plot.\n\nVisually, \"Inside Out\" is stunning. Pixar once again raises the bar with its creative and brightly colored depictions of Riley's inner world. The setting is imaginative and contributes significantly to the overall narrative; from the labyrinth-like long-term memory bank to the depiction of abstract thought and the subconscious, the level of detail is astounding.\n\nWhat truly sets \"Inside Out\" apart from other animated films is the psychological depth provided to its characters. Each emotion essentially plays a vital role, thereby expelling the cliché that happiness is paramount. It remarkably illustrates the complexity of human feelings, and how these interplaying emotions contribute to our personalities and how we perceive the world. This movie delicately balances fun and heart-tugging emotions, holding a mirror to our lives without being overwhelmingly sentimental.\n\nIn terms of the performances, the voice-over actors did a phenomenal job. Amy Poehler as Joy and Phyllis Smith as Sadness particularly stand out, infusing their characters with warmth, humor, and an astonishing amount of depth. The script is sharp, witty, and filled with memorable one-liners.\n\n\"Inside Out\" is more than just an animated film. It is an entertaining, humorous, and profoundly touching exploration of human emotions. It underlines the fact that there is no pure joy without sadness, and it's okay to feel both. This movie is a cinematic triumph, a great testament to Pixar's ingenuity, and a profound cinematic experience that crosses the generation gap. A must-watch for movie lovers of all ages.",
    "\"The Color of Money\" is a compelling take on the world of pool hustling, fueled by gripping performances and masterful direction. Martin Scorsese showcases his adept skills behind the camera in this sequel to \"The Hustler,\" drawing out the complexities and tensions of the dimly lit pool halls and the seedy underbelly of the game.\n\nPaul Newman, reprising his role as the old pro \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, brings a weathered depth to his character that is both raw and convincing. His quest to rejuvenate his career takes us on a journey of ambition, legacy, and redemption. Newman's Academy Award-winning performance argues that a man's prime doesn't necessarily end after his youth does. \n\nHis interaction with Tom Cruise, who plays the flashy and cocky protege Vincent, sparks the narrative into an intense emotional whirlpool. Cruise's natural charisma serves his character well, but it's his underplayed vulnerability that impresses more, showing us early signs of the depth he would bring into later dramatic roles.\n\nThere are, however, sections where the narrative seems to wander, abruptly changing lines of thought. But such issues are easily eclipsed by the brilliant character writing and the pulsating pool scenes. The use of music effectively enhances the mood, with songs adding another layer to the drama unfolding.\n\nSpecial mention goes to the cinematography, that transforms pool into a ballet of sorts, playing the dark shadows of the bars and bright lights reflecting off the pool balls into a visual extravaganza. Scorsese's apt direction and the commendably detailed production design beautifully capture the grungy allure of pool halls and bars, portraying an entire subculture with respect and authenticity.\n\nOverall, \"The Color of Money\" intelligently explores the psyche of a pool hustler, examining themes of ego, greed, and victory at the cost of personal ethics. It is a well-crafted cinematic drama set against the backdrop of the green-felted pool tables, engaging you right up to its thoughtful climax.",

The special effects are spectacular, particularly during the spacewalk and propulsion scenes. They amplify the daunting vastness and hostile beauty of outer space, making \"Passengers\" a captivating visual treat.\n\nThomas Newman's soaring score is another standout element. It perfectly complements the narrative’s tension and desperation, creating a perfect atmosphere for the moviegoers to immerse themselves.\n\nHowever, the film is not without its controversies. Some may find the plot's primary ethical dilemma disturbing and argue that it lacks depth in dealing with the morally complex situation it presents. Moreover, the ending may feel rushed to some, considering the film's massive build-up of suspense and exploration of existential despair. \n\nDespite these, \"Passengers\" is a compelling watch for fans of the sci-fi genre, living up to the promise of a visually enthralling space drama with charismatic leads. It serves up a unique blend of suspenseful survival story with a romantic angle, maintaining the audience’s attention from start to finish.

    "\"30 Days of Night\" proves to be an impressive advancement in the vampire genre, cultivating a sense of chilliness that is both literal and figurical. With its compelling premise, the film creates an eerie and foreboding setting that works remarkably in its favor.\n\nIn the icy cold town of Barrow, Alaska, the movie thrives on its unique selling point - a whole month of uninterrupted nightfall, an ideal feeding ground for vampires. This atmospheric backdrop not only accentuates the terror, but also skillfully brings out the isolation and helplessness of the characters.\n\nThe relatively unknown cast delivers a commendable performance. Josh Hartnett's portrayal of Eben Oleson is impressively nuanced, and his dynamic with Melissa George (Stella Oleson) is both believable and compelling.\n\nThe film keeps the audience on the edge of their seat with its riveting action. The relentless vampires are unnerving and brutal, and their takeover of the town is an intense watch. Moreover, the dark, grainy cinematography is successful in amplifying the tension.\n\nWhat truly carries this film, however, is the fascinating blend of horror and drama. The movie does not rely solely on jump scares but delves into its characters, their relationships, and their struggle for survival in these inhumane conditions.\n\nOn the downside, the film does fall into occasional genre clichés and could have done more with its interesting concept. Some key characters could have been given more development.\n\nWhether you're a fan of vampire lore or not, \"30 Days of Night\" integrates chilling scares alongside a certain depth, with its narrative twists. This film grabs onto an innovative and frightening concept then bites down hard.

The film's color palette, filled with warm hues and soft lights, creates a cozy, retro-futuristic atmosphere that adeptly mirrors Theodore's teetering emotional state. The film's cinematography is thoughtful and intimate, capturing close-ups that reveal the complexity of human emotion.\n\nThe central theme of \"Her\" is the intertwining of technology and human emotion. Jonze intriguingly uses the relationship between Theodore and Samantha, an intelligent operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson, to probe for answers to intriguing philosophical questions: Can artificial intelligence truly understand and express emotions? What makes human connection and relationships authentic?\n\nScarlett Johansson's performance deserves immense recognition. Even though she only exists as a voice, she convinces us of Samantha's increasingly complex emotions and consciousness. This successful delivery of emotion, despite the physical absence of an actor, is a testament to both Johansson's talent and Jonze's unique vision.\n\n\"Her\" is also a commentary on our society's increasing dependency on technology. It forces us to consider whether this reliance brings us closer together or pushes us further apart within our human relationships.\n\nAlthough the movie’s take on technology and love may be unconventional, it's told with such depth and sincerity that it's hard not to be moved. \"Her\" is a deeply contemplative, visually stunning masterpiece – an immersive journey into the human heart's resilience and capacity for love, regardless of circumstances. It's more than a movie; it's a captivating philosophical exploration that will leave you reflecting on the nature of relationships and the future implications of artificial intelligence in our lives.",

His performance perfectly captures the tortured genius who struggled with his internal demons while managing to revolutionize both the aviation and film industry. \n\nCate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn delivers an impeccable performance, buying into her role with disproportionate gusto. A special mention goes to John C. Reilly and Alec Baldwin who make their mark despite their limited screen time. \n\nThe story magnificently illustrates Hughes's ambitious endeavors and his ruthless pursuit of perfection. The film’s recreation of the Hollywood Golden Age is so remarkable that the viewers are thrown back in time, submerged wholly in that glammed up era of glitz and glories.\n\nScorsese does an exceptional job at portraying the quieter, intimate moments as powerfully as the grandiose spectacle, notably the striking depiction of Hughes's struggle with mental illness. The film successfully intertwines the worlds of business, politics, cinema, and aviation, showing the interconnected mesh that it was. \n\nThe film scores high on its technical aspects.

With the two princess sisters, Elsa and Anna at the heart of its narrative, the movie beautifully explores the theme of love, fear, acceptance and the complex dynamics of sisterhood.\n\nWhere other princess tales focus predominantly on the romantic affection between a prince and a princess, Frozen ingeniously deviates from this formulaic narrative by showcasing the love between two sisters. Elsa's journey from a fearful, isolated figure to a self-accepting, powerful woman is beautifully contrasted with Anna's ferocious loyalty and unwavering hope, offering an inspiring message for younger viewers. The bond between the sisters acts as the movie's emotional core, with their relationship's evolution throughout the film being genuinely touching and relatable.\n\nThe animation is stellar, bringing the frost-covered kingdom of Arendelle to life in a riot of spectacular colours and detailed artistry.

In particular, Menzel's phenomenal voice acting during the Oscar-winning song 'Let it go' is a testament to her abilities, etching a permanent mark in the annals of animated musicals.\n\nThe music deserves special mention.

The action sequences are well-choreographed and visually stunning, drawing you into Spider-Man's world.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" is its integration with the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The narrative is once again driven by the brilliance of Galifianakis’ comic style, shaping Alan's outrageous personality.\n\nStylistically, director Todd Philipp's approach is much more serious and he shifts the focus from hungover pieces of a party night to a full-on heist-crime comedy caper. Yet, he maintains ample elements of slapstick humor reminiscent of its predecessors, complementing the seriousness with comic relief.\n\nThe film dives deeper into their personal affinities and conflicts, which is a refreshing change from the usual raucous nature of the franchise. Amid all the chaos and laughs, the emotional dilemma of these characters is touchingly presented, adding a heartening depth to the narrative.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the film somewhat lacks the spark of the original film. It's certainly not loaded with belly laughs like the first two, but the film proves itself by not being a mere franchise project exploiting the success of the original, presenting a different perspective instead.\n\nThe performances as always are commendable - Galifianakis is stellar with his well-charted character arc, while Cooper and Helms keep up the level.\n\nDespite the plot holes, the movie is visually stunning, offering notable bird's-eye view shots of Las Vegas, and the soundtrack is wonderfully curated too.\n\nWhile “The Hangover Part III” misses the mark on its usual comedy, it does satisfy on account of its balanced character dynamics and well-played dramatic tension. It catered more to plot development and the characters’ evolution, a feat which most comedies rarely venture into.\n\nFans of the franchise might not be entirely pleased as it scrapes off its original formula to stand out as a different version of itself. But as a standalone, the film is entertaining, introspective, and worth a watch.",

As for the plot, even though it starts a bit slow, the mystery surrounding the Wendol and their identity keeps the viewers intrigued till the end. \n\nThe film explores themes such as bravery, honor, and camaraderie in an engaging way. While \"The 13th Warrior\" may not be a perfectly accurate historical representation, it offers a visually exciting and engaging story that keeps with the spirit of the historical fiction genre.\n\nSome may argue that the film falls into the trap of clichéd characters or predictable storylines. However, the way it packs history, legend, suspense, and action into a single film while drawing the viewer into its rich world certainly makes it worth a watch. \n\nThough \"The 13th Warrior\" may not be everyone's cup of tea considering its gritty, dark and sometimes violent nature, those looking for a riveting journey through a world of ancient lore brought to life might find it immensely enjoyable. This certainly qualifies as a purely entertaining cinematic ride.",
    "\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\" takes the concept of a conventional rom-com storyline and infuses it with tongue-in-cheek comedy, retro video game culture, and an indie rock soundtrack that truly sets it apart. Edgar Wright’s direction is a breath of fresh air, employing numerous innovative visual techniques and narrative devices that are almost comic in their execution but never fail to be engaging.\n\nMichael Cera assumes the role of Scott Pilgrim, a bass-guitarist who falls for Ramona Flowers, played by the enigmatic Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Cera charms the audience with his characteristic awkwardness, naivety, and inoffensive charm, while Winstead brings a mysterious draw to her character that enhances the plot. The on-screen chemistry between the two is captivating, providing many humorous and heartfelt moments as Scott must defeat Ramona's seven evil exes to win her heart.\n\nThe cast, including Kieran Culkin, Ellen Wong, and Anna Kendrick, deliver performances that are comically over-the-top yet fully endearing. The real stars, though, are the villains of the movie, each characterized with unique quirks that make their faceoffs with Scott memorable, particularly those with Chris Evans and Brandon Routh, who both deliver standout performances.\n\nThe film’s use of video game culture, with its battles presented similar to that of boss fights, including health bars and rewarding “coins” post-victory, is a creative ode to classic video games that will sincerely appeal to gaming aficionados. Additionally, the soundtrack adds another layer of enjoyment to the movie, with its catchy track-list helping to mold memorable moments and progress the story in a dynamic way.\n\nDespite its seemingly straightforward plot, \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\" often dares to dive into sincerely deep commentary about relationships, maturity, and personal growth. The movie becomes an allegory of overcoming the baggage from our significant others' pasts in a way that's relatable yet humorously absurd. It’s this balance that turns the movie from what could have been generic into a truly one-of-a-kind experience.\n\nWhile \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\" won't appeal to everyone due to its unique blend of comedy and thematic material, it is certainly worth a watch for its bold storytelling, fantastic visuals, and memorable characters. With its innovative blend of retro video game aesthetics, comic book storytelling, and indie rock flavor, it’s more than just a movie, it's an experience. A quirky, humorous, and at times emotional journey that truly hits a high score.",
    "\"Clash of the Titans\" artfully blends elements of Greek mythology with modern cinematic aesthetics, creating an experience that is both visually stunning and narratively captivating. The attention to detail in every scene, from the depiction of mythical creatures to the grandeur of the ancient Greek cityscapes, keeps the viewer fully immersed in the world of the Titans.\n\nThe star-studded cast, including Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, and Ralph Fiennes, truly embody their characters, delivering exceptional performances that only enhance the film's absorbing narrative. Worthington's portrayal of Perseus is particularly noteworthy, showcasing an admirable blend of heroic resilience and human vulnerability.\n\nThe film's crowning glory, however, is arguably its stunning visual effects. The epic battles between Gods and mythical beasts are breathtaking spectacles that complement the story rather than overpowering it. The use of CGI is balanced and thoughtful, adding depth and scale to the film without becoming overwhelming or unrealistic.\n\nOne aspect of \"Clash of the Titans\" that may not appeal to everyone is its adaptation of Greek mythology. The film takes many creative liberties with the source material, crafting a new interpretation rather than staying rigidly true to the ancient myths. However, in doing so, it crafts a unique narrative that is engaging in its own right, even if it may not satisfy purists.\n\nDespite its small shortcomings, \"Clash of the Titans\" stands out as a visually impressive and gripping fantasy adventure. This movie beautifully marries the thrill of big-budget Hollywood action with the intrigue and depth of Greek mythology. It's an epic tale of heroes, gods, and monsters that is not to be missed.",
    "\"Captain Phillips\", directed by Paul Greengrass, is a tense film inspired by the true-life event of Somali pirates hijacking a US MV Maersk Alabama in 2009. Tom Hanks, as the eponymous Captain Phillips, once again showcases his acting prowess with an astoundingly all-immersive performance, bringing an incredible depth of emotional authenticity to the character.\n\nThe film crafts an unerring sense of tension right from the beginning and carries it through till the very end. The splendid use of handheld camera enhances the feel of uncertainty, portraying the dire predicament of being trapped in the vast, unpredictable sea. Rather than a splashy, guns-blazing Hollywood spectacle, \"Captain Phillips\" is a minimalist and realistic thriller, establishing the confines of a lifeboat as effectively terrifying.\n\nThe portrayal of Somali pirates evoked a sense of pathos. Barkhad Abdi, as the pirate leader Muse, was particularly impressive in his portrayal of a desperate man with nothing to lose. The film, while grounded in intensity, ensures to humanize its villains, avoiding one-dimensionality.\n\nIts riveting narrative manages to convey themes of globalization quite subtly. In the captivating dialogue exchanges between Hanks and Abdi's characters, one can trace the echoes of poverty, desperation, and the stark economic disparities that underline the central conflict. They are not just protagonists and antagonists but also representatives of the world's imbalanced power structures.\n\nThe climax, featuring a breathtaking performance from an emotionally ravaged Hanks, packs a solid punch and reminds us why he is one of the finest actors of this generation. However, the resolution felt a bit rushed as compared to the nit grit of the rest, but this does not take away much from the overall appeal of the film.\n\n\"Captain Phillips\" is one of those rare thrillers that combine heart-pounding tension with underlining social commentary, masterfully delivered by Greengrass and his cast. It's well worth a watch for those appreciative of thrillers with both intellectual and emotional depth.",
    "\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" is an epic beginning to what promises to be a legendary trilogy. Mirroring the splendour of Tolkien's vision, Peter Jackson has yet again managed to so elegantly bring to life the magical realm of Middle Earth, this time from the gaze and the pace of a hobbit.\n\nThere's an incredible depth to \"An Unexpected Journey\", starting with its setting. From the quaint and quirky Hobbiton to the ethereal Rivendell Elven realm, the film has successfully captured the distinctive essence of each location. The cinematography consistently enhances the film's narrative; it’s extraordinary, providing luscious backdrops that immerse the viewer completely in the world of Middle Earth.\n\nThe casting is superb, with Martin Freeman starring as the doubting, reserved, yet undeniably courageous Bilbo Baggins. Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield provides a stern aura, equally powerful and layered as a character. Then there’s the resumption of Ian McKellan as Gandalf the Grey, a thoroughly delightful performance that reminds us why McKellan was so perfect in the role of Middle Earth's most beloved wizard in the first place.\n\nThe action sequences are fast-paced, well-choreographed and thrilling, rekindling the excitement of the \"The Lord of The Rings\" series. The fight in Goblin Town and the running escape from the bloodthirsty Wargs are tornadoes of frenzied action, thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nGranted, the first half does seem a bit slow. But the build-up of Bilbo's quiet, mundane hobbit life and subsequent 'unconventional' disruption by the dwarves offer an interesting mix of humour, camaraderie, and suspense.\n\nHoward Shore’s score is also worth mentioning. His compositions act as an individual character, driving our emotions and perfectly encapsulating the ambiance. Remember to sit back and listen - let the music contribute to the storytelling as much as the dialogue and the visuals.\n\nAll in all, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is a sublime revisit to the enchanting realm of Middle Earth. It continues the tradition of offering a sensory-overload of majestic scapes, a bolstering musical score, richly developed characters, and a story that is as unpredictable as it is exciting. And most importantly, it once again reminds us why fantasy is such a necessary escape from our mundane reality.",
    "\"Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind\" is an exemplary testament to the storytelling prowess of Studio Ghibli and the brilliant mind of Hayao Miyazaki. This 1984 masterpiece seamlessly combines elements of science fiction, fantasy, and post-apocalyptic themes into a hauntingly beautiful universe that serves as the backdrop for its thought-evoking narrative.\n\nAdorned in her signature blue tunic, the selfless and compassionate Princess Nausicaä sets a new benchmark for strong, female lead characters. She is a beacon of hope in a dying world, tirelessly striving for coexistence between humanity and nature. Beyond her remarkable character, the array of supporting characters are all well-detailed, each carrying their own motives and aspirations, fueling the complex dynamics of a world at the brink of total devastation.\n\nThe artwork, albeit slightly aged in comparison to more recent Studio Ghibli offerings, remains true to Miyazaki's signature style; it's strikingly beautiful and justly portrays the vast, dystopian universe. The giant ominous insects and the tranquil Toxic Jungle presentation deserve special mention for their detail, uniqueness, and relevance to the narrative.\n\nHowever, what truly stands out is the movie's powerful environmental message, which resonates even more strongly today than when the film was first released. Miyazaki’s conceptualization of a post-apocalyptic world devastated by humans, where nature retaliates, presents a stark warning about the consequences of environmental neglect.\n\nThe movie's ethereal soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi complements this narrative perfectly. Its hauntingly enchanting melodies intensify the viewer's emotional connection with the characters and their struggles.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind\" is more than an animated movie; it's a compelling message about environmental preservation wrapped in a fantastical steampunk universe. It demands to be watched, discussed, and cherished. It remains a timeless classic, truly symbolising the magic of Studio Ghibli and the genius mind of Hayao Miyazaki.",
    "\"Slumdog Millionaire\", directed by the visionary Danny Boyle and co-directed by Loveleen Tandan, capitalizes on a synthesis of breathtaking aesthetics and emotional substance to weave an enchanting tale of love, luck, and destiny in a seemingly rotten world. \n\nSet in the bustling arteries of Mumbai, this movie is a life-affirming journey of a young boy's perseverance against insurmountable odds.

Rahman, is an unforgettable, sensory overload that takes you on an unpredictable rollercoaster ride of emotions.

It has a universal appeal that will move any audience with its indelible storytelling. A true achievement in the world of cinema, \"Slumdog Millionaire\" is a film you can't afford to miss.",
    "\"The Avengers\" is a cinematic lockdown that delivers mind-blowing and jaw-dropping action sequences rapidly, without a pause for breath. The film combines the superhero universe convincingly by turning Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye into an ensemble force, rather than clashing individual entities. Enhanced by a witty script, it depicts each character with depth whilst maintaining the attention of the audience. Special effects, as expected, are of top-notch quality, creating a visually tantalizing experience.\n\nThe direction by Joss Whedon is incredibly impressive as he successfully amalgamates various story threads into a single unified plot, ensuring that each character has a significant part to play in the narrative. Pivotal confrontations and interactions are superbly handled, resulting in numerous memorable moments.\n\nThe performances in the movie are equally commendable. Robert Downey Jr.'s charm as Tony Stark is infectious, and Chris Evans’ constant display of honor and righteousness as Captain America perfectly aligns with his character. Mark Ruffalo makes a great Hulk— both terrifying and sympathetic, while Chris Hemsworth as Thor brings about the necessary spatial-related seriousness. On the other hand, Scarlett Johansson shines bright as the formidable Black Widow and Jeremy Renner is serviceable as Hawkeye.\n\nThe movie is not all action and no story. The essence of courage, sacrifice, and unity amid chaos is well embodied within the film. It is an eye-popping spectacle that deftly integrates humor, emotional nuances, and rollicking adventure. The charisma of the characters in combination with the engaging plot makes \"The Avengers\" a standout among superhero films. This movie doesn't just meet the hype, it surpasses it, giving fans exactly what they would want from a comic book brought to life. Strongly recommended if you are up for top-quality blockbuster entertainment.",
    "\"Limitless\" is an exhilarating rollercoaster ride through the mind of a man who has discovered the key to reach his full intellectual potential. Bradley Cooper gives an engaging performance as Eddie Morra, a struggling writer who transforms into a financial wizard after consuming a mystical pill. This film explores an intriguing concept - What would you do if you could use 100% of your brain?\n\nThe gripping storyline is filled with twists and turns, ensuring that viewers are hooked from the start until the very end. Neil Burger's direction truly adds depth to the plot, visually illustrating the drastic contrast between Eddie's life before and after his introduction to the mind-enhancing drug. The intense pace of the movie perfectly complements the spiralling life of the protagonist as he delves deeper into the new realms of his cognition.\n\nThe movie's cinematography offers a vivid depiction of New York city, enhancing the vibrant changes in Eddie's life thanks to the mysterious pill. The use of trance-inducing visual effects to show the expansion of his cognition creates a surreal and immersive experience for the audience.\n\nBradley Cooper's consistent performance throughout the movie effectively portrays his transformation from a struggling writer to a successful magnate. His initial portrayal of a hopeless man and his evolution speaks volumes of his range as an actor. The chemistry between Cooper and Robert De Niro, who plays a skeptical business tycoon, is palpable and makes for a compelling viewing.\n\nDespite its intriguing plot, \"Limitless\" doesn't shy away from dissecting the ethical implications of mind-enhancing drugs, adding an extra layer to the beautiful tapestry of its story. \n\nIn conclusion, \"Limitless\" is a gripping thriller that combines the allure of an eccentric fantasy with the drama of everyday struggle. Its stunning visuals, engrossing storyline, and stellar performances make it a must-watch for those seeking a thrilling, thought-provoking cinematic experience.",
    "\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" continues the larger-than-life tale of Captain Jack Sparrow and his eccentric, adventuresome crew.

The plot remains engaging and complex, never shying away from delving deep into its own mythos. Twists, turns and action-packed sequences keep you at the edge of your seat, with Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow being the vibrant heart of the story. His mix of flamboyant charm and knack for chaotic situations is as entertaining as ever and perfectly captures the tone of the series.\n\nThe supporting cast also shines brightly. Orlando Bloom as Will Turner and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann effectively provide the emotional core of the movie. Their characters have grown significantly over the course of the series, with Knightley proving to be a surprisingly adept action heroine. Bill Nighy’s portrayal of Davy Jones continues to impress. His eerie portrayal of the tentacled villain is convincingly menacing, adding another dimension to the brand of villains in the franchise.\n\nVisually, \"At World's End\" is a treat; the cinematography is marvellous, demonstrating some of the best visual effects the series has to offer. The soundtrack, as always, is an integral part of the movie atmosphere. The epic score complements every scene, adding depth and emotion to the narrative flow.\n\nHowever, at almost three hours, the film's runtime feels a bit excessive and could have benefited from tighter editing. Some plotlines also require close attention, otherwise it's easy to get lost.

    "The film \"Gone with the Wind\" stands as an unparalleled cinematic classic. Few films can claim the same level of sweeping grandeur, captivating performances, and timeless storytelling that this masterpiece delivers. Adapted from the novel by Margaret Mitchell, and directed by Victor Fleming, the film takes one on a titanic journey through the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era.\n\nVivien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett O'Hara – the sharp-tongued, strong-willed and highly manipulative Southern belle – is nothing short of inspiring and heart-wrenching. The manner in which she encapsulates not only Scarlett's determined character, but her internal fragility that underlies her apparent ruthlessness, is testimony to Leigh's acting prowess. On the other hand, Clark Gable's Rhett Butler is the perfect foil - ruggedly handsome, irresistibly charming, and convincingly cynical. Together, they are an enchanting pair, sparking one of the most dramatic love stories seen onscreen.\n\nThe film's scope is truly article ignoring neither the grandeur nor the bleaker aspects of the Civil War period. The burning of Atlanta and Scarlett's desperate escape through the chaos is a visual spectacle that still holds up today. The detailed period-accurate costumes and settings add layers to the already dense narrative. \n\nWithout forgetting Hattie McDaniel's groundbreaking performance as Mammy - making her the first African American to win an Academy Award. Her character serves as the moral compass, providing depth, and commentary on the racial dynamics of the time.\n\nHowever, the film's depiction of slavery and African-American characters have rightly come under scrutiny. While laudable in its grandeur and drama, it glosses over and glamorizes the harsh realities of slavery, which rightly makes modern audiences uncomfortable and compels us to rethink an uncritical celebration of the movie.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Gone with the Wind\" is both a monumental landmark in film history and a genuinely engrossing story. It's a testament to love, war, and survival that has brought to the forefront both film making splendor as well as significant conversations about the history it represents.",
    "\"Justice League\" is a high-definition spectacle in the realm of superhero movies, delivering an action-packed and entertaining adventure that will satisfy both casual and diehard comic book fanatics. The stellar ensemble cast, which includes Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Henry Cavill, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller and Ray Fisher, proves to be its greatest asset, as they bring their respected characters to life with perfect superhero charisma, uniquely capturing the essence of their characters from the comic book lore. \n\nFrom the visual effects standpoint, \"Justice League\" exhibits a cinematic grandeur. The battle scenes are an astonishing sight to behold, pairing amazing choreographies with beautiful cinematography that provides an epic and immersive viewing experience. The twist on the superhuman abilities of each character is depicted in a uniquely enthralling style, highlighting the movie’s innovative envisioning of the comic book universe.\n\nHowever, despite these positives, \"Justice League\" struggles with evenly distributing its comprehensive story arcs and fleshing out the complex personalities of its characters. With an overstuffed plot and an overwhelming amount of characters, the screenplay often feels rushed, leaving little room for character growth or profundity. The villain, Steppenwolf is disappointingly underdeveloped, and becomes a weak adversary, lacking the complexity and depth usually associated with DC villains.\n\nMoreover, the movie's disjointed tone, shifting between darkness and humor, can come across as unsettling, and seems to be a result of the different creative inputs by directors Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon.\n\nNonetheless, the film’s pace is consistently energetic, full of thrilling face-offs and grueling battles which form the backbone of the narrative. The interactions among the League members are filled with humorous banter that offers light-hearted moments and keeps the audiences engaged.\n\nAll in all, \"Justice League\" succeeds in offering an entertaining superhero ride filled with eye-catching visuals and a dazzling roster of DC heroes, despite its narrative shortcomings and tonal inconsistency. It definitely sets the stage for future DC ventures and will leave audiences impatiently waiting for the next chapter.",
    "\"12 Angry Men\" is a timeless masterpiece that refuses to fade into obscurity. More than just a simple courtroom drama, it is an intense exploration of human character and a penetrating, often uncomfortable look at the American system of justice. The movie is a riveting interactive study on how personal prejudices, preconceived notions, and blind stubbornness can impact justice.\n\nDirected by Sidney Lumet and presented in the stark black and white cinematography of the 1950s, the movie takes place almost entirely within the confines of a single, sweaty room, where twelve jurors decide the fate of a defendant in a murder case. Despite the limited setting, the narrative never feels dull or claustrophobic, partially due to the brilliant character development and the enthralling performances of its ensemble cast.\n\nEach man, representing an assortment of backgrounds and attitudes, is given a chance to shine, and all the actors make the most of their respective moments under the spotlight. Chief among them is Henry Fonda, whose calm and level-headed Juror 8 provides a stark contrast to the hot-headed Juror 3, played brilliantly by Lee J. Cobb.\n\nThe script by Reginald Rose is a masterpiece of tension and conflict. Despite the unanimous decision needed for the jury to reach a verdict, viewers are introduced to differing perspectives, biases, and fallacies existing within the group. Each man's judgments reveal more about his own character than the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\n\n\"12 Angry Men\" is nothing short of a thought-provoking, tension-filled lesson in storytelling. It exquisitely illustrates how differing views cause friction, how people are quick to judge based on appearance and background, and how truth can be a matter of perspective. This film not only stands the test of time but remains a piercing and relevant comment on the flaws of our legal system and the nature of humanity itself.",
    "The Ring is an impeccable adaptation of a Japanese horror film, 'Ringu'. It masterfully switches gears from being a mysterious investigation to a spine-chilling ghost story. Factionalized by a solid plot, the movie walks you through the terror of a cursed videotape whose viewers unsuspectingly condemn themselves to a terrifying fate.\n\nThis film harnesses the potential of horror in a manner that transcends cheap jump scares. The director skilfully uses disturbing imagery, suspenseful music, and haunting sequences to create a gut-wrenching, frightening psychological horror experience. The central premise, while fantastical, is embroidered with chilling believability thanks to the convincing performances and coherent storyline. \n\nNaomi Watts delivers an exceptional performance, articulately portraying a journalist and mother who is helplessly swept up in the terrifying vortex of the cursed video's lore. Her character’s transformation from scepticism to terror-stricken desperation induces viewers to invest deeply in her fate. \n\nOne of the most striking aspects of this movie is its visual style. The dark, atmospheric cinematography creates an eerie and unsettling ambience that intensifies the sense of dread. The distorted and unnerving images within the cursed tape itself prove to be nightmarishly unforgettable. \n\nThe Ring utilizes its slow-burn narrative to build tension that culminates in a brilliantly unexpected finale. It challenges the complacency of expecting predictable resolution in a horror film. The well-crafted climax lingers beyond the screen, forcing the viewer to fathom the unsettling implications.\n\nOverall, The Ring is a superbly directed film that revives and redefines the horror genre, providing a deeply haunting cinematic experience. Its melange of suspense, fright, and mystery make it stand at the vanguard of American horror movies. It plays on primal fears and the terror of the unknown, leaving viewers desperately gripping their seats. A must-watch for those seeking intelligently crafted horror with a heavy dose of psychological chills.",
    "\"Saving Private Ryan\" remains one of the most impactful and visceral cinematic experiences ever crafted. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film fuses an emotionally compelling narrative with harrowing war scenes, creating a cinematic masterpiece still unparalleled in the genre.\n\nThe film begins with an incredibly intense, gut-wrenching 25-minute sequence of the D-Day invasion on Omaha Beach. The viewer is immediately thrust into the gritty chaos of war, effectively capturing the confusion, intensity, fear, and courage of the soldiers. Spielberg brilliantly portrays the raw brutality of war, leaving viewers overwhelmed and deeply moved.\n\nAt the center of the movie stands the compelling story of Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), the last surviving brother of four, serving in the World War II. A group of men, led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is tasked with finding and bringing home Private Ryan. This seemingly simple premise is densely packed with exploration of themes such as courage, sacrifice, and the brutal effects of war on the human spirit.\n\nThe performances across the board are superlative. Tom Hanks delivers a remarkable, riveting performance that anchors the film. Matt Damon, as Private Ryan, gives a praiseworthy act that blends innocence, bravery, and anguish in equal measure. The supporting cast, which includes the likes of Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, and Vin Diesel, adds depth and richness to the film through their exceptional performances.\n\n\"Saving Private Ryan\" is carefully constructed, with Spielberg's effective storytelling being complemented by Janusz Kaminski's brilliant cinematography. The camera work is breathtaking and immersive, thrusting the viewer right into the heart of the action. The battle scenes are spectacularly disorienting and disturbingly realistic, highlighting the gruesome realities of World War II.\n\nThe film goes beyond the typical war narrative by focusing on the value of human life and the genuine struggle faced by soldiers. The exploration of such thoughtful themes is what sets \"Saving Private Ryan\" apart from other war films. It is as much about the inner psychological battles as it is about the physical war happening around them.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Saving Private Ryan\" is an absolute must-watch for anyone who appreciates powerfully told stories infused with memorable performances and breathtaking cinematography. Spielberg not only offers a gritty, in-your-face look at the horrors of war but also eloquently demonstrates the resilience of the human spirit amidst chaos and destruction. This film is both a cinematic spectacle and a profound study of humanity that will linger in your mind long after the credits roll.",
    "\"Kick-Ass\" certainly lives up to its title with a highly engaging, adrenaline-pumping, blend of quasi-realist and comic-book absurdity. The movie deftly navigates an edgy narrative, populated with average Joes courageously (or foolishly) donning superhero costumes, and hitting the streets to fight crime.\n\nAaron Taylor-Johnson, as the title character Dave Lizewski / Kick-Ass, tremendously depicts an average teenager with no real superpowers, convincingly portraying his transformation into a self-styled vigilante. The ensemble cast is a tour-de-force with Hit-Girl, played with a fierce bravado by Chloë Grace Moretz, steals the limelight. The interplay between the outrageous Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and his katana-wielding pint-sized daughter Hit-Girl adds an unexpected layer of dark humor and emotional depth. Mark Strong and Christopher Mintz-Plasse also deliver great performances, adding to the overall uniquely balanced and multifaceted tone of the film.\n\nDirector Matthew Vaughn has fashioned a surprise package tailored with innovative action sequences, witty dialogues, and an oddly charming plot that transforms a seemingly adolescent comic premise into a commentary on real-world violence and consequences. The fusion of gritty realism and eccentric comic-book violence are deftly handled, making the viewer oscillate between laughter, shock, and edge-of-the-seat excitement.\n\nThe movie's R-rating should not be taken lightly as it boasts a generous amount of profanity, graphic violence, and dark humor. It's definitively not a family-friendly superhero flick, and this serves to its advantage, allowing a level of creative freedom seldom seen in traditional masked vigilante narratives.\n\n\"Kick-Ass\" is a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre that cleverly subverts comic-book conventions, offering a raucously entertaining, action-packed experience that lives up to its audacious title.",
    "The Shawshank Redemption is a remarkable film - a stirring tale of hope, friendship, and triumph of the human spirit embedded within the desolate confines of a maximum-security prison. It touches on themes that are timeless, and perhaps more relevant in our current state than when the movie was made.\n\nThe film masterfully captures the transformation of our protagonist, Andy Dufresne, played phenomenally by Tim Robbins. From a quiet banker framed for his wife's murder to an inspiring beacon of hope in the darkest corners of the Shawshank State Penitentiary, his character's journey is intriguing and captivating. \n\nMorgan Freeman is equally impressive as the seasoned inmate Ellis 'Red' Redding, whose narration adds depth and perspective to the story. The chemistry between these two characters and how their friendship unfolds over the dehumanising atmosphere of the prison is a compelling plot element. \n\nFrank Darabont's direction in this film is exceptional. The way he uses the cinematic tools at his disposal to create an oppressive prison atmosphere and contrast it with symbols of hope and freedom makes for a visually powerful movie. Thomas Newman's score envelopes the film in a cocoon of melancholic melancholy, playing into the narrative seamlessly. \n\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" isn't an easy film to watch, and it's meant to be that way. It gives audiences a grim depiction of the prison system, and yet, amidst the harsh realities it portrays, the film also promises a beacon of hope. It assures us that even in the grimmest circumstances, there can be friendship and dreams unbroken. \n\nThe ending of the film, without giving away any spoilers, strikes a perfect balance of satisfaction and joy for the viewer. It concludes an intense narrative journey with an emotionally fulfilling resolution, leaving a profound impact that lingered long after the credits rolled.\n\nIn essence, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a timeless classic that reminds us all that hope can pull us through the darkest times and that redemption is possible for everyone.

    "\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" is a mesmerizing adaptation of John le Carré's Cold War-era espionage novel. The movie embraces the gloom and paranoia of the Cold War and embeds it in every aspect of its storytelling.\n\nGary Oldman gives a poignantly restrained performance as George Smiley, the retired intelligence operative, whose painstaking investigation to uncover a mole inside the British Intelligence forms the core of the film. This is a different spy movie, devoid of fast-paced action sequences, instead relying on suspense, intelligence, and Oldman's nuanced portrayal. It is a testament to Oldman's brilliant performance that he dominates the screen, despite being surrounded by a star-studded cast including Colin Firth, Toby Jones, John Hurt, and Benedict Cumberbatch, all delivering phenomenal performances.\n\nDirector Tomas Alfredson has crafted the narrative in a way that it purposefully confuses and challenges the viewers to piece together Smiley's investigation. The storytelling is complex but rewarding for those who enjoy a slow-burn thriller. Alfredson uses silence and the drab setting of the 1970s London to heighten the tension and intrigue. It also adds an incredible layer of authenticity to the film, as it very meticulously borrows from the colour palette of the period.\n\nThe cinematography is meticulously crafted, using everything from the drab office settings to the play of light and shadow to enhance the sense of unease and uncertainty. The suspense is maintained masterfully, making the viewers jump at the smallest noises, continually reminding us of the high-stakes nature of the story.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" is a mesmerizing piece of cinema that challenges conventions of the genre and rewards the viewers for their patience and attentiveness. Despite the surface calm, it is engrossing, intense, and deeply intelligent, a true homage to the source material. If you're in the mood for an intricate tale of espionage that drills into the darkness of the human soul, \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" comes highly recommended.",
    "\"The Untouchables\" stands tall as an iconic classic of the crime drama genre. Brian De Palma's direction is impeccable and showcases his legendary storytelling capabilities. Every performance in the film, from that of Sean Connery’s seasoned mentor to Robert De Niro's Al Capone, leaves a lasting impression that resonates well after the end credits roll. \n\nKudos to David Mamet for crafting such a fantastic screenplay. He does an excellent job of sketching out the characters while maintaining the intricate plot set during the Prohibition-era Chicago. The exchanges between Eliot Ness, played by Kevin Costner, and his team of disparate officers nicknamed 'The Untouchables,' not only build suspense but also furnish viewers with intricate details about the characters’ internal worlds.\n\nAside from the brilliant performances by the key players, the supporting cast also shines. Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith's remarkable depiction of law enforcement agents battling their inner conflicts lend an edge to the narrative. The production design, recreating 1930s Chicago, is aesthetically pleasing and further enhances the movie’s authenticity.\n\nHowever, the real gem of the film lies within the captivating cinematography and its infamous tension-filled staircase scene, which is in itself worth the price of admission. Stylistically, the film utilizes slow-motion sequences to not only emphasize the gravity of the situation but also to highlight De Palma's unique eye for visual storytelling.\n\nOne cannot forget to mention Ennio Morricone's evocative, Oscar-nominated score. The score, punctuating the film’s inflection points, creates a palpable atmosphere of danger, uncertainty, and heroism. \n\nIn conclusion, \"The Untouchables” is a stellar movie illustrating the Prohibition era's struggle against brutality and corruption. While it might be considered violent for some, the film nevertheless delivers a masterfully executed storyline, stellar performances, and exquisite cinematography, making it a must-watch for anyone who appreciates cinema at its finest.",
    "\"Lucky Number Slevin\" is a smart, stylish crime thriller that combines wry humor, sleek visuals and slick dialogue to create a highly entertaining cinematic experience. Propelled by a captivating mystery, the movie's unique and complex narrative structure continuously keeps the audience second-guessing about the true nature of its characters and their motivations. \n\nIn a genre that is often filled with clichéd characters, \"Lucky Number Slevin\" stands out with its assembly of unique, deeply layered personas. Josh Hartnett crafts an exceptional performance as Slevin, bringing a mix of charm and nonchalance that makes his character admittedly engrossing. However, it is the performances of the supporting cast, including Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Lucy Liu, and Bruce Willis that makes this movie a gem. Every actor is given room to breathe and deliver, hence capturing the audience's interest and adding depth to the narrative.\n\nThe quality of Paul McGuigan’s stylish direction cannot be overstated. The intricate plot is revealed in a non-linear fashion, deliberately keeping viewers engrossed while carefully unravelling the underlying motive. \"Lucky Number Slevin\" does a commendable job of maintaining a steady pace, infusing just enough action sequences to keep adrenaline junkies entertained without detracting from the overall plot.\n\nSimilarly, the script is another shining star of this movie. Written by Jason Smilovic, the dialogue is smart, snappy and saturated with humour that beautifully lightens the intense mood. References to old detective novels and classic noir intrigue envelops the story, creating nostalgic resonations.\n\nOne of the integral attractions of the movie is its elegant visual treatment. The use of pastel colours, stylized sets, and unconventional framings lend a distinct aesthetic appeal that underlines the movie's artistic vision.\n\nBut \"Lucky Number Slevin\" isn't without its downsides. The plot can get slightly convoluted, and the non-stop twists may baffle some viewers. Yet, the denouement is worth the effort as everything falls into place spectacularly. \n\nOverall, \"Lucky Number Slevin\" manages to traverse the delicate line between a savvy crime thriller and a witty black comedy – making it a must-watch for genre lovers.

The movie beautifully captures the emotional depth and complexity of dealing with grief, interlaced with a tasteful sprinkling of humor and romance, preventing it from becoming a melancholic display of sorrow.\n\nHilary Swank delivers an incredibly raw and heartfelt portrayal of the lead character, Holly, a grieving widow who is trying to cope with the loss of her husband, portrayed convincingly by Gerard Butler. The chemistry between Swank and Butler is palpable, providing the authenticity required to drive the narrative. Not to be forgotten, Lisa Kudrow, Harry Connick Jr., and Gina Gershon brought the perfect amount of well-timed comic relief and a sense of camaraderie to the mix.\n\nCommitting to its genre as a romantic drama, the movie showcases a series of love letters left behind by Butler's character, guiding Holly through her grief. This notion is both novel and incredibly moving, inducing a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the film. However, the plot is predictably clichéd at times.\n\nDirector Richard LaGravenese does a commendable job of depicting the beauty of Ireland, creating a believable and significant connection between the location and the story. The cinematography is visually pleasing and sets the ambience effectively. The soundtrack of the movie compliments the tale and does an exceptional job of adding another layer of depth to the story.\n\nWhile \"P.S. I Love You\" isn't without its flaws, including a somewhat predictable plot and occasionally overdone sentimentality, it's hard to deny its emotional resonance. Viewers looking for a heartfelt movie about love, loss, and friendship will likely be brought to tears.

Astounding in scope and detail, the world-building in \"Warcraft\" is both vast and invigorating. The CGI is near flawless, the production design is grand and the costumes and makeup, especially for the orcs, are commendable.\n\nTop-notch visual effects bring the heavily muscled orcs to life, making them as expressive and emotionally engaging as their human co-stars. The clash between the human-led Alliance and the orcish Horde is thrilling, showcasing engaging battle sequences that are as heart-pounding as they are visually enchanting.\n\nThe performances overall are solid, especially Toby Kebbell as the conflicted orc Durotan. His performance infuses his digital character with a strong sense of humanity and emotional depth, effectively proving that performance capture technology can convey subtle expressions and emotions. Paula Patton also stands out, offering a feisty portrayal of the half-human, half-orc Garona.\n\n\"Warcraft,\" however, stumbles with its pacing and narrative coherence. The plot, though undeniably ambitious, can feel overwhelming at times, especially for those unfamiliar with the source material. Characters and subplots come and go swiftly, sometimes leaving audience members feeling lost.\n\nThe emotional depth is occasionally lost amidst the multilayered plot lines and relentless action sequences. But overall, \"Warcraft\" does a commendable job in constructing an engaging narrative out of a source material basically structured around repetitive conflict and territorial acquisition.\n\nThe bold ending sets the stage for future films, hinting at the expansive nature of the Warcraft universe yet to be explored. Despite any narrative pitfalls, \"Warcraft\" stands as a visually stunning, creatively ambitious adaptation that augurs well for future video game-turned-movie projects.

    "\"Sicario\" is a gripping, hard-hitting crime thriller that exposes the underbelly of the relentless drug war at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. The storytelling is tight and intense with a nerve-wracking realistic depiction of the escalating tension and violence. \n\nEmily Blunt plays Kate Macer, a tough, by-the-book FBI agent who's recruited into a special task force run by a mysterious and unconventional operative, Alejandro, played by Benicio del Toro. Their performances are simply stellar. Blunt is excellent as the moral compass of the story, her expressions of confusion and terror illustrating the nightmarish world she's been sucked into. \n\nOn the other hand, Del Toro's performance is chillingly outstanding. His character's true intent and motive keep you guessing throughout the film. He gives a quiet, brooding portrayal of a man with a deeply disturbing past, resulting in a captivating character that is truly unforgettable.\n\nThe direction by Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve is remarkable. He maintains a steady, building tension throughout and manages to carefully balance the prevailing darkness with moments of genuine humanity. The camera work is brilliant with some exceptionally stunning shots of the desolate landscapes creating a palpable sense of impending danger.\n\nAdding to this is the film score by the late Jóhann Jóhannsson, which is spine-chilling and adds an extra layer of suspense to the gripping narrative. It creates a deep sense of dread and untold horror that stealthily underlies every scene.\n\nWhile \"Sicario\" doesn't shy away from showcasing the harsh realities of the world it portrays, it doesn't do so in an exploitative manner. Instead, it serves as a mirror into a grim and brutal reality, urging its viewers to question the global implications of the drug trade and the secretive operations involved in controlling it. \n\nIn conclusion, \"Sicario\" is a visceral, thought-provoking journey into a world of darkness and deceit, skillfully told and powerfully acted.

His lightning-fast wit and impeccable comedic timing fill the airwaves and the screen, and one cannot help but get drawn into his charismatic charm. Robin Williams as Cronauer is both hilarious and deeply human, embodying the spirit of an individual trying to bring a glimmer of light into a grim and somber setting.\n\nDirector Barry Levinson expertly juxtaposes the harsh realities of war with Cronauer’s on-air antics, creating moments of laughter and levity, but never shying away from the pervasive sense of fear and unease that defined that period in history. The cinematography perfectly captures the chaos of the war-torn country and the vibrancy of the performances.\n\nOf note, too, is the soundtrack, which, filled with iconic songs from the late '60s, raises the energy of the film and furthers the vibrant, yet uneasy atmosphere. The film beautifully executes its less-than-ordinary attempt at presenting war from a perspective different from the battlefield-centered narratives more common to the genre.\n\nHowever, what truly makes \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" remarkable is its emotional depth. The film does an excellent job of humanizing the troops, showing how they grapple with realities of war, clinging onto fragments of home in a foreign land. Thanks to the brilliant script, the movie never feels preachy but allows the characters' experiences to speak for themselves.\n\nWhile laughing at Williams's improvisational masterclass, you are simultaneously made to pause and reflect on the horrors of a war that seem a million miles away from the resounding laughter, thus making \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" a unique viewing experience.

    "\"Sucker Punch\", directed by Zack Snyder, stands as a divisive entrant into the cinematic universe, eliciting strong reactions from its audience; people seem to either love it, or hate it. This genre-bending film utilizes elements of action, fantasy, steampunk, and pure imagination to tell a dark and twisted tale that subverts reality and fantasy.\n\nFrom the onset, \"Sucker Punch\" is both mesmerizing and visually breathtaking. Snyder's craftsmanship is exquisite; the stunning special effects, complex fight sequences, and atmospheric settings imbued with a sense of dreamlike surrealism are unquestionably remarkable. The film's aesthetics seem to echo the essence of a high-budget video game, with our protagonists transitioning from one fantastical mission to another, adding a unique dimension to the flag section of movies.\n\nOur protagonist, Baby Doll, excellently portrayed by Emily Browning, is commendable. Her performance as a troubled young woman subjected to a horrid reality is both heartfelt and engrossing. The rest of the cast, including Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung deliver strong performances, playing characters that are both complex and enigmatic.\n\nThe plot, however, is where \"Sucker Punch\" falls short. While it does present an interesting mix of multiple realities and symbolism, its complexity can often leave viewers perplexed. The film demands the audience's full attention and even then, it may require multiple viewings to fully comprehend its layered narrative.\n\nFurthermore, while some may appreciate the feminist subtext underlining the film - the idea of women reclaiming their power from oppressive systems - others may find its execution potentially problematic. The hyper-sexualization of its protagonists can be seen as contradictory to its purported feminist message.\n\nHowever, it is the film's multilayered approach which sets it apart. \"Sucker Punch\" is by no means a traditional narrative; it works on different levels and actively challenges conventional storytelling. For those open to a unique, visually stunning, and potentially disconcerting cinematic experience, \"Sucker Punch\" may resonate in unexpected ways. \n\nIn closing, \"Sucker Punch\" is an innovative piece of cinema that revels in its audacious absurdity and visual audacity.

    "\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" is a delightful mix of comedy, adventure, and music that stands as one of the Coen Brothers' most enjoyable films. The movie is an ingeniously conceived, lovably loose-lensed treatment of Homer's 'Odyssey', relocated to the Deep South during the Depression-era and filled with their trademark wit and inventiveness.\n\nThe narrative follows three convicts, masterfully portrayed by George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, as they embark on an epic journey to reclaim hidden treasure. Their adventure is riddled with wildly amusing episodes, whimsical characters, and unexpected events that keep viewers entertained from start to finish.\n\nClooney's bewildered charisma and comic timing, Turturro's zany antics, and Nelson’s dumb but sage outlook form a great triumvirate of talent that leaves us rooting for their success throughout their quest. The supporting cast, including John Goodman and Holly Hunter, shines as well, adding to the rich, colorful tapestry of the film.\n\nHowever, it's the superb incorporation of the American folk and blues soundtrack that forms the movie's throbbing heart; it not just serves as background score but it's where the film garners its true spirit and identity. \nThe cinematography deserves a special mention for capturing the dry, dusty expanses of the Deep South with alluring visual poetry.\n\nThe Coens' unconventional storytelling paired with the exploration of deeper themes like redemption, faith, and fate makes the film enjoyable to both casual and dedicated cinephiles.\n\nIn conclusion, \"O Brother Where Art Thou?\" is a magical, musical journey through a distinct period in American history.

It opens doors for mind games and philosophical considerations, leaving the audience thinking about the concept of consciousness and reality long after the credits roll.\n\nAlthough the decision to dabble in both sci-fi and thriller genres can feel a little confusing at times, the intricate detailing and the offbeat climax make up for it.

    "\"Jerry Maguire\" is arguably one of the best romantic comedy dramas made in the late 90s. Directed by Cameron Crowe, and starring Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, and Cuba Gooding Jr., the film delivers an endearing story laced with sharp humor, deep emotion, and real-life issues in both personal and professional relationships.\n\nTom Cruise, in one of his most legendary roles, plays Jerry Maguire, a high-flying sports agent who has a moral epiphany and is subsequently fired from his firm. Cruise’s charismatic performance is central to the film’s appeal. His portrayal of Maguire’s journey from cynical success to humbled failure and eventual real success is riveting. It's Cruise at his versatile best - the quintessential 'cocky man who falls, learns his lessons, and finds true love and purpose' story.\n\nRenee Zellweger is brilliant as Dorothy Boyd, a single mother who believes in Jerry’s vision and ultimately falls in love with him. Her earnest and endearing presence in the movie is refreshing and her on-screen chemistry with Cruise is palpable. \n\nBut it is Cuba Gooding Jr., playing the character of Rod Tidwell, an Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, who steals the show. Gooding Jr. injects a high-octane energy into the movie and provides some of its funniest and most poignant moments.\n\nThe screenplay by Cameron Crowe is a masterstroke, it provides a fresh and intimate perspective on the cut-throat world of sports management while weaving a deeply heartfelt love story. The movie’s most famous line, “Show me the money!” is iconic and has ever since been etched into pop culture memory.\n\nThe film does have its melodramatic moments that verge on the sappy, stretching the suspension of disbelief, but these are minor flaws in an otherwise beautifully executed cinematic piece.\n\nAll in all, “Jerry Maguire” is an enjoyable film that delivers on many fronts – it’s a love story, a sports drama, and a reflection on the struggles of maintaining integrity in a profit-driven society. It appeals to both the romantics who swoon over Cruise and Zellweger’s love story, as well as the sports enthusiasts who get behind-the-scenes insights into the world of sports agents.",
    "Stanley Kubrick has proved his mastery in movie-making with the intense psychological thriller, 'The Shining' . The film, based on Stephen King's hard-hitting novel of the same name, exhibits a spine-chilling narrative and characters that tug at the darkest corners of your fears.\n\nJack Nicholson as Jack Torrance has delivered a career-defining performance, perfecting the mannerisms of a deranged mind enthralled by sinister forces. His transition from a loving husband and father to a man possessed by his own demons is layered and entrancing. Shelley Duvall, playing Wendy Torrance, portrays the terrified wife and mother with such raw and harrowing emotion that it becomes impossible not to empathize with her.\n\nKubrick’s directorial stylings are on top form, turning the Overlook Hotel, with its unsettling maze-like corridors, into a symbol of mental unraveling, capturing the essence of claustrophobia and isolation. The musical score is ominous in the most skin-crawling way, creating a mood of constant foreboding that complements the narrative.\n\nThe camera work is truly inventive, grabbing close-ups of Nicholson's deranged facial expressions and wide-angle shots of the hedged maze and desolate hotel, to cultivate unmitigated horror. It is the labyrinth-style shooting and Kubrick's uncanny ability to create suspense that sets 'The Shining' apart from the conventional horror film genre.\n\nThat being said, 'The Shining' is not for the faint-hearted. It drifts from the generally formulaic horror storytelling and dips into the profound psychological horror, a mind game often left unexplored in mainstream Hollywood.\n\nSubtle metaphors and allegories peppered throughout the narrative require a keen eye and a propensity for looking beyond the obvious. In essence, the film challenges you to think and in doing so, takes you on a grotesque journey inwards to the recesses of your own mind. Hence, it may not appeal to those seeking a simple, straightforward scare.\n\nIn conclusion, while 'The Shining' is slow-burning, it retains warmth in its artistic depiction of psychological distress and downright horror. Kubrick, with his brilliant camera work, aesthetically pleasing visual narrative, and dramatic performances by A-list actors, has created a timeless masterpiece. 'The Shining' transcends the traditional format of horror movies to create an art house genre fueled by suspense, fear, and deep understanding of humanity's darkest capabilities.",

It shows us the men behind the masks, the sacrifice they made, the camaraderie they developed, and the nerves they battled, which adds depth and makes the unlikely success even more gripping.\n\nSpeaking of authenticity, the film's period details are meticulously rendered, effectively transporting viewers back in time to the troubled late 1970s era - a time when America needed a reason to believe in itself again. The movie does a phenomenal job of linking the sports narrative to a larger socio-political atmosphere, subtly reminding us why the victory carried such significance beyond the sporting landscape.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Miracle\" is more than just a hockey movie or a sports movie.

    "The Terminal is a charming and entertaining tale fortified by a classic Steven Spielberg touch and a rivocally enigmatic performance by the versatile Tom Hanks. The movie ventures into familiar territory with its tried and true elements of comedy, drama, romance and humanity, feeling cozy like an old blanket always ready to provide warmth. The film captures the story of a man who becomes stuck in the limbo of an airport terminal due to unique, geopolitical circumstances.\n\nWhile the premise may appear absurdly comedic, it is a noteworthy testament to Spielberg's mastery and to Hanks' virtuosity as an actor that this film absorbs you and keeps you riveted from the opening credits to the end. It also subtly touches upon themes of human dignity, diversity, friendship, love, and the often sterile, impersonal nature of modern life.\n\nHanks' portrayal of Viktor Navorski is imbued with innocence, simplicity, and charm, capturing the essence of a man who is adrift in an alien world, yet finds friendship, respect, and even love in an indifferent environment. The supporting cast, led by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci, imbues the narrative with convincing performances, each with their own mini-storyline that adds depth to the overall plot.\n\nSpielberg's deft handling of Janusz Kaminski's cinematography and John Williams' enchantingly magical background score aids in creating an immersive environment, complete with the architectural grandeur of an airport terminal transformed into a character in its own right.\n\nHowever, Spielberg does not let his characters drown in melodrama. The light-hearted humor, cleverly woven into the script, offsets the rather grim reality of Viktor's predicament, giving the movie a warm and fuzzy sitcom-like feeling. \n\nThe Terminal may not boast weighty themes or monumental conflict, but it is a heartwarming human story that will make you laugh, cheer, and perhaps, shed a tear.

Armando Iannucci, best known for his wry political satires, concocts a film that puts a comedic spin on one of the darkest periods in Russia.\n\nThe ensemble cast, including Steve Buscemi, Michael Palin, and Simon Russell Beale, skillfully treads the line between ludicrous humor and grim terror. They navigate chaos, power vacuum, and concealed personal agendas with wickedly sharp deliveries on the script's finely honed dark comedy. \n\nWith a clever mixture of fictionalization and historical events, \"The Death of Stalin\" offers a piercing critique of totalitarian governments while making sure the audience is kept laughing hysterically even during moments of profound shock.\n\nYet, the real entertainment comes from seeing each character scramble for power while maintaining the façade of cordial public servants. Their self-serving hypocrisy is portrayed so absurdly that despite its grim undertone, it's impossible not to find it comically captivating. \n\nSimon Russell Beale, in particular, is a revelation as Lavrenti Beria. He skillfully maneuvers between being sinister and comically grotesque; it's a performance that is far too nuanced to go unnoticed.\n\nThe film merges slapstick humor and immense fear, creating an atmosphere that is both hilarious and terrifyingly nihilistic. It's a credit to Iannucci's brilliant direction and sharp writing that the film never falters or loses its footing within this unique tonal range.\n\nOverall, \"The Death of Stalin\" is unique in its category—a hilarious look at a tragic moment of history, full of sharp wit and acerbic dialogue. It doesn't shy away from the horrors of Stalin's regime, but rather than showing the violence explicitly, it portrays it through an absurd lens, exposing the absurdity of unchecked power. \n\nDespite the comedic treatment of a tragic historical event that might raise a few eyebrows, it's necessary to understand that \"The Death of Stalin\" isn't trying to dilute the potency of this terrifying period of history. Instead, it suggests how laughter is sometimes the only response left at the face of such unimaginable horror. \n\nSo, if you appreciate dark comedic pieces with intelligent political commentary and brilliant acting, \"The Death of Stalin\" is a movie not to miss. Its unique blend of absurd humor, horrifying real events, and political satire makes it an enlightening watch in today's political climate.",
    "I had the privilege of watching \"How to Train Your Dragon\" with modest expectations and was delightfully surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The film unfolds not only as a dazzling, fast-paced animation feast but also as a story embedded with tenderness, heart, and lessons of understanding, courage and friendship.\n\nThis DreamWorks animation takes you into the visually stunning Viking world, where a young Viking, Hiccup, aspires to follow the village tradition by becoming a dragon slayer. The turn of events that leads to Hiccup finding, befriending, and ultimately training a dragon named Toothless is beautifully depicted, breaking stereotypes and enhancing the adventure quotient significantly.\n\nThe animation quality of the film is exceptional.

The flying sequences, in particular, are absolutely breathtaking, offering viewers the exhilarating rush of soaring through the wide-open sky.\n\nVoice casting is spot-on, with Jay Baruchel infusing Hiccup with an irresistible blend of underdog vulnerability and adolescent wryness. America Ferrera, Gerard Butler, and Craig Ferguson lend strong voice support, fleshing out their roles with depth and personality.\n\nWhat really touched me about \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is the heartwarming bond between Hiccup and Toothless. Despite their natural roles as mortal enemies, they build a transcending camaraderie, shifting the narrative into a commentary on acceptance, understanding, and breaking the chains of the status quo.\n\nWhile the movie is packed with suspense and action, it also expertly balances humor and emotion.

    "The Coen Brothers' \"Hail, Caesar!\" is a delightful satirical homage to Hollywood's Golden Age - perhaps more a loving parody of that era rather than a critique. The storyline basically centers around a day in the life of a movie studio 'fixer', Eddie Mannix, played brilliantly by Josh Brolin. \n\n\"Hail, Caesar!\" unpredictably weaves itself in and out of various movie sets, scripts and characters, which at first may seem confusing. However, this seemingly disjointed narrative perfectly captures the chaotic flurry within a movie studio. The film delivers a string of enjoyable set-pieces, each parodying different genres of Hollywood’s Golden Age. From Scarlett Johansson's aquatic spectacle with unfortunate swimsuits, to Channing Tatum’s tap-dance spectacular on a sailors' stage, to the flows and missteps of period dramas and musicals. Each scene in its own way is comically satisfying and a visual delight.\n\nYet, behind the film's light humor and beautiful cinematography lurks a subtle screenplay filled with deeper themes. It explores the contradictions of Hollywood, the struggle between art and commerce, the industry's impact on personal life, and the role faith plays in guiding one’s moral compass.\n\nThe actors, particularly Brolin, Tatum, George Clooney and Alden Ehrenreich, deliver standout performances. Brolin as the tough yet weary-minded fixer exhibits an incredible range of emotions with finesse. Ehrenreich, as the singing cowboy, provides one of the most hilarious sequences in the film, giving a glimpse of his exceptional comedic timing.\n\nHowever, those not familiar with the Coen Brothers' style or the context of the 1950s Hollywood could possibly miss out on some of the film's charm. \"Hail, Caesar!\" requires a certain knack for appreciating a milder, subtler form of comedy and satire that the Coens have masted over the years.\n\nOverall, with its offbeat humor, excellent period detail, fine performances and a fancifully convoluted plot, \"Hail, Caesar!\" stands as a fine tribute to the begone era of Hollywood. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those attuned to the Coen Brothers' specific brand of cinema, it is indeed a treat to watch.",
    "No doubt in my mind that Pixar has done it again with the movie \"Brave\". This is an animated movie that breaks away from the usual princess waiting to be rescued storyline. It tells the story of Merida, an independent, strong-willed Scottish princess who would rather follow her own path than adhere to the traditional norms of her time. \n\nPixar's top-notch animation is a visual delight, perfectly capturing the breathtaking landscapes of the Scottish Highlands. It is a feast for the eyes, imbued with spectacular visuals that make the movie a sheer aesthetic extravaganza. The animators have put meticulous attention into even the smallest of details - Merida’s flaming red curls ripple and shine with such remarkable realism that it's hard to believe they're not real.\n\nThe story of a rebellious princess trying to carve her own fate and make her mark in the world is both moving and empowering. The element of mother-daughter relationship adds another layer of emotion, providing heart and soul to the larger than life adventure.\n\nVoice work is also compelling, especially Kelly Macdonald who gives life to Merida. Her Scottish accent lends an authentic feel, and she excels at showing Merida's range of emotions.\n\nAnother highlight of \"Brave\" is the stunning musical score, which truly enhances the viewing experience. The blend of traditional Celtic music intensifies the Scottish feel and augments the story’s atmosphere perfectly. \n\nHowever, \"Brave\" is more than just aesthetics. It carries a strong and important message, presenting a whole new view of what a \"princess\" can and should be. It addresses freedom, bravery, and understanding, imparting a subtle yet impactful life lesson to its audience.\n\nWhilst the plot might not be as intricate as some other Pixar offerings, it is the perfect balance of humor, real emotions and values that makes it so special.\n\nAll in all, \"Brave\" is a visually striking masterpiece that speaks to all ages. It serves as an encouraging reminder that true bravery comes from within, and that it's never too late to rectify our mistakes and mend broken relationships. A shining piece of storytelling and animation!",
    "\"The Longest Yard,\" directed by Peter Segal, is a fun-filled remake that manages to balance the realms of comedy and American Football while adding an intriguing twist of prison life. The film showcases Adam Sandler's acting versatility as we watch him transition from swindled, drunk NFL player to convicted felon to reluctant Football coach for his fellow inmates.\n\nThe supporting cast is absolutely magnificent. The star-studded cast, including Chris Rock and Burt Reynolds, brilliantly complements Sandler's charismatic performance, adding depth to the narrative. Burt Reynolds, who was a part of the original 1974 film, makes this movie nostalgic and worth watching. Every character is uniquely crafted, and their quirks and personalities make you connect and root for each of them. \n\nOne of the film's highlights is the stunning action-packed football scenes. The director captures football's adrenaline-fueled nature, making the audience feel like they're right there on the field. The game sequences are orchestrated perfectly with humor, making this film hilariously engaging.\n\nBut the film isn't all laughs and sports; there's an underlying theme of redemption and self-discovery. Each of the prison inmates battles their own demons and past mistakes while forming an unconventional brotherhood, highlighting the potential for camaraderie and unity even in bleak circumstances.\n\nHowever, the film's narrative can be predictable at times, and the humor borders on crass. Additionally, the depiction of prison life is highly glamorized, which might seem unrealistic and may not appeal to everyone's taste.\n\nNonetheless, the film's overall appeal lies in its brilliant blend of humor, action, and heart. The snappy one-liners, football action, and the outstanding performances by the cast make \"The Longest Yard\" an entertaining watch. It's a movie that one can enjoy on a lazy Sunday afternoon from the comfort of their couch. Despite its shortcomings, it is an enjoyable feel-good film for Sandler fans and football enthusiasts.",
    "\"Mother!\" is undoubtedly a daunting cinematic experience that propels the viewer into a whirlpool of chaos and insanity. Directed by the acclaimed Darren Aronofsky, the film is an allegorical tale that remains shrouded in enigma from start to finish. Brace yourself for an emotional roller coaster as the narrative unfolds.\n\nJennifer Lawrence delivers a compelling performance as the unnamed central role, managing to create a character full of complexity and angst. Her portrayal of abject confusion and desperate pleas for normalcy bring heart to the frenzied plot. Javier Bardem is equally captivating, with his aloof charisma and commanding screen presence effectively establishing him as the antagonist.\n\nThe movie excels artistically thanks to Matthew Libatique’s stunning cinematography and Andrew Weisblum’s razor-sharp editing, which create a surreal tone that only enhances the unnerving atmosphere of the film. Balancing symbolism and literal horror, Aronofsky strikes a unique tone that many will find intriguing, although it may alienate some viewers.\n\nHowever, despite its technical prowess, the film often descends into utter chaos, blending reality and metaphor so thoroughly that the plot becomes hard to follow. This stylistic choice, while innovative, can border on the overwhelming, adding a sense of disorientation to the already intricate storyline. \n\n\"Mother!\" also deserves praise for its willingness to confront complex and often uncomfortable themes. It is not a movie for the faint-hearted or those seeking a conventional night at the movies. Be prepared for uncomfortable silences and challenging portrayals of humanity.\n\nAll in all, \"Mother!\" is a bold and complex endeavour that amalgamates elements of psychological horror, domestic drama, and surreal allegory. Dedicated cinephiles and Aronofsky fans may revel in the film’s chaos and narrative complexity. Those seeking a traditional movie experience, however, may find it a befuddling labyrinth of metaphors. Nevertheless, \"Mother!\" is undeniably a film that will provoke thought and discussion long after the credits roll.",
    "\"L.A. Confidential,\" directed by Curtis Hanson, is nothing short of a masterpiece. Set in the 1950s, it's a neo-noir crime film that manages to meticulously weave crime, corruption, scandal, and morality into a phenomenal cinematic tapestry.\n\nThe plot is intricate, brutal, and brilliantly executed, bringing to light the more sinister side of life through the eyes of three policemen who embody strikingly different perspectives and methods. The movie's narrative is driven not only by the complex plot but also by the in-depth character analysis—one of the film's most triumphant technical aspects.\n\nThe performances are nothing short of remarkable with a stellar ensemble cast that includes Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, and Kevin Spacey. Each actor effectively portrays his character's emotional turmoils, moral dilemmas, and personality quirks. Particularly impressive is Kim Basinger, who provides a sublime performance as the Veronica Lake look-alike, Lynn Bracken. She embodies the vulnerability and strength of her character, turning her into more than just a beautiful facade.\n\n\"L.A. Confidential\" truly shines in its elaborate execution of its period setting. From clothing to dialogue, to the brilliantly designed set pieces, the authenticity of the era is stunning. Moreover, the cinematography is evocative and stylized, seamlessly blending the alluring glamour and the grim, sleazy underworld of Los Angeles.\n\nDespite its violent, gritty overtones, the movie does not rob itself of its witty dialogue and subtle humor, a welcome unexpected touch that adds depth to its characters while providing some relief for its audience. \n\nThe strikingly poignant and resonant finale is proof of how well-crafted the movie is. It doesn't offer any easy answers or clean resolutions but instead provides a riveting study of the moral complexities involved in seeking justice.\n\nIn all, \"L.A. Confidential\" is an epic and intelligent work of cinema, a compelling narrative spun against the backdrop of fascinatingly flawed characters that exist in a world painted with shades of grey. It is an astonishing film, a rare gem in the realm of neo-noir, that deserves every bit of acclaim it has received.\"",

It also touches on poignant themes, offering a mix of fun, drama, and heartwarming moments. \n\nHowever, what truly elevates \"Over the Hedge\" from other animated movies, is its profound and critical commentary on the urbanization of wildlife habitats. It is a gentle yet firm reminder about the importance of co-existence and respect for nature.\n\nDespite being a comedy, \"Over the Hedge\" subtly invites its audience to contemplate vital ecological questions, thus making it an enjoyable as well as thought-provoking movie.

Taron Egerton takes on the challenging task of echoing Elton's flamboyance, wit, and talent, delivering an awe-inspiring performance that not only showcases his acting prowess but his vocal skills as well. \n\nThe non-linear biopic adeptly weaves in Elton's chart-topping hits to match rhythm with the on-screen drama, each song meticulously chosen to highlight a particular moment or mood in his life. This integral focus on music makes the movie feel more like a musical than a traditional biopic, opening up the narrative to an exhilarating world of fantasy and visual spectacle.\n\nRocketman does not shy away from showcasing the darker shades of Elton John's life - his struggles with substance abuse, complicated relationships, and search for identity - presenting a complex and emotive human story beneath the glittery surface. The storytelling is visually-charged, adding a layer of extravagance to mirror the star's larger-than-life persona while maintaining authenticity in its portrayal of darker periods of his life. The supporting cast, especially Jamie Bell and Richard Madden, add depth and perspective to Elton's journey, enhancing the narrative with their powerful performances.\n\nHowever, it's the raw honesty and commitment Egerton brings to the role that makes Rocketman soar. From evoking Elton's isolation amidst fame and fans to his meteoric rise and fall and eventual resurgence, his performance resonates deeply.\n\nBeyond the glamour and sequins, Rocketman is a poignant examination of a talented man's journey through self-doubt, public expectations, addiction, and the relentless pursuit to find love and acceptance.

    "\"Me Before You\" is a beautifully executed romantic drama that leaves an indelible imprint on one's psyche. Based on Jojo Moyes' bestselling novel, the film stunningly explores the resilience of the human spirit in a uniquely bittersweet way.\n\nEmilia Clarke, known for her role as Daenerys Targaryen in \"Game of Thrones\", demonstrates her versatility in her vibrant portrayal of Louisa Clark, the cheery albeit quirky small-town girl tasked with caring for Will Traynor, played by Sam Claflin. Claflin, famous for his role as Finnick Odair in \"Hunger Games\", expertly exhibits a cynicism and desolation that could only stem from a life drastically changed by a disabling accident. The pair craft an unconventional and touching love story that evolves very naturally before your eyes.\n\nThe film manages to address the complex theme of assisted suicide with a delicate subtlety, while seamlessly exploring the intricacies of class and familial tensions in modern Britain. The filmmakers have been careful to not make the entire movie about Will's disability but rather about the couple’s burgeoning love and the broadening of their respective life perspectives.\n\nMoreover, the movie is visually captivating with picturesque locations and complimentary color palettes, creating an aesthetic as compelling as the narrative. The director, Thea Sharrock, skillfully draws out heartfelt performances so much that by the end, you will be hard-pressed to keep your eyes dry.\n\nOn another note, Janet McTeer delivers a commendable, nuanced portrayal as Traynor's mother while Charles Dance impresses as his emotionally distanced father.\n\nHowever, the film is not without its faults. \"Me Before You\" occasionally risks tipping into melodrama and its gazes into the disabled life might be seen as superficial. Yet, the emotional resonance of the film as a love story, its sensitive handling of the conflicting emotions around disability and assisted dying, as well as its ability to smile in the face of despair, make it a rewarding watch. Despite its heartbreaking conclusion, the movie manages to end on an invigorating note, which encapsulates the film's message about the importance of living life fully and fearlessly.",

    "A Hard Day's Night is a masterpiece that seamlessly blends music, comedy, and the iconic pop-culture appeal of The Beatles into a rollicking musical comedy adventure. The film captures the raw exuberance and irresistible cheeky charisma of the band members: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr in their heyday (1964). Moreover, the director, Richard Lester, underscores the Beatles' cultural significance and manages to infuse a frenzied spirit of youth and innocence that was representative of the '60s.\n\nA significant aspect of the film's success is its innovative mockumentary style, a pioneering effort during its time. It offers a fictionalized account of Beatles' life that, nevertheless, feels incredibly real and accessible to the audience. In this movie, The Beatles don’t just perform their iconic hits but rather live them; their music forms the backdrop of every scene, more like a free-flowing soundtrack brilliantly construing their adventures.\n\nThe interplay amongst the band's members is also a highlight. The witty dialogue found in the screenplay rings joyfully chaotic, reflecting their legendary camaraderie. Lennon's sarcastic humor, McCartney's sweet nature, Harrison's quiet charm, and Starr's seemingly dim persona are all utilized to the best for comic effects.\n\nAs a musical, the film's greatest strength lies in the unique blend of its soundtrack with surreal comedic sequences. Classics like “Can’t Buy Me Love,” “If I Fell,” and title track “A Hard Day’s Night” are performed within the narrative structure, showcasing the band’s thrilling on-stage energy. The quick cutting technique used during these sequences creates a sense of enthusiastic liveliness, making it hard to resist tapping a foot along with the tunes.\n\nThe film also offers a social commentary on the increasing commodification of popular musicians and explores themes of fame, fan frenzy, media manipulation, and commercialization. The Beatles are portrayed as both puppet and puppeteers - trapped in the whirlwind of their own dizzying fame yet intuitively understanding the game.\n\nA Hard Day's Night is a timeless cinematic gem that captures the essence of Beatlemania. It doesn't just entertain but provides valuable insight into why The Beatles were, and are, an international phenomenon. Their unfazed humor, brazen charm, and of course, exceptional music, all come to the forefront in this groundbreaking film. This is 'must-see' cinema for all music and film enthusiasts alike.",
    "\"Macbeth\", a timeless tale of power, ambition, and guilt, has been brought to life on the big screen countless times, but never quite like this. The director possesses an innate understanding of the source material that shines through every frame, endowing it with an unexpected freshness that keeps one riveted from start to finish.\n\nRight off the bat, the film's visual element impresses immensely. The color palette is masterfully chosen to reflect the narrative's increasing darkness and melancholy, and the cinematography is beyond stunning, making even the utmost chaos seem like a compelling, tragic ballet.\n\nHowever, the true driving force of the movie is the riveting performances by the cast. Macbeth is played with incredible conviction. The dye of the character’s ruthless ambition and looming guilt is powerfully portrayed. Lady Macbeth is equally captivating, imbued with a terrifying determination and layered vulnerability that breathes new life into the character. \n\nWe should also commend the director for the film's incredibly atmospheric sound design. The subtle background music, combined with the raw sounds of nature and battles, creates an audioscape that's as enthralling as the film is visually. \n\nThe screenplay stays true to Shakespeare's original work, while the dialogues retain their lyrical quality, they are pronounced with such believability that they seem less like verses from a 400-year-old play and more like actual conversations during those dire circumstances.\n\nAs the movie draws to its devastating climax, it leaves the audience with a profound silence, echoing the haunting reality of unchecked ambition and its eventual downfall. It also prompts the audience to reflect on the destructive nature of power and guilt, themes that remain as relevant today as they were during Shakespeare’s time.\n\nOverall, \"Macbeth\" is not just an adaptation; it's more of a reimagining that compels the audience to see a well-known tragedy from a fresh perspective. A feast for the senses and the intellect, this film will continue to cast its spell on you long after the credits have rolled. If you're a fan of Shakespeare, exquisite storytelling, or artistic cinema, do not miss it.",
    "\"Invincible\" is a heartwarming, inspirational cinematic take on the real-life tale of Vince Papale.

His compelling performance is not only entertaining but also emotionally engaging, doing full justice to the plot.\n\nThe story set in Philadelphia in the 1970s showcases the struggling Eagles NFL team. The movie does a commendable job of recreating the era's charm with a meticulous depiction of the socio-economic environment.

The motivational, never-give-up ethos of Invincible makes it a must-watch for not only sports enthusiasts but also for anyone who appreciates a well-told human story. \n\nIt has its fair share of predictable moments, as is common in biopics, but what sets Invincible apart is how it wonderfully encapsulates, the spirit of determination against all odds and imbues a sense of warmth and hope in every scene.",
    "\"Goon\" harbors a unique charm within its gritty narrative, where the allure of hockey is melded with warmth, humor, and genuineness. Seann William Scott's performance as Doug Glatt is undeniably powerful, a strikingly complex yet impressively relatable portrayal. It's particularly noteworthy that while he plays an enforcer on ice, off the field he's shown as a soft-hearted man concerned about others' wellbeing, illustrating a distinct bittersweet narrative.\n\n\"Goon\" graciously portrays hockey's brutal yet exhilarating nature. The on-ice action sequences are executed with an unfiltered raw intensity that engages the audience unabatedly.

Mr. Scott's knack for comedy shines brilliantly, giving the dialogue-driven scenes a refreshing light-heartedness.\n\nEvan Goldberg’s masterful screenplay doesn't shy away from infusing sentimentality either. The somewhat awkward but heartfelt relationship between Doug and Eva (Alison Pill) adds depth to the storyline, creating a balance between brutality and tenderness.\n\n\"Goon\" triumphs due to its ability to be straightforward and unpretentious. It has its heart in the right place, and its tender moments are as impactful as its violent, adrenaline-fueled sequences.

    "\"The Matrix Revolutions\", the third installment in the Matrix franchise, offers a visually stunning conclusion to the series. Directors, the Wachowskis, demonstrate their command of the sci-fi genre by effectively incorporating breathtaking visuals and imaginative action sequences that make the movie a cinematic feast.\n\nKeanu Reeves delivers a commendable performance as Neo, successfully portraying his character's evolution from uncertainty in the first movie to absolute conviction in this final showdown. It's his character development that glues together the elements in the movie, providing a consistent thread through VFX-laden scenes.\n\nThe plot, however, is admittedly more convoluted in this installment. It feels overstuffed with philosophical ideas that, while instrumental in building the Matrix universe, can still feel overwhelming. Action at times overshadows storytelling, causing obfuscation of certain themes. Despite this, the ending manages to tie the loose ends together rather effectively. It may be divisive for some viewers, but it's a bold move that provides a satisfactory resolution to the epic space-war saga.\n\nHugo Weaving as Agent Smith continues to leave a chilling impression. His omnipresent threat across the trilogy, coupled with his unerring determination to obliterate Neo, consistently adds tension and unpredictability to the film.\n\nThe action sequences in \"The Matrix Revolutions\" are unquestionably masterful. The Wachowskis crafted scenes that excellently blend CGI and live-action, creating a visual spectacle that keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n\nThe score of the movie is exceptional as well. It amplifies the action sequences and punctuates dramatic moments with precision. Just as effortlessly, it fluidly transitions to more somber notes during the quieter, introspective parts of the film.\n\nWhile \"The Matrix Revolutions\" may not be as groundbreaking as the first installment due to its somewhat complex philosophical exposition and its primary focus on action, it is still a remarkable cinematic achievement. The movie is a grand culmination of a series that has completely redefined the science-fiction genre, and while the narrative may seem layered, the Wachowskis deliver an ending worthy of the larger-than-life monolith they had built with The Matrix.\"",

It's remarkable how the actors have managed to make each character in their varying roles so distinct and memorable.\n\nVisual effects and cinematography are absolutely stunning, creating breathtaking vistas and worlds that captivated and drew me into every storyline. The makeup effects are also noteworthy, enabling the characters to cross gender, race, and age convincingly.\n\n\"Cloud Atlas's\" soundtrack is another element that should not go without remark. The music is mesmerizing; it not just complements but accents the visual storytelling. It’s a magical blend that pulls at your heartstrings, reflecting the mood and emotions of each scene perfectly.\n\nHowever, \"Cloud Atlas\" is not a movie for everyone. Its unconventional structure demands your full attention, asking the viewer to connect the dots. While some may find this challenging, the deliberate intricacies invite the viewer to engage wholly with the story’s depth.\n\nThe message of \"Cloud Atlas\" is profound and beautifully rendered: that we are all connected, that every action has a consequence, and that love and kindness can echo through the ages. It inspires introspection and emphasizes the impact of individual deeds on the grand tapestry of time. \n\nIn final analysis, \"Cloud Atlas\" is a grand cerebral epic—visually extravagant, ambitious in its conceptual scope and stimulating in its thematic depth.

The hauntingly beautiful music enhances the film's ethos - the melancholy, the joy, the tension. Also, the ending is bound to leave you contemplative, thinking about the vastness of the human spirit and the world around us.\n\nMy only criticism would be the length of the film.

However, this can be overlooked considering the overall enchanting experience \"The Big Blue\" provides.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Big Blue\" is an extraordinary film that, much like the sea, is profound and captivating.

His style captures the essence of Joy's world, a suburban landscape stifled by routine and conformity, and her daring leap into self-made entrepreneurship.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper, contribute substantially by adding layers of depth and juxtaposing perspectives. De Niro, playing Joy's father, particularly shines as he provides both the comic relief and some poignant moments.\n\nOn the technical side, the movie is gorgeously shot, with a keen eye for detail. The cinematography, the careful use of color and lighting echo the ups and downs of Joy's journey, enhancing the story visually.\n\nThe script does have its flaws at times, withholding some plot advancement, but Lawrence's commanding performance effectively overshadows these shortcomings. \n\nIn the end, \"Joy\" is not only a tribute to womanhood or entrepreneurship but also a heartening narrative about the human spirit's indomitable will to succeed.

    "\"American Sniper\" is a riveting exploration of a soldier's psyche amidst the turmoil of war. Clint Eastwood's outstanding directorial abilities amalgamate the decision-making intricacies and emotional turbulence experienced by individuals on the frontline effectively. \n\nBradley Cooper has rendered a stupendous performance as Chris Kyle, the deadliest sniper in U.S military history.

The film's ability to showcase the harsh realities of war and how debilitatively it haunts those who have experienced it, is undoubtedly its biggest achievement.\n\nWhile \"American Sniper\" has sparked debates about its political implications, it should be viewed primarily as a character study and an exploration of the human toll of war.

It's no wonder \"Gladiator\" triumphed at the box-office and won five golden statues at the Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Crowe.\n\nIt's worth mentioning Joaquin Phoenix's absorbing performance as the jealous, corrupt emperor Commodus. His portrayal is so compelling; it elicits strong emotions. The scenes between Crowe and Phoenix are electrifying, with both actors bringing their A-game.\n\nAlthough historical accuracy is arguable, Gladiator wasn't crafted as a documentary but a vivid, dramatic tale of heroism, which it delivers brilliantly. It's emotionally resonant, visually stunning, and overall, a triumph of film-making that resonates with viewers even two decades after its release. \n\nWhether or not you're a fan of historical dramas, \"Gladiator\" offers a cinematic experience too enduringly splendid to miss.",

The cinematography and sound design work in synergy, heightening the intensity of every scene. \n\nDespite its historical narrative, \"American Made\" refrains from taking a moralistic or judgmental stance. It doesn't glamorize Seal's actions nor does it condemn them, merely presenting the facts adorned with a hint of cinematic spectacle. However, it does provide an incisive commentary on the murky ethics of covert government operations during the era.\n\nThe supporting cast including Domhnall Gleeson and Sarah Wright give stellar performances matching the vitality of Cruise.

Throughout the years, the MCU has made an art form of weaving its multiple narratives together, and this film sets a new standard for the tapestry it has created.\n\nThe film kicks off with a tone setter from the first scene itself and dives headfirst into the rage and desperation of war. Every Avenger receives their share of the limelight - the regular outings are standouts as usual, but it's some of the side-players like Doctor Strange, The Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor who really steal the show. The ensemble cast is exceptional, without a single miscast or underperformance.\n\nThe desolate mad titan, Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, is a compelling villain characterized by both malevolence and unexpected depth.

The action sequences are visually stunning and the pacing is spot on. The humor hits where it needs to – never feeling forced or jarring alongside the film's darker elements. \n\nHowever, the movie's scope is so vast and its narrative so expansive, it requires a deep immersion into MCU lore to fully appreciate.

    "\"Semi-Pro\" is one of those films that you simply can't judge too harshly because it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is- a no-holds-barred, all-out comedy! The Will Ferrell factor is undoubtedly the driving force behind the film's humorous appeal. Ferrell's comedic timing is impeccable as he fully embraces the irreverent, absurd persona of Jackie Moon, who owns, coaches, and plays for his American Basketball Association team.\n\nThe film mirrors the mid-70s setting, colorfully incorporating gaudy suits, exaggerated hairdos, funky music, and goofy dance routines that only add to the humor. But what's really entertaining about \"Semi-Pro\" is its ensemble cast. Woody Harrelson, as Monix, delivers a stand-out performance with his character's unique blend of cynicism and determination. Andre Benjamin (Outkast's Andre 3000) as 'Coffee' Black, adds a refreshing layer of genuine basketball talent and comedic proximity. Together with Ferrell, they create a dynamic trio with a laugh-a-minute rapport.\n\nOne must admit the storyline feels disjointed at times, and not all jokes land with precision. But director Kent Alterman uses the 70s aesthetic and the sheer absurdity of the premise to maintain an entertaining atmosphere. You'll find the humor is less situated in the narrative and more embedded in the eclectic characters, ludicrous situations, and witty dialogue, meaning there's always something to tickle the funny bone.\n\nWhile \"Semi-Pro\" might not be a cinematic masterpiece by traditional standards, it's definitely a proficient comedy within its genre. Viewers looking for a light-hearted romp with a good dose of nostalgic 70's charm, ridiculous antics, and hilariously inappropriate humor should look no further as this film delivers on all fronts.\n\nRemember, it's not a film to be deeply analyzed or critically evaluated but to sit back and enjoy for its unashamedly funny, sometimes silly, but always entertaining content.\"",

Brie Larson embodies her character, Carol Danvers, with grace and determination, making it a force to be reckoned with. \n\nThe film breaks typical superhero tropes, allowing the female lead to shine in her own right. The storyline respects Danvers’s struggle between her past and the complex reality she recently awoke to, making her character arc not only exceptional but also relatable. The narrative further explores the Kree-Skrull war innovatively and seamlessly incorporates it into the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nThe secondary characters, such as Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury and Ben Mendelsohn's Talos, are well fleshed out and serve to provide depth and dimension to the overall narrative. The chemistry between Larson and Jackson is worth applauding, bringing an unexpected friendship amidst the chaos.\n\nThe 90s backdrop sets an exciting tone to \"Captain Marvel,\" utilizing nostalgia to its advantage with an exceptional soundtrack and various pop culture references. While the CGI work is top-notch, some scenes felt slightly overdone.\n\nNevertheless, Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck succeed in bringing a complex, multi-layered superhero to life while balancing comedy, drama, and action throughout the film. \"Captain Marvel\" serves as an inspiring intergalactic adventure with a powerful message of self-affirmation and gender equality. It's a successful prelude to the challenges the Avengers have yet to face, making the audience yearn for more. \n\nThe movie, overall, is a fantastic addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a milestone in its own way.

    "\"21 Jump Street\" seamlessly melds the aesthetics of buddy-cop action flicks, the wit of self-aware comedy, and the nostalgia of its namesake 1980s TV series into a film that is both entertaining and refreshingly smart. With a delightfully irreverent script, the movie manages to satirize the clichés of both high school dramas and police procedurals, while still constructing a humorous, authentic narrative arc that audiences can invest in.\n\nLeading the film are Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, two actors who may seem mismatched at first glance, but together create an uncanny and comedic chemistry. Hill’s geeky, quick-witted persona plays hilariously off of Tatum's athletic, somewhat dim-witted character. Both actors exhibit tremendous comedic timing and engage equally well in the film's more dramatic and action-filled scenes.\n\nOne of the film's most praiseworthy aspects is its script. It ingeniously combines satirical commentary on the genre, clever one-liners and a good heart at its core. It also successfully manages to poke fun at its origins, delivering plenty of nostalgic flashbacks for fans of the original series, while updating the story for a modern audience. You needn't be familiar with the series to enjoy the movie, though. It stands firmly on its own, independent of its namesake.\n\nThe action sequences scattered throughout the movie are well-crafted and exciting. They ride the line between being genuinely thrilling and just a little over-the-top. This balance enhances and mirrors the film's tone as a whole, offering an experience that is playfully self-aware and still energetically entertaining.\n\nThe supporting cast is also excellent, playing their roles with comedic precision, further adding to the film's overall enjoyment. Ice Cube, as the perpetually angry police captain, is a standout, delivering some of the funniest lines in the movie.\n\n\"21 Jump Street\" proves that an adaptation can preserve the essence of its source material while evolving in a way that feels timely and innovative. It is a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but offers a balanced mix of comedy, action, and heart. A must-watch for anyone seeking a fun and light-hearted entertainment.",
    "\"Gettysburg\" is a rare epic film that manages to capture history, drama, and human emotion with absolute brilliance and authenticity. The film, plotted around one of the most decisive battles in American history, manages to undress the glamor of war and reveal the harsh realities by illustrating the human faces behind the façade of valor and glory.\n\nWhile many historical films fall prey to the temptation of over dramatization, \"Gettysburg\" remains loyal to historical authenticity and accuracy, from its nuanced characters to the representation of their speeches and dialogues. The film successfully transports its viewers to the battlefields of 1863, capturing the thrills, horrors, tension, and strategies that marked this significant battle.\n\nDirector Ronald F. Maxwell's superbly detailed execution shines throughout the film. With a run-time of over four hours, the film takes its time to build up the plot and characters, instilling an emotional depth that few war films can compete with.\n\nThe performances are another high point of the film. Jeff Daniels as Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain gives a career-defining performance that oozes conviction. Tom Berenger's portrayal of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet is compelling and emotional, while Martin Sheen's Gen. Robert E. Lee is convincingly poignant and resonant, effectively humanizing these historical figures. \n\nAnd then there's the cinematography. The massive-scale reenactments of Pickett's Charge, the scenery of Pennsylvania, and the close-ups of the actors during speeches or in combat, bring the raw emotion and tactile experience of the battlefield to life.\n\nIt's worth noting, though, that the film is not just about war and fighting; it's also deeply philosophical. It explores the moral and ideological complexities on both sides of the war, which can be painful and thought-provoking, yet are important themes to consider.\n\nOne might argue that the movie is long-winded and takes considerable time to build momentum. But patient viewers will realize that the intention seems to match the intention of the war itself- a slow progression to a climax, encapsulating a lot about human spirit, sacrifice, and survival.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Gettysburg\" is a remarkably ambitious film that delivers on multiple fronts. If you're a lover of history, drama, or merely seeking an engagingly thoughtful cinematic experience, this film is well worth your time.",
    "\"Mississippi Burning\" is undeniably one of the most powerful and eye-opening films about the African-American Civil Rights movement. The film is based on the true story of the disappearance of three civil rights workers in the summer of 1964, an event that shook the nation and led to stormy uprisings.\n\nThe powerful combination of director Alan Parker and actors Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe is stunning. Hackman delivers an exceptionally strong performance as a former sheriff who uses his keen understanding of Southern mentality to solve the case. Dafoe's portrayal of an idealistic FBI agent is equally compelling, providing the perfect contrast to Hackman's character. The dynamic between them throughout the movie brilliantly reflects the broader national tensions and conflicting attitudes of the time.\n\nAlan Parker's direction is fantastic with a balance of sensitivity and blunt honesty. The nightmarish vision he creates of Mississippi during this gruesome period in history, marked by cross burnings and lynch mobs, is haunting. \n\nFor its cinematography, the film is top-notch. The visual depiction of 1960s Mississippi includes striking images that provide a strong sense of place and time. It complements Parker's storytelling, inscribing the tension and painful struggle of this historical period into the heart of viewers. \n\nYet, the heart of \"Mississippi Burning\" is its moral indignation against racial hatred. The film unflinchingly shows the brutality of the Ku Klux Klan, the complacency of local law enforcement, and the abusive nature of racial segregation. It serves as a potent reminder of the darker corners of American history and the continuous struggle for justice.\n\nHowever, the film has attracted criticism for the liberties it took with the historical events and the under-representation of black characters. Despite these valid concerns, it's crucial to view \"Mississippi Burning\" as a dramatic interpretation rather than a documentary, with the purpose to evoke an emotional response from the audience about a heinous period of American history.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Mississippi Burning\" is a truly riveting film. With its high-octane performances, skillful direction, and intense portrayal of racial prejudice, it beckons the viewer to reflect on a time not so distant in our history. The film does not offer easy answers, but it forces us to confront the uncomfortable questions – the hallmark of meaningful cinema.",

He frames \"Foxcatcher\" in a world of constant unease, displacement and the intangible yearning for acceptance. The pacing of the film might be slower than expected, but the menacing undertone is inescapable, dissecting the tragedy of the human soul's constant pursuit of recognition and worth. \n\nSteve Carell, in the role of the sinister, delusional John DuPont, exhibits a remarkable transformation, imbues a memorable insidiousness that lingers long after the film’s conclusion. Equally noteworthy is Channing Tatum's portrayal of Mark Schultz, through which he offers an unflinching, emotionally intense performance, demonstrating his range as an actor. Mark Ruffalo, as the supportive and sensible Dave Schultz, holds the narrative together with his perseverance.\n\nThe cinematography is stark, imposing and cold, mirroring the emotional isolation each character experiences.

    "\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\" is an amalgam of action, romance, and fantasy all set in the mystical lands of Persia - a concept that triggers excitement. It's a piece adapted from a classic video game, and it definitely fits well into the mold for an entertaining blockbuster hit with its breathtaking visual effects and gripping storyline.\n\nJake Gyllenhall, as Prince Dastan, did a commendable job translating the video game character to the full screen.
