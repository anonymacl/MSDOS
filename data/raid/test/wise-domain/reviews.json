    "Don't be fooled by the title. Make sure you know what you're getting yourself into when you watch this film. Bridge of Spies is literally about the Cold War Bridge of Spies, where Soviet/US spies were exchanged through negotiations. This is nothing like \"The Americans\" (FX TV drama - for some high unrealistic and over-sexualized espionage action - redirect here) and the most action-packed scene you will see is Francis Gary Powers getting shot out of his U2 plane during his mission. <br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is really a historical/legal drama. And based on my preliminary research, they seem to be getting most of their facts right. Obviously a little bit embellished for Hollywood's sake, Bridge of Spies does a fine job as a historical docudrama. There is a lot of talking, but it's meaningful talking. At times, the film can be a little slow {opening scene, especially}, but give it a chance and you might enjoy it. History buffs like myself will definitely enjoy it. But thrill-seekers, you're better off to see the new James Bond movie instead.",
    "For those who don't like documentaries (the documentary about Snowden, which is part of this movie, is excellent education about what our government can do with us) watch this first. Oliver Stone paints a portrait of a stand-up, pretty much button down guy who realizes the work he falls into is anything but what he was taught was right -- and then he needs to find a way out, without endangering his girlfriend. Another great film about a whistleblower --- and for his whistleblowing, he faces far harsher penalties just for coming home. Oliver Stone delivers thought provoking film again, and the entire cast, as well as the writing, is stellar.<br/><br/>For those who made up their mind about Ed Snowden through what was reported in mass media, I would simply say, watch this with an open mind. What happened to him could happen to any of us. This is a cautionary tale based on true facts told in the most exquisite way by Stone and his cast.<br/><br/>Isabeau Vollhardt, author, The Casebook of Elisha Grey",
    "I'm finding it hard to see why this film has taken such a tongue lashing (or keyboard lashing) by some people...<br/><br/>mostly it is said that the main character is selfish and self indulgent, and that this film builds him up to be some kind of hero..<br/><br/>but I think that's missing the point...<br/><br/>through-out I was thinking about how, on one hand it was admirable that he wanted to break from the materialistic, money grabbing oppressive shackles placed on us by modern society, but on the other, how he had gone about it in such an irresponsible, hurtful and self-righteous way...<br/><br/>the way he abandoned his parents and loving sister without a phone call note or explanation, and from the people he met along the way, like the kind old man and young romance, especially compounded this...<br/><br/>and ultimately he realised this at the end by scribbling into a book, \"happiness only real when shared\" surely that is the lesson here! that his selfish, hurtful adolescent behaviour was wrong, and he ultimately paid a terrible cost.<br/><br/>So ignore that haters...they are looking at this story the wrong way! Very much worth an open minded viewing!",
    "As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.<br/><br/>However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.<br/><br/>For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).<br/><br/>The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.<br/><br/>What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.",
    "This third installment is just as long, fixes some of the damages but adds along new ones. At Worlds End improves on its CGI magic but still possesses that dragging story that is just too long and confusing.",
    "When I see films like this, it really underlines the programmed ignorance of most Americans, and just how effective the government and the media are at shaping a false narrative. Al Qaeda was never an existential threat to America, and the Taliban was an internecine problem only to local Afghans and different Islamic sects. The conflict and motivation set up in this film is just ludicrous and phony. I am retired US Army, I still have contacts in the service who know the truth about Afghanistan. This film is a sham.",
    "There is no doubt that THE AVIATOR is the masterpiece of both director Martin Scorsese and actor, Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio becomes Howard Hughes. The actor is so profoundly absorbed in the role that the DiCaprio we know from other films cannot be found in this film. It is a bravura performance of great depth and magnitude. DiCaprio richly deserves his first Academy Award.<br/><br/>I have never know much about Howard Hughes. This film opened my eyes to him as a personality, a businessman, aviator and his lavish lifestyle. DiCaprio no longer is the \"pretty boy\" from other films. The expressions he takes on are not handsome, the deeply furrowed brow, one could actually watch him, as Hughes' character, think his way through challenging situations, the mark of a highly gifted actor. Watching DiCaprio evolve into the paranoid schizophrenic Hughes in the latter part of the film is a stunning example of pure acting. Leo deserves recognition for recreating a most difficult personality.<br/><br/>Though the film is long, it never slows down nor gets boring and it commanded my attention from start to finish. It is masterpiece cinema for these two men and for other actors too. Cate Blanchette must be commended for her role as Katherine Hepburn. Every role was played by first rate actors.<br/><br/>If you want to understand a piece of American history from the 30s through the 1940s, this film will illumine you. It may not be the greatest film ever made but it sure is cinema to the max and worth seeing, without a second thought.",
    "I'm going out on a limb here.  I've just bombed \"Joe Dirt,\" and now I'm going to do an about-face on modern comedies and argue that \"A Night at the Roxbury\" is brilliant.  Most critics didn't see a distinction between these two bombs, but I do.<br/><br/>Comedy oftentimes depends on suffering.  Comic protagonists always take a beating, and we either laugh with them, or at them, or maybe we laugh not at all because we couldn't care less.  The essential question is, are the protagonists of \"A Night at the Roxbury\" lovable losers or just totally annoying dweebs who deserve all the grief they get? <br/><br/>You know my answer already.  I love the Butabi brothers.  They have a strong fraternal bond, they're obsessed with Emilio Estevez, and they can't get any play.  What's not to love?  <br/><br/>Dan Hedaya is great as the brothers' disgruntled dad, and Chazz Palminteri does a hilarious cameo as an entrepreneur obsessed with ass-grabbing. Richard Grieco demonstrates a remarkable sense of humor about himself by allowing the Butabis to build him up as a big celebrity, when the joke is obviously that he's a total has-been.  What a sport, eh?<br/><br/>Nice song, too.  I like this stupid movie.  Really, I do.",
    "More thematically compelling and with better action set-pieces, Toy Story 2 is a sequel that is just as good as the original - and one that isn't afraid to go to the more emotional side of storytelling.",
    "\"The Godfather: Part II\" is a very suspenseful drama with a very exciting story, with great acting and great special effects. I would definitely recommend you watch this movie...but first watch the original classic from 1972 \"The Godfather\" . The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel.",
    "8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.<br/><br/>The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.<br/><br/>The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the \"Free World,\" are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.<br/><br/>Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.<br/><br/>All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.",
    "«We didn't need dialogs, we had faces» said the narcissistic Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in Billy Wilder' \"Sunset Boulevard\", referring to the Silent Era, when she used to be big  before the 'pictures got small'.<br/><br/>The reason of this introduction is that after watching Michel Hazanavicius' critically acclaimed: \"The Artist\", I strongly felt this was the perfect illustration to Norma Desmond's iconic eulogy. From beginning to end, my eyes never ceased to be amazed by the communicative smile of Jean Dujardin as George Valentin, the aging silent movie star and the sparkling eyes of Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller, the young and flamboyant starlet. Their faces occupy the screen with such an electrifying magnetism that they don't just steal the scenes, they steal the dialogs  literally.<br/><br/>I was awestruck by Dujardin's performance. To those who didn't grew up with French TV programs, he's one of the most popular and talented comedians of his generation. Dujardin created the character of Brice de Nice, a blonde surfer whose specialty was to 'diss people', but it was so funny it never sounded mean-spirited. He was a member of a cult comic-troop (who made sketches à la SNL) but even back then, he had a little something that made him special: a voice, a smile, a charisma in both TV and movies, in both dramatic and comedic register. There was no doubt in France that the guy who was famous for his impressions of Robert De Niro and the camel (and even De Niro doing the camel) was promised to a brilliant career.<br/><br/>Look closely at Jean Dujardin's face, it's like drawn with 'classic' features: the finely traced mustache who builds a Fairbanks-like charisma like the strength from Samson's hair, the dazzling smile making him look like the lost son of Gene Kelly, and a certain macho toughness reminding of a young Sean Connery. Dujardin's face is a gift from cinematic Gods, and \"The Artist\" finally lets it glide, earning him the Cannes Festival Award for Best Actor. I sincerely believe he deserves an Oscar nomination, because he just doesn't play an actor from the Silent Era, he embodies the Era with the same level of demented craziness as Norma Desmond, in a brighter and more light-hearted side.<br/><br/>Valentin's self-absorption echoes Desmond's cynical ego while his gaudy 'Don Lockwood' mask (Gene Kelly in \"Singin' in the Rain\") hides the more poignant face of his insecurity. He's the star of the screen because only the screen allows him to express his unique talent. While Lockwood had to adapt to the 'talking' revolution, George Valentin makes a conservative U Turn starting an inexorable descent into madness, from an outcast, to a has-been until being finally alienated by his own talkie-phobia. The direction is so clever that it challenges many times our perceptions, creating unexpected feelings of discomfort when real sounds are heard. But I was surprised to see how much it worked on a dramatic level.<br/><br/>And this is the strength of the film, although I expect it to discomfort some viewers: it isn't a tribute in the literary meaning of the word. It has its moments where it tricks us into the use of sounds or dialogs, but never fails to distract us from the core of the story: the romance. Very quickly, we forget about spotting the hints, the references to silent classics: chase scenes, over-the-top comical gesticulations, slapstick jokes etc. This mindset would disappoint those who expected a film with the same material as Mel Brook's \"Silent Movie\", which was clearly a tribute. \"The Artist\" IS a silent movie, featuring a beautiful romance between George and Peppy, who got her break with an idea from George, something that would make her different from the other actresses: a beauty spot above the upper lip. A clever credit-billing montage depicts her consequent ascension to stardom until she finally dethrones George and makes a has-been out of him.<br/><br/>If I mentioned the performance of Dujardin, Berenice Bejo also deserves some accolades because she succeeded in looking so \"old\" from our POV yet so fresh and modern in the film, with the appealing feel-good and optimistic attitude she constantly brings on screen. With her doll-face and youngish smile, she's like a cute little girl enjoying what she does. In a way, Peppy Miller embodies the film's most inspirational element: a positive message about passion and enjoyment. And this indirectly highlights George's source of troubles: being deprived from what he enjoyed the most and suffering from his progressive fading into oblivion. Along with this conflict, the evolution of George and Peppy's romance never feels forced, quite an accomplishment when we consider how slightly over-the-top silent movie stars used to act.<br/><br/>Both Dujardin and Bejo are indeed powerful in an Oscar-worthy level and at that moment, I can't continue without mentioning the third character of the film, George's dog. The relationship between George and the dog provides a sort of Chaplinesque feel to the movie, a mix of tenderness and poignancy, so natural and convincing I wonder if the Academy will think of a honorary Oscar. Anyway, I applaud Hazanivicius for not having reduced \"The Artist\" to a flashy spectacle with no substance, with the word 'homage' as the director's convenient alibi, and make a touching romance about two people who met each other at a pivotal time in the history of film-making, each representing a side of cinema, the old-school silent generation: Chaplin, Keaton, Pickford and the exuberant talkers: Grant, Hepburn, Davis  And I'm glad he found the true note to reconcile between these two universes at the end  didn't I tell you Dujardin was the lost son of Gene Kelly?<br/><br/>\"The Artist\" plays like a missing link between \"Singin' in the Rain\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\" and it's indeed one of the best films of 2011, with the absence of words as an endearing 'beauty spot'.",
    "Don't believe the negative reviews on this one. Its easily the most underrated movie I have come across, and can best be described as a hidden gem for the ones who like historical adventure/action-movies (Braveheart/Gladiator/Kingdom of Heaven/Robin Hood) and fantasy-movies. <br/><br/>Others have described it better here on IMDb, so I am just going to say this: It is not a historical correct piece, and do not try to be. It should be viewed as a fantasy, even though the vikings portrayed and their buildings/settlement is the most realistic I have seen in any movie to date.<br/><br/>Btw: To all you who like the above-mentioned movies for the big battle-scenes and sword-fighting, don't expect this one to have its major impact in that area (even though it got them). On the other hand this movie portrays a much more realistic take on fighting in pre-medieval times. Instead of having the one super-hero defying all logic, you get a band of fighting comrades which together becomes a fierce force. There is a fantastic cast in this movie, with Banderas, Storhøi and Kulich making their characters come truly alive.<br/><br/>This is a great adventure of a movie, which should be regarded alongside the other movies I mentioned above.<br/><br/>9/10 - Must see for all who like adventure/fantasy",
    "***May contain Spoilers***<br/><br/>I was embarrassed as an American seeing this film. Just knowing that it would be seen over seas. It's amazing how a submarine can withstand 40 depth charges while another could be put out by two. And I believe it would also be a virtual impossibility for Americans to commandeer a German sub and vice versa.<br/><br/>But the worst thing about this movie is its arrogant rewriting of history. It was the British who first captured the enigma machine NOT the Americans. We have no right to take credit for other nations accomplishments. Hollywood simply has a historical ignorance. But beyond that it is still just an awful, awful movie. No one with half a brain would be entertained by this garbage.",
    "I know its gonna sound bloody insane,but for me(no critics,as an average human being like you) it was the best Hindi romantic movie i've ever seen.<br/><br/>Nice chemistry between Shahrukh & Anushka(I'm their fan :P ),plaudits for Aditya chopra for this masterpiece,amazing music & Cinematography.Some questions will rise,how someone can't recognize her own husband without mustache,and some silly others.But the fact is i don't know how,but somehow this movie just touch your heart deeply,i mean u have to..u have to smile and cry in the meantime while watching this movie....for not only me,my friends and companions,almost 90% were having same feeling.credit goes to the whole team for this kind of creation.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and reading this review.hope,u would be kind enough to forget if i made any mistake.Stay blessed :)",
    "I teach a college course on WWII, in graduate school studied under several experts on the subject and have interviewed numerous survivors on both sides. This film comes out on top, perhaps the finest ever made on the subject of the war (though the Belorussian \"Come and See\" & \"Schindler's List\" are darn close as well).<br/><br/>I had the remarkable experience of watching this film last night with two veterans, one a GI who fought from Omaha to Czechoslovakia. . .and a German infantry officer, a veteran of four years on the Eastern Front. The German, who met Hitler several times, within minutes was exclaiming over the historical accuracy, right down to \"Hitler's\" lower class Munich accent. . .something an American audience would never pick up on. My German friend, who at the end of the war was in East Prussia, in the debacle of attempting to evacuate over a million civilians ahead of the Russians, was profoundly shaken by the film. . .saying the horror, the hospital scenes, the utter chaos, the lynchings, the sight of 12 year old children fighting. . .all of it was real. And an interesting observation by him. . .he had no idea Berlin, at the end, had been as bad as what he witnessed along the Baltic coast and is still haunted by. It truly was \"Gotterdammerung\" for an entire nation and this film brings it frightfully close to you. If you are a parent of small children, the terrifying ending for the Goebbel's children is an absolutely searing nightmare.<br/><br/>I think the most important point of the film was the portrayal of Hitler. . .not as the stereotyped raving madman, usually overplayed like a bad performance of King Richard, but far more subtle. I've talked with many who knew Hitler, including a childhood playmate of Helga, Goebbel's oldest child, and all will tell you that Hitler could be absolutely charming, focused on you, even courtly when with women. The terror is, that even as the actor shows us that \"human\" side, in his soft voice he is dictating orders, observations, and comments of absolute evil. The true form of evil rarely looks evil on the surface, it seduces us with a fair face as it leads, sometimes an entire nation, into damnation. THis film captured that evil.<br/><br/>My German friend's comment at the end of the movie. . .\"I still can not believe we fought for that monster for six years.\" <br/><br/>A history professor at Montreat College",
    "Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney.  That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist.  He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br/><br/>But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.  Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself.  Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!  Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.",
    "The film is just over 2 hours long, but when it was over it seemed like I had been in the cinema about 30 minutes. <br/><br/>The film centres on the battle for the 1976 Formula 1 World Championship, and the rivalry between the Austrian \"professor\" Nikki Lauda and the British playboy James Hunt. <br/><br/>The two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off-track. This bit of artistic licence does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. <br/><br/>The film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life. <br/><br/>The two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I'm not sure if this is further artistic licence. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred. <br/><br/>After that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail – although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then – and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash). <br/><br/>We are then taken to 1976 and that titanic struggle for the World Crown. Only one real issue here – the British Grand Prix result, but I suspect this was simplified in the interests of time. <br/><br/>The casting is superb. Chris Hemsworth, an Aussie, does an excellent job on public schoolboy James Hunt, while Daniel Bruhl both sounds and looks frighteningly like the Austrian. There is little room for a supporting cast amongst the drivers which is a shame – only Clay Regazzoni has a part of any real substance. Peterson, Watson, Depailler, Scheckter, Andretti et al could have featured a little more I think. What did their contemporaries think of the two protagonists? The supporting cast is mainly required for Hunt – Lord Hesketh, \"Bubbles\" Horsley and Teddy Mayer / Tyler Alexander of McLaren, while the Ferrari team principals are rarely seen. <br/><br/>The love angle is perfectly catered for by Olivia Wilde (Hunt's first wife Suzy) and the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara - of Downfall fame – as the future Marlene Lauda. Both give quality performances. <br/><br/>The attention to detail is superb. Although the tracks are not the actual ones (for understandable reasons) the cars, the helmets, the sponsors are all authentic. The film \"feels\" like it's happening in the 70's. <br/><br/>For anyone interested in great personal stories, F1, the 70's, cars or just like to see a great film, then Rush is for you.",
    "It's true that you can have too much of a good thing...please no more different editions!<br/><br/>THEATRICAL CUT - was the best version of any of the \"cuts\" it was the most cleanly edited and it had the best soundtrack out of the three. It is clear after seeing all the versions of the film that they tested all of the jokes and the ones included were cherry picked, and the best were picked to be included in this one.<br/><br/>SUPER DUPER CUT/EXTENDED - this was supposed to be an extended version of the film but it was actually a different cut...what I mean by that is that they changed the soundtrack and they cut out what I considered to be some of the funniest jokes from the theatrical cut and replaced them. They ALSO added some additional footage to the film after making those changes. This version of the film feels darker and less funny to me personally so I prefer the theatrical cut over it.<br/><br/>ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL/PG13 - This is the edition that nobody asked for and is the most unnecessary. From an editing standpoint this version of film is very sloppy, and seems like one giant montage. They don't even start this version of the film out at the beginning it jumps right into the \"safe room scene\". A lot of the footage included in this edition was already available on the home releases and online (apart from the short amount filmed with Fred Savage). The movie would end up edited on TV regardless of this edition existing or not. So in reality there was no need for this edition to exist apart from making more money.",
    "Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. \"When you re-write a script it gets better and better\" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like \"Nick of Time\" \"The Astronaut's Wife\" and \"Secret Window\" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a \"safe\", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!",
    "I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\".",
    "Or he would know that the rebels won in Episode VI!<br/><br/>This is the Worst Star Wars-related show so far<br/><br/>I hate every scene of this reboot, there is always a joke, it does bore even if it says \"Star Wars.\" This remake is the reason why I don't drive to the cinemaanymore, it reflects the era very well unfortunately. I hope they cancel Star Wars and let it recover from the emarassment for years.",
    "Reading the back cover of the DVD and seeing that Colin Firth and Ben Kingsley are given top billing, I expected an intelligent King Arthur story. Well, it really wasn't either, although I did find it entertaining. I must not have read the description carefully enough. No matter; overall, it was fun but just a little too silly. I'm beginning to wonder about the discernment of some of these actors, how they can play such intelligent roles for a film or two and then revert to something like this.<br/><br/>Anyway, the story is really a Roman empire one, not a King Arthur story. We only see the tie-in to the later in the last few minutes of the film, in the epilogue. This action story is all about the last Caesar, a small boy, and the last legion that fought as Rome had now been taken over by the Goths. The Roman Empire had come to an end.<br/><br/>Mixed in with that tale was the famous \"excalibur\" sword. We see the origins of that and how it eventually got into the hands of King Arthur. But, once again, that is only explained in the final minutes. However, the sword is used by the good Roman general who protects the last Caesar from the Goths, who want him imprisoned for life, or killed.<br/><br/>What made the story interesting, at least for me, was the chase-scene type atmosphere of a small band of heroes protecting a little boy, fleeing the bloodthirsty Goths until they could mount some sort of counter-attack in the north in Brittania. That, and the pretty computer-generated scenery and action stunts, kept it interesting. However, don't look for credibility in those action scenes and expect the typical political-correctness of today (i.e. where a woman beats up hundreds of men and the good guys of all colors prevail despite ridiculous odds).<br/><br/>Some parts of this will leave you shaking your head in disbelief. You will feel you're watching a kids' film at times. However, if you want an hour-and-a-half of decent escapist fare, and can put your brain on hold for that time, it fits the bill and will at least entertain you.",
    "David Cronenberg redefined what we think of as creepy with this brilliant film. The makeup special effects and grossouts are top notch, but what is most surprising about The Fly is that it turns out to be a very well acted and emotional love story. It greatly surpasses the original '58 version.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the relationship between Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis at the top and once it takes its turn towards horror it really pays off. It's not just scary, it's a tragedy too. Jeff Goldblum is phenomenal. He is mesmerizing as he delivers great dialogue and once he's barely recognizable he still breaks through the makeup and you can feel the human inside. I can't believe he didn't get an Oscar for this, it's easily his best performance. <br/><br/>I can't express how much I love The Fly. It's more than just horror, and it's proof that you just may find a truly great movie where you least expect it. <br/><br/>My rating: 10/10",
    "I am an engineer working offshore in North Sea. I have seen the movie this evening in UK. Is really a good movie, congratulations to all involved you done a great job showing a little bit of ''life in offshore rig''. Looks like in this movie is BP fault but in real world at the rig site everyone has the right to STOP THE JOB if something is wrong or something is going on against the procedures. I have work before in BP rigs in North Sea and I stop the job when I wasn't happy with what is going on I had all the support from the Service Company that I am working for and also BP company understood my concerns. If you are a engineer, roughneck, derrick-man or whatever you are at Rig Site if you think that something is going wrong and against the procedures STOP THE JOB. I do it and I will do again better to lose my job than to see people dying.(Thanks for reading my review)",
    "This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.",
    "I went into this movie confident that it would be a cheesy, campy romp with the same \"tried and true tricks of the trade,\" like when the hero is investigating the creepy music coming from the basement and a cat jumps into frame, but I quickly discovered that this would not be case with Insidious. After watching the move and obsessing on it for about 12 hours now, I can honestly say it's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. In fact, there were several points during the film where I screamed like a 13-year old girl at a Justin Beiber concert. Keep in mind I was consciously trying my hardest to keep my composure, mainly because I was sitting beside my new girlfriend of 2 months. She, incidentally, didn't make a peep; thankfully, I later found out she had her eyes closed the whole time. <br/><br/>I was also expecting to see some blood and guts, especially coming from the guys who made Saw, but there wasn't a drop. Instead, they used just about everything else in their arsenal to scare the bejesus out of me and everyone else in the theater (my girlfriend included). From literally the opening credits, they created an intense, haunting tension that didn't leave my body till several whiskeys and half a Xanax later. And the movie constantly feeds that tension, making even the characters' mundane family life somehow seem utterly terrifying. I was actually exhausted leaving the theater from all of the uncomfortable squirming I was unable to control. I'd say it's the most calories I've ever burned while watching a movie (well, at least a PG-13 movie). <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was great. It was crazy scary, thoroughly entertaining, and even surprisingly funny at times. Having said that, it will be quite some time before I watch another horror movie; I have no desire to be turned into a frazzled bundle of nerves again anytime soon. So, if you plan on seeing this movie, please consider this a cautionary reminder: it's probably best to go with someone who's already witnessed you have a complete physical and mental breakdown, so as to avoid an embarrassing drive home. And maybe bring a Xanax as well.",
    "I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.<br/><br/>10/10 Highly Recommended",
    "When I first saw 'Ben Hur' I was 8 years old and hadn't seen many films, since we were hardly ever allowed to watch television. Imagine what an impact this film had on me (my movie diet had so far consisted of Chaplin and Disney films - which, of course, is not at all a bad thing).<br/><br/>The experience was simply mesmerizing. Awe and wonder filled me as I watched this story of shocking betrayal, revenge and forgiveness unfold on screen - and by the time the heart-stopping chariot race was over, my fate as a future movie addict was sealed. <br/><br/>Despite its 212 minutes running time, this is storytelling at its finest that knows how to entertain; as we follow Judah Ben-Hur's dramatic journey from Jerusalem to Rome and back again, the film just never lets up and immerses you completely.<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine anything more cinematic, especially at the time: if ever there was an epic that was meant to be seen on the big screen in all its bombastic glory, it's Ben Hur. And even now, after I've seen the film many, many times, I feel like this story has a certain sense of greatness to it that is touching (and I don't mean that in a religious sense).<br/><br/>My verdict: this film was and is nothing like the many \"sandal and sword\" or bible films of that era; it is (at least to me) the ultimate film epic. With its touching story and fantastic action sequences - which I think hold up amazingly well - Ben Hur is among the milestones of its era and part of film history.<br/><br/>Pure cinema and a must see. 10 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",
    "`National Lampoon's Animal House' may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the `Saturday Night Live' generation, but it could be argued that `Caddyshack,' directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire `SNL genre,' of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative. The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and `kiss up' a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him `The world needs ditch diggers, too.'  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.<br/><br/>And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like `Be the Ball,' and `A donut with no hole is a danish,' may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as `Freddy Got Fingered,' and `Road Trip.'  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.<br/><br/>Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world. But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.<br/><br/>Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.<br/><br/>The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the `Cinderella Boy' on the course at Atlanta. This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.<br/><br/>O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.<br/><br/>Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And `Caddyshack' is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",
    "So a few weeks ago, my sister and I decided to watch a movie and wanted to see Titanic again, so of course we get to the sad ending where Jack dies, but Rose lived on to have an incredible life, I asked my sister \"I wonder what would've happened if Jack lived? Would he and Rose really have lasted like they thought they would have?\", she giggled and asked if I saw Revolutionary Road, I said no and she said to see this movie and my question would be answered. So here's something I never thought I would say, especially in 1997, thank God Jack died! OK, sorry for the lousy introduction, I always like to say how I saw the movie. But I didn't just want to see Revolutionary Road because of the reunion between the extremely talented Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, but also one of my favorite directors of all time Sam Mendes(American Beauty) who took on this project in the new telling of what the American Dream is and maybe it's not always what we had expected it to be.<br/><br/>Frank and April Wheeler moved to Revolutionary Road in one of New York City's wealthy Connecticut suburbs, and have a daughter and a son in hopes of living the American dream. But April is dissatisfied with her life as a suburban housewife, and Frank despises his marketing job at Knox Business Machines, where his father worked for twenty years in a similar position. They feel that they are unique and special, but trapped in the conformity of life in the suburbs, where they moved to raise their children. On Frank's birthday April surprises him with a birthday cake and a proposal that they move to Paris, with April working as a secretary to support the family so that Frank can discover what he truly wants to do in life. Frank is reluctant at first but ultimately embraces the idea, and the renewed optimism breathes fresh life into their relationship. Meanwhile, April becomes pregnant again, she wants an abortion and has bought a device she has heard is safe if used in the first twelve weeks. Frank disapproves. Later, Frank is offered a promotion and raise at work. Eventually he tells April that for the sake of the unborn baby he has decided not to go to Paris. Extremely unhappy, April starts to go crazy and screams her hatred for Frank as he still tries to continue to make the \"perfect and comfortable\" life for her.<br/><br/>This movie was really amazing, it's one of the most over looked Oscar wise from 2008, both Kate and Leonardo pull in heart wrenching performances. The thing about their characters is that I saw so much of my parents in them, they had all these amazing dreams together, were so in love, but then discover that life jumps in the front seat to what they really wanted to do. Kate's character, April, is receiving a lot of hate, but honestly I couldn't hate her, how could you? Yes, she said some awful things, but when it came down to it, she just wanted the man she fell in love with back again, she wanted to feel alive. The problem was both her and Frank were trying to run away from their problems, then Frank got comfortable; honestly, who knows what would have fixed their problems? But I do recommend Revolutionary Road, I really thought it's a small masterpiece and will get more recognition in the future I hope.<br/><br/>10/10",
    "When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...",
    "So its fluffy and predictable. It's unrealistic and sickly sweet. Who cares...this film pretends to be nothing more than what it is intended to be. Light romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Since stars like Cary Grant, Kathrine Hepburn and Irene Dunne, lit up our cinema screens in the 1930's with films like The Awful Truth, Bringing up Baby and My Favorite Wife, Hollywood and of course the movie going public have reserved a special place in their hearts for RomComs, screwballs and battle of the sexes comedies.<br/><br/>Identical plots, Identical jokes but none the less jokes and plots that will never go out of style and will always be relevant in any age or location, whether it be New York of the 30's or New York in the present day.<br/><br/>Hollywood has always worked on the basis that they stick to what has been tried and tested and has proved to work, that is why with a small plot change and a rehash of old jokes and situations they are able to reinvent their movies for a new generation of film buffs. It was through this formula that Doris Day and friends were able to continue RomCom history throughout the 60's and every one of them box office winners.<br/><br/>A recent example of this would be Down With Love starring Ewan McGregor and Rene Zelwegger. Who could not see plot comparisons to Pillow Talk or Lover Come Back? Yet it did not make this film any less enjoyable. Our entertainment lies in seeing our actors of the day fill the roles of the great actors of yesterday and how the scripts and jokes are adapted and told within a backdrop of 21st century life etc.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson made this film with impeccable comic timing and enjoyable performances. Of course with Goldie Hawn for a mother, Hudson comes straight from comic stock so I would have been disappointed if she failed to meet the challenge but she didn't. Some of her facial expressions and mannerisms almost had me convinced I was watching an old episode of \"Laugh In\" <br/><br/>McConaughey also held his own and proved himself to be a gifted comic as he did in the Wedding Planner.<br/><br/>This plot seemed quite original and as a battle of the sexes comedy, they seldom come as good as this. Again the formula was followed and we were under no illusion on what the final outcome would be, but their journey to this ultimate destination is what we find entertaining.<br/><br/>This type of film has been popular for seventy plus years and their simularities are what makes them so. Instead of slamming them..watch some of the predecessors and appreciate their origins.<br/><br/>Be thankful they are still making these types of movies today as in an era which is threatening to be devoured by action thrillers, fantasy adventure and shoot 'em ups this seems to be the only diversity left in motion pictures.",
    "The Last Emperor is a truly larger than life film telling us about a life of a human, but not just any human, the Emperor himself. He's also not your normal emperor, he's the Last Emperor of China, his name is Pu Yi. He lives his life however he wants to and he sort has a larger than life persona. In just his late 20s, he stood at the throne ruling over one of the largest nations on Earth, with the most people on Earth. He controls and commands the lives of nearly Five-Hundred Million people. Throughout his abdication, his decline and dissolute lifestyle; his exploitation by the invading Japanese, and finally to his obscure existence as just another peasant worker in the People's Republic.<br/><br/>While the film isn't perfect, it is certainly beautiful and a visual treat for anyone. Bernardo Bertolucci's cinematic biography of Emperor Pu Yi is an emotional, beautiful and astonishing film... And it's a massive production which won 9 Oscars, It deserved every single one of them. The film will always be remembered for its size and its beauty. This Asian Masterpiece tells us a story of not only an Emperor, but of a country, which was and still is the largest nation in the world. The Last Emperor is certainly one the Largest, most beautiful films ever created in Cinema.<br/><br/>A Monumental Achievement. ~10/10~",
    "I had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at IMDb and that's why I had avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and as I had nothing better to do... and as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised by how I was affected watching it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter.<br/><br/>I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you have heard about it.",
    "One of the best romance movies I have ever seen and one of my favorite movies that I have ever seen. I loved the book and I loved the movie even more. The writing, plot, story, and screenplay were fantastic. Shaileen Woodley and Ansel Elgort's performances in the film as Hazel and Augustus were spectacular. The Fault in Our Stars is gorgeous, funny and sad at the same time and it shows true love can be found no matter what. Loved it so much.",
    "An earlier reviewer compared this to the Japanese cult favorite Battle Royale and decided it was almost junk. I beg to differ - the film needs to be evaluated on its own merits and its own story. Battle Royale is a single story about merciless, wanton and senseless violence and depravity when the aim was simply to be the last to survive - a kill- fest, where the innovative ways of killing serve to shock and titillate the audience but do little for the plot. The Hunger Games however, is about oppression, fighting back and revolution. The Games, though pivotal, are still part of a larger story.<br/><br/>Compared to the first film, this one is definitely darker. The characters look even more despondent than ever, and if you thought there were few laughs in the first film, there is practically none in this. Even the brightly-lit scenes featuring cheering crowds and smiling hosts seemed dim, bleak and depressing. While enjoying the witty banter, you couldn't help but wait for the 'but...'. The feeling of doom and gloom persists from the start to the end of the film. It is not a bad thing though - it is not supposed to be a happy movie.<br/><br/>Many details and subplots were understandably cut from the film adaptation, but none that were critical to the plot of the film. However, a lot of the peripheral action that were in the book is missing here, hence, though the story moves quickly enough, there is always the feeling that for an action-thriller, there aren't enough fights or explosions. The ones they movie do have aren't exciting or grand enough.<br/><br/>But in terms of story-telling, the movie still works to move from the first film and prepare for the third. The seeds of revolution have been planted and watered, and we now prepare for the maturing and harvesting.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence didn't do as well here as in the last film, probably because most of the growing needed has been done previously. Josh Hutcherson though, put in a better performance. While he may previously be the injured lovestruck puppy dog, his maturing into a more complex character in this movie means he starts carrying more of the film.<br/><br/>Emotionally, this movie affected me less than the last one. Maybe it's partly because I know what is coming, but that accounts for a very minor percentage. Mostly it's because the film is unable to engage your baser emotions - nothing that truly tugs at your heartstrings. The pervading gloom also seems to have sapped any ability to feel more despondent than you think you already are.<br/><br/>It is still a movie that can be enjoyed though, and I did enjoy it enough. Hopefully the next film will provide for more emotional variance. If you don't feel for the characters, you won't care about the film.",
    "I would consider myself to be a movie buff and I live and grew up in Massachusetts. I must tell you that Ben Affleck has done an outstanding job in his directorial debut. In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break. No. He is the absolute perfect person to play this role. Because they know the area they have made one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. And it's not just some Boston movie either. I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not, it's much better and the fact is, I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life. The woman who plays the girl's mother, I don't know who see is, but I've met her about 1000 times.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes I'd never spoil it for you but it's complex, not confusing. There is a lot going on and it's so real. I don't know what's happened in this area but people have become so lousy. So lousy that if you're a good person you just don't know what can be done anymore. There seems to be no answer sometimes and this film is set in that world. If you have the brains and heart to try you don't even know what will come of it.<br/><br/>Who should see this? Intelligent people. People who want to come out of a movie thinking about what they just saw. People who want to see an incredibly well made film. And anyone who ever liked Ben Affleck even for half a second. He should be very proud of this movie. As far as content there are loads of curse words, some drug use, but no nudity that I can remember, and there is some gun violence, but nothing too bad. Put it high on your movie going list.",
    "I don't understand the hate for this movie it actually surprised me, I really enjoyed this film. Captain America: Civil War is a descent awesome MCU super action the third film of the Captain America trilogy. To me the second movie Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still the best one I just love that movie to death, but I like this one I love the first one but I just love all three of Captain America films. I thought the cast did a good job Chris Evens kicks ass once again he is Captain America and I look this movie from his point of view. He is really become my favorite hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Avengers films especially Age of Ultron, Captain America is still a guy who has a lot of screen time that it is the focus of a movie and he is still the guy I can take a side I agree with him, I can understand his choices.<br/><br/>We have also almost everyone from Avengers films except Thor and Hulk actors Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo did not appear. Chris Hemsworth thought that MCU fired him because he was not cast as Thor but he was later explained that MCU wants his own movie and his own stand alone path which I can't wait for Thor: Ragnarok.<br/><br/>The cast beside Chris Evens includes Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl.<br/><br/>In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions-one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. We have two opposite teams now fighting each other: <br/><br/>Team Iron Man: War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, The Vision, Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Team Captain America: Hawkeye, Sharon Carter, Falcon, Bucky Barnes, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch.<br/><br/>The battle between Captain America and Iron Man draws a political line in the sand. On one side, you have Tony Stark, a man looking to protect the world from super-powered individuals who've proved in the past to be more destructive than helpful. On the other, you have Steve Rogers championing civil liberties. It's the age old debate of safety coming at the cost of freedom, and we'll get to see it play out to a hopefully satisfying conclusion this year.<br/><br/>The action scenes are fantastic, the fight scenes on the airport are incredible heart pulse breath taking awesome. The fight scenes were very well done and well choreographed. I liked this movie more the story drew me in, the villain wasn't that good.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. does a good job, Paul Rudd he is fun in the flick, he has a great moment as Ant-Man he has a few moments but one predictable. Scarlett Johansson did great! Black Widow kicked ass specially in the beginning of the flick. Anthony Mackie I really like him as Falcon he as a lot of good stuff in this. He was down played in Age of Ultron but has a lot screen time in here which was excellent and they made that for that in this one I am glad for it. Anthony Mackie has a lot of good screen time, specially in the action moments. Falcon has a remote control like a mini Flacon I thought that was really cool. Chris Evens is to root for this character, Black Panther interesting the actor playing black panther was really good I like him and I am really interested seeing his up coming movie. Bucky Barnes: Winter Soldier did fine.<br/><br/>A lot of people are complain about how terrible this movie is I am sorry I don't see it that way, I don't see at all it is peace of sh**. I wish that Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow / Crossbones wouldn't die and it was nice to see him in the beginning of the movie. I still wish he would work for the villain I still enjoy his screen time.<br/><br/>I thought Chris Evens and Robert Downey Jr, did work great as a opposite team. I love the end of fighting between Cap, Iron Man and Bucky Barnes. I thought the last fight scene was well choreographed I honestly think Iron Man would have won and he would killed Bucky Barnes. If Cap wouldn't have hurt his heart. I know when Tony find out Bucky killed his parents and he killed his mom in 1991 he decide to kill him. I mourn with Tony and it was a great dialogue \"That shield doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve it! My father made that shield!\" <br/><br/>Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.<br/><br/>I understand the hate, because Captain turn the law politics back to save his friend, but he actually try to safe an innocent man who was framed by Zemo. <br/><br/>Captain America Civil War WAS BETTER THAN X-MEN APOCALYPSE, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Man of Steel and Deadpool I don't like those movies they are peace of sh** and too way overrated. The rating I am giving is 10/10",
    "Despite the fact that this film is a totally unoriginal and predictable retread of a dozen `losers to winners' sports stories, it is so hysterically funny that I didn't even care.  The story is thin at best.  The NFL is having a players strike and scabs are called in to finish the season.  Our heroes are low on ability but high on desire and peculiarity.  The quarterback, Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), once had a promising career, but he fell apart psychologically when his team was pummelled in a college bowl game and he was labelled a player that folds in the big game.  Of course, while visiting the NFL, Shane falls in love with the head cheerleader (Brooke Langton) who never dates players (except of course this once).<br/><br/>All this is merely a mundane excuse for a raucous and silly comedy that has some sidesplitting moments.  To enjoy this film you really need two things. You need to love football and you need to enjoy slapstick, banana peel comedy.  I realize that this limits the audience considerably, but for those who qualify (and I am one), this movie is a scream.<br/><br/>Director Howard Deutch (Pretty in Pink, Grumpier Old Men) did a great job on the football sequences.  He hired 45 professional football players (Former NFL players, Canadian Football League, etc.) to do the football scenes and sent the actors to a three-week football camp.  The action looked real because it was real.  The players were told to play and hit the way they normally would.  Of course, the plays were choreographed, but they were real football plays.<br/><br/>The comedy was lowbrow, outrageous and crass, with a great deal of physical comedy.  The cheerleader scenes were a riot, especially the cheerleader tryouts.  The scene where they started pantomiming sex acts to distract the opposing team was priceless.  There was also sharp-witted football humor that required more than just a passing knowledge of the game.<br/><br/>There isn't much serious that can be said about the acting.  Keanu Reeves tried to play an earnest comeback and romantic role amidst all the foolishness and it really didn't fit with the rest of the film.  However, he was an excellent athlete.  He did most of his own on-field shots and looked very believable as the quarterback.  Gene Hackman was good when he was making snappy wisecracks, but his inspirational `Hoosiers' imitation was misplaced.<br/><br/>This film really belonged to the supporting actors like Orlando Jones (Clifford Franklin), Michael Taliferro and Faizon Love (The Jackson Twins), Ace Yonamine (Jumbo Fumiko), Rhys Ifans (Nigel `The Leg' Gruff) and all the cheerleaders who made the comedy work.  Jon Favreau gets a special mention as the crazy S.W.A.T. officer turned linebacker who took the wild man role to the next level.<br/><br/>This film won't be fun for everyone, but it will have certain people falling off their chairs.  I rated it an 8/10.  Subtract two points if you aren't amused by slapstick and boorish behavior, and another two if you aren't a football fan.  For the rest of you, be prepared to split a gut.",
    "Where would the animation world be without the humongous success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?  If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland.  Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project.  Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.<br/><br/>There must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint.  The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy.  In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).<br/><br/>In my opinion, the story was great but not perfect.  It's not as exciting or filled with as much witty remarks as today's animated features, but as soon as the dwarfs are introduced, the movie takes on an endearing lighter side. For the record, my favorite dwarf is Doc, because I can relate to him being a strong leader with some very humanistic follies, such as always getting tongue-tied (I do that myself all too often).  All the songs stand out in their own way.  `Some Day My Prince Will Come' is a classic, fairy-tale ballad.  `Heigh-Ho,' `Dig, Dig, Dig,' and `Whistle While You Work' are great songs to pick up your spirits when you have to go to work, do chores, or do homework.  And my favorite, `The Silly Song,' is just a great, catchy, and funny song.  As for the imagery, it's just breathtaking, especially considering how early it was introduced.  The colors are rich and lively, and the multi-plane camera does add some great depth to the movie.<br/><br/>As you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world.  Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.<br/><br/>My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)",
    "I must admit, the trailers didn't have me convinced - and after the sour taste 'Jack the Giant Slayer' left in my mouth, I was sceptic. I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.<br/><br/>It's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense. Because this is the kind of film that made me fall in love with movies in the first place.<br/><br/>Yet (despite my 10-star review), it's not perfect. And it's not 'The Usual Suspects' with mutants - how could it be; this is simply not that kind of film. But I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters – but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot – and also the most interesting. Different time-lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last instalment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves). <br/><br/>What really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations – at least as far as I'm concerned – is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists – what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no-holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie).<br/><br/>So my verdict: If you like to get your minds blown by something with true heart and soul, this massive 'mutant' of a film is upon you, and all you have to do is give in to the X-citement. Enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/",
    "\"Absolutely magnificent, Dhoni,finishes off in-style, A magnificent stroke into the crowd! India lift the world cup, After 28 years , The party started in the dressing room. and, Its an Indian captain who's been absolutely magnificent in the night of the final.\" Pretty much one of the best moments of the movie. Massive goosebumps. Ms Dhoni The Untold Story - Is a fantastically made movie which is like two sides of the same coin. The first half which shows why Neeraj Pandey is one of the best directors in the country. While the second half shows why Neeraj Pandey should never make a love story. The movie's main strength is clearly Sushant Singh Rajput who shines in every scene. He has captured the essence of the calm and composed Dhoni and portrayed it brilliantly. The first of the movie is stunning, brilliantly acted, poor special effects with some great dialogues and excellent direction by Neeraj Pandey. The cricketing aspect of Dhoni is so well done. It shows that there is always a team behind a person who is successful. An ode to friendship, struggles, responsibility, compromise and facing life regardless of the unexpected turns and twists. I was in awe how well connected the movie was. Moving from one point to another so effortlessly. Neeraj Pandey's best hour in cinema. The second half starts of well but the two love stories really bring down the movie. The Actresses are likable and all. WTF Neeraj Pandey but the movie moved at a steady pace nevertheless. It was like living the past. The famous India-Pakistan series where Dhoni shines. A lot of moments. It was like a Pleasant flashback. The performances in the movie are brilliant. Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni. What a performance! Not his best, I feel Kai Po Che was better. He was seamless, cool, composed, confident. Just like MSD. He breaks down in one scene. Which was brilliant. The Supporting Star Cast is brilliant.Every Actor in the supporting role. FANTASTIC!!! They are a lot of them. Everyone was brilliant. The actresses were strictly average. The music was decent. The movie is a solid 8-8.5/10. The love angles and the bad special effects in the first half are the only things which could have been improved. You'll love it if you loved cricket. You'll like it if you love good cinema.",
    "Well, if I could split the movie into two, I would say that the first half is a superb Proposal and the second half is fairly traditional Hollywood pablum. In the first half, the wonderful comedic timing and chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds was terrific. The writing was first-rate intellectual, snappy sparring, even throwing in some literary references in the put-downs. Kudos to the Director, Anne Fletcher, and the Screenwriter, Pete Chiarelli.<br/><br/>The completely different tone in the second half, I surmise, could only be attributed to the studios/producers stepping in and stating that the film must appeal to a wider audience. We, then, get lots of family characters thrown in, with a great reduction of Bullock and Reynolds mutual screen time. And when they do share time in the second half, it's more about slapstick/physical humor (cue studios/producers needing appeal to wider, a.k.a, younger audience). Maudlin music comes in on the soundtrack, letting us know that this part of the movie is supposed to tug on our heartstrings.<br/><br/>I don't buy the inevitable resolution either. I don't believe that it is supported well or justified by what came before it.<br/><br/>The 1st 45 minutes is WELL worth seeing. I wish the filmmakers could have pushed and maintained the pace and feel for the entire movie. Reynolds and Bullock are so good, they could be this generation's Tracy and Hepburn. I'd like to see them in another project that follows through all the way.<br/><br/>BTW, this film was actually shot in Boston and (the Alaska scenes) in Manchester by the Sea and Rockport on the North Shore with digital effects adding snow capped mountains. You might even recognize Motif No.1, a famous small building on a wharf in Rockport which has been the subject of many famous painters' and photographers' work. It was also fun seeing some of my local Boston area acting colleagues doing background work in the film.",
    "It's a real shame that everything I had read about Déjà Vu concerned the high-powered explosions and loud clatter of guru/producer Jerry Bruckheimer. No mention, except maybe as a footnote, was given to A-list director Tony Scott and the magic he has woven in his past three films. The man who brought us Top Gun has seen a sort of revival in style lately with the entertaining Spy Game, the amazing Man on Fire, and the kinetic Domino. Scott has taken the quick cuts of music videos and has infused them into his shooting style. His editor better be making some good money as these films fly by with filters, jump-cuts, grain, and camera angles swiveling at every turn. Greatly overshadowed by brother Ridley Scott and his more serious, award-winning epics, Tony has been pumping out some of the most solid and entertaining films of the past couple decades. With a reuniting of semi-regular star Denzel Washington, Déjà Vu proves that when Bruckheimer is paired with a like mind, his usual drivel can become great. Scott shows us how to hone the explosions, noise, and clutter to an effective level and gives us a helluva ride.<br/><br/>Déjà Vu could have easily reduced itself to timetravel farce, going by the books to show a time warp in order to solve a crime. The far-fetched premise of being able to see the past as it happens four and a half days later should seem crazy and by watching the previews you are given the idea that it will be just a series of do-overs. Fortunately the trailers these days show a totally different movie than what has been crafted. Scott and his screenwriters have not only developed a sci-fi tale seeped in enough reality to at least be looked upon as plausible for the sake of the story, but they nicely tidy up any chance of their being a plothole. Our story begins with a devastating domestic terrorist act upon a ferry carrying over 500 people, Navy and family. Washington's ATF agent is brought in and discovers that it was no accident. Intrigued by the efficiency he displays, an FBI agent, played with nicely effective restraint by Val Kilmer, calls him in to check out a new toy they have to find who the perpetrator is. During the use of this screen of the past, Denzel acquires a feeling of obligation to do all he can to prevent what he sees from occurring in the present, no matter what consequences that might entail for the future. The quest to stop the violence begins with an attractive young woman who unknowingly has become an integral part in what will ultimately transpire.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film is that with multiple timelines being shown parallel to each other, there are many questions that desperately need answering. To credit all involved, they appear to have put themselves in the audience's shoes and piece-by-piece wrote in a reason for everything. Anything that is seen either in the past, present, or future has a reason for being there and will be intelligently explained. Also, the performances are stellar, Denzel and Kilmer as well as a quietly maniacal Jim Caviezel and the emotionally exasperated Paula Patton, and the visuals unique. While Scott has toned down the ultra-kinetic cuts and filters for the main action, his style is still stamped on the graphics of their screen showing the past. The motion trails and speed scans lend a stylized digital editing program feel and are gorgeous to watch. Déjà Vu's best sequence, however, is the crazy car chase during the present in pursuit of a vehicle in the past, definitely a rush and orchestrated almost flawlessly. Even though Ridley gets the accolades and Tony gets the hack/overproduced label, I must say, while they are the best directing duo in Hollywood, I might have to give the edge on pure cinematic entertainment to the younger Tony. He is on a roll and doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon.",
    "I thought \"The Island\" was fantastic and just was a movie worth watching. Ewan and Scarlett were just great together in this on the seat thriller, the story was just very exciting. Especially since cloning is such a huge debate right now, I know that it is going to get more intense in the future. That's the story's main plot, cloning and wither it's right or wrong of playing God.<br/><br/>The story itself just keeps you guessing and thinking with some very great effects. I would without a doubt recommend \"The Island\" for your viewing pleasure. It's a lot of fun, it's got excitement, romance, action, and a plot that actually worked coming from Michael Bay. :D My only complaint is the ending, which I choose not to give away, but it leaves some room for questioning. Other than that, enjoy! <br/><br/>9/10",
    "OK - if you've already seen the movie and hated it, my review won't change your mind, so move along folks, move along, there's nothing to see for you here, thanks.<br/><br/>Now for you, dear film fan, who is about to watch 'The Hateful Eight', but who is now slightly worried because of some very mixed critical reactions - for YOU I'm writing this 100% spoiler-free review.<br/><br/>Judging from many comments here on IMDb and other forums, I gather that many long-time Tarantino fans apparently don't like his newest film. I had feared such a reaction as soon as I had finished watching the movie. It's obviously Tarantino's least accessible effort yet, and there's a number of reasons for that, not the least of which being that this is simply not the film most people expected (or felt they were promised). So if you haven't seen it yet and you're a bit doubtful because of the negative reviews, let me tell you: you'll likely end up loving it - as I did - IF you prepare yourself juuuust a little. And because I really liked the movie, I would like to help you do that via a short list of recommendations. Ready? Here it goes:<br/><br/>1. Don't go watch 'The Hateful Eight' expecting a \"classic\" Western. It might belong to the Western genre, but if all that talk about Ultra 70mm Panavision had you thinking of lush outdoor scenery, vast landscapes or anything resembling a Sergio Leone movie, you'll end up disappointed. There are a few nice shots showing snowy mountains, but 95% (perhaps more) of the story unfolds indoors (in one single room) - which isn't to say that the cinematography isn't absolutely fantastic. In fact, it's more than fantastic: it's stunning and worthy of an Oscar.<br/><br/>2. Don't expect any exciting \"action\" scenes (for lack of a better word: I don't mean the 'Fast & Furious' kind of action scenes) every 10 minutes or so; in fact, don't expect anything other to happen between the characters than dialog for a loooooong time. Unlike in Tarantino's previous films where we got almost \"spoiled\" by unexpected over-the-top moments in nearly every scene (except maybe for 'Jackie Brown' and 'Deathprooof'), this film has a very, very slow build. But: that's not to say it ISN'T exciting (or that nothing does happen) - it's just that the excitement and tension result mainly from the dialog and the excellent performances by the cast (at least for roughly two thirds of the movie).<br/><br/>3. Best approach this film as you would theater; for that's what 'The Hateful Eight' really is: a stage play disguised as a movie. A stage play of a \"Who-Done-It\" murder mystery with a touch of Agatha Christie. But then again, that's also a disguise, for the murder mystery is just a ploy to cast a look at a torn society rife with racial tension after the civil war. Which, of course, again serves as an allegory for race relations in modern-day America and as the director's angry commentary on how hateful that situation still is today, on all sides. Now that sounds awfully serious, but don't worry; despite some hard-to-stomach ugliness and the highly political undercurrent, there is plenty of Tarantino's trademark humor throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>4. Don't expect to find a likable character you can root for. There's a reason for the film's title, and unlike in all his previous films, there is not a single person in Tarantino's latest movie you'll feel any real sympathy for. All the main characters have committed despicable, hateful acts, and they're all beyond redemption - but that doesn't mean they're not compelling to watch (especially given THIS cast: everyone is fantastic, but Jackson, Russell, Jason Leigh and Goggins are just a joy to watch).<br/><br/>5. Don't expect a complex plot. In my opinion, among Q.T's films this is the one with the most straight forward and most simple plot to date, yet at the same time it's arguably his most complex - and most ambitious - film.<br/><br/>So, dear film fan, that's it: adhere to these here 5 \"commandments\", and there's a big chance you'll end up loving Mr. Banana Chin's latest oeuvre as much as I did (mind; you might love the film just as much without taking any of the above advice). I admit, it took me a while to get into this dialog-heavy stage play and would-be Western, but once I did, I never looked back (and I can hardly wait to watch it again). 9 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",
    "I loved this movie, it's so funny :D one of the best comedy movies ever!!! It has (like many movies) a message, that it's best to tell the truth, but above all it was very funny. My favorite scene was: <br/><br/>About Mr. Allen <br/><br/>Miranda: Well, what do you think of him? Fletcher: He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless steaming pile of cow dung, figuratively speaking. a moment passes and Mr. Allen starts laughing. The other board members follow his lead and start laughing also] Mr. Allen: That's the funniest damn thing I have ever heard. You're a real card, Reede. I love a good roast. Do Simmons. Fletcher: Simmons is old. He should have been out of the game years ago but he can't stay home because he hates his wife. You have met her at the Christmas parties, she's the one that gets plastered and calls him a retard, and you, Tom; you're the biggest brown nose I have ever seen. You have got your head so far up Mr. Allen's ass, I can't tell where you end and he begins. Mr. Allen: *roaring with laughter* Priceless! *Fletcher continues with every member* Fletcher: You have bad breath caused by gingivitis. You couldn't get a porn star off. Your hairpiece looks like something that was killed crossing the highway. I don't know whether to comb it or scrape it off with a shovel and bury it in lime. Loser! Idiot! Wimp! Degenerate! *Slut*! Mr. Allen: I like your style, Reede! That's just what this stuffy company needs - a little irreverence! Fletcher: Good! I'll see you later, dick-head! <br/><br/>Great movie!!!",
    "I'm a huge fan of the first Shrek and the second one also exceeded my expectations. Both of those movies had an meaningful and multidimensional plot. They also shared clever humor and for the most part unpredictable. I was extremely excited for the the third movie and I have to unfortunately say I was totally disappointed! The whole time I was waiting for it to start, like trying to convince myself, \"ok, any second now it will pick up\" - but it never did. The plot is so thin and unexciting - Prince Charming wants to takeover the throne while Shrek wants to get a young (King) Arthur to replace him as next in line to the throne. You never really feel any interest in what is happening or what will happen to the characters because you know exactly whats going to happen. Basically I spent the movie forcing myself to laugh because, hey, I was watching a Shrek movie. I know this review will not stop anyone who loved the previous movies from going to the third, but I just want to warn that its nothing to rush to or stand in line for.",
    "The greatest fault of The Thin Red Line was its timing - it was released at around the same time as Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.  While most people dismissed The Thin Red Line as the `other' World War II movie of 1998, it's actually a very different kind of film - the film itself is not hurt by similarity to Ryan but was hurt commercially due to the misconception. It's easy to forget that Red was nominated for seven Oscars.  This is an extraordinary film that can stand well on its own next to Ryan.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan was significant in that it visually depicted war in a realistic, gritty way.  The Thin Red Line's focus is more philosophical. It is about the contradiction between the beauty of nature and the destructive nature of men.  The movie cuts continuously between the external struggle of American GIs fighting to take a crucial hill from Japanese occupation on Guadalcanal - and more importantly, the internal chaos of war as every man tries to come to his own terms about matters such as morals, death, God, and love.<br/><br/>Unlike in Saving Private Ryan, there is nothing patriotic about this movie. In fact, there probably has never been a more anti-war film.  The fighting men here are disillusioned, lost, and frightened.  They don't fight for their country or \"democracy\" - they fight because they have to.  The only priorities are survival, and - for the more humane - caring for their comrades.  Renowned composer Hans Zimmer - who won an Oscar nomination for his work-captures the grim mood perfectly and allows us to hear the men's thoughts.<br/><br/>The characters are portrayed by a strong ensemble cast.  Acting is uniformly excellent, especially Nick Nolte as Colonel Tall, who is the unfeeling commander of the ground offensive on Guadalcanal. Thoroughly unlikable, he is the closest thing to a villain in the movie.  After studying war for an untold number of years, Tall sees Guadalcanal as his chance to prove himself and move up in the ranks - the men are only a tool to accomplish this goal and expendable.  In one crucial scene, he orders a captain (played by Elias Koteas, in another outstanding role) to lead his men to a frontal assault against a Japanese controlled hill.  When the captain suggests a more logical alternative, the colonel screams: \"You are not gonna take your men around in the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!\"  To this, the captain replies, `I've lived with these men, sir, for two and a half years and I will not order them all to their deaths.'  Later, when the hill is taken, he is dismissed of his duties as Tall sees him as a threat to the successful achievement of his goal.  Certainly, not every commander must have been that coldhearted and selfish, but surely some were, though not necessarily to that extreme.<br/><br/>While the acting is very good, much of the cast is relatively unknown and it can initially be hard to distinguish the characters from each other as they may appear to be very similar.  They are all about the same age, have dirt smeared over their faces, and wear helmets and the same military garb. Also, the stars in this movie have very small roles.  George Clooney and John Travolta are credited with starring roles while really little more than extras - clearly for marketing purposes.  You will not see more than two minutes of each.<br/><br/>One of the main themes of the movie is the contrast between nature and men's destructiveness in war.  The director, Terrence Malick, hired cinematographer John Toll to capture this on camera, and towards achieving that goal they couldn't have been more successful.  The almost surreal scenery is nothing short of stunning and has the same visual impact as any special effect.  The beauty of nature is always present, even when it is a setting for battle of destruction, and death.<br/><br/>Though the battle scenes fall short of the frightening realism in Saving Private Ryan, they are heads and soldiers above every previous attempt. One truly gets the sense that war is a chaotic, often hopeless environment where it is only a matter of luck whether you survive or get killed.<br/><br/>\n`How did we lose the good that was given us? Or let it slip away? Scatter it carelessly ... trade it for what has no worth?'  The film is filled with such poetic questions as to which there are no real answers.  This is definitely not a party movie.  There isn't anything uplifting about it - it is downright depressing.  Asides from entertainment value, however, this is a film that makes you think.",
    "... not the movie, but the number of self-professed Holmes aficionados who apparently have no knowledge of Holmes. For the record, Holmes was a miserable, irresponsible drug addict who did indeed sleep on the floor, insult his best friend, experiment on his dog, and never ever wore a deerstalker's cap (at least, not until television was invented). He was a brawler who practiced martial arts and was as likely to slum around in the filthiest of rags as he was a suit.<br/><br/>It wasn't until after Doctor Watson took him in hand that he truly refined himself and became a \"respectable\" member of society. And yes, we can tell that this movie takes place THAT early in their relationship because Watson has not yet married his wife (the retconning did annoy me, too, by the way, but you just can't avoid a little re-imagining here and there).<br/><br/>Speaking of unavoidable, Irene Adler, Holmes' one uncapturable (is that a word?), simply had to be cast as a potential love interest. The flirting, the romance, and the near-make-out session were irresistible to the director (and to all of the audience who're honest with themselves).<br/><br/>That being said, I felt Robert Downey, Jr. played Sherlock Holmes to perfection. His characteristic caustic attitude towards Lestrade and even Watson at times was exactly how I'd imagine him. He gives several summations of his observations and deductions that brought Holmes to life in an almost unparalleled way. His fight scenes (preceded the first few times by superhuman calculations) show both the mental and physical sides of Holmes in ways that Watson's notes can't quite convey, but at which they constantly hint.<br/><br/>As for Watson himself, Jude Law delivered a wonderful performance. I was a little skeptical of how well he fought, given Watson's wartime injury, but his character and demeanor were entirely on the nose. His loyalty to Holmes despite his frustrations with him could not have been captured more expertly, I feel. No one, no matter how patient or forgiving, could endure Holmes forever without the occasional confrontation. The original Holmes, after all, was not above insulting his best friend or even deriding his deductive capabilities at times. Nevertheless, Watson never could abandon his friend in his time of need.<br/><br/>This version (or vision, if you will) of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest creation may be more swashbuckling, more thrilling, and more edgy than any other incarnation, but that doesn't make it any less faithful to the original. Aside from a little revisionist history in the cases of the female leads, nothing is that far out of the ordinary; and no amount of references to Madonna will change that.",
    "SAW III in my opinion is tied with the original as the best in the series. For many reasons- one reason being that it keeps it simple. Instead of dealing with multiple characters that sacrificed any kind of character development like in SAW's II, IV, and V, SAW III, like the original, has much fewer characters, leading to a more intimate setting where we can connect to everyone. And while it does have sub-plots, they don't feel out of place, they're not just randomly thrown in to shock audiences. They feel organic, they all connect smoothly at the end and make sense as to why.<br/><br/>If you've seen a SAW film, you know the story is going to have twists, turns, and violence/gore to accompany them. But at least SAW III does it very well. It expands on characterization and back stories for these characters and ties up the loose ends as believably as this franchise can do. We also get a deeper look at the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda, knowing more about how the two really look at each other. Jigsaw is the calm, cancer-stricken anti-hero who does these evil things to prove a moral standpoint. Amanda, on the other hand, doesn't seem to grasp this - instead using the traps to torture her victims as a way to get back at innocent people for the way she was tortured herself with suicidal tendencies and drug abuse. With these two extremes, we see how much Jigsaw is trying to mentor her in his vision while she struggles with her own demons. And when Jigsaw gets ill, we see that Amanda really isn't a fitting apprentice to carry on his legacy as her vindictiveness comes out.<br/><br/>SAW III is also supported by the fact that the two protagonists are developed deeply. Maybe not as much as our two anti-heros, but we understand where they're coming from. From Lynn's dour nature to devastated Jeff's situation. The subplot with Jeff by the way adds some great underlying messages to the film. These messages shows us that hate, vengeance, revenge, and complacency brings more pain than anything else, and does not solve anything. It ruins families, destroys relationships, clouds judgment, and at the end: self-destruction. Leigh Whannell, who wrote the first two films with James Waan and flew solo writing the screenplay for this one, does a nice job giving the spotlight to all the characters instead of just focusing on Jigsaw and Amanda. He makes SAW III more of a character study than any of the other installments and that's one of the essential reasons why this installment scores high.<br/><br/>Darren Lynn Bousman directs a much more subtle film than he did with SAW II and SAW IV. The quick edits are kept to a bare minimum (thank God) and the film has a lot of dread going for it. Very moody and darkly atmospheric. He focuses on the drama and emotion at hand, which was a vast improvement on SAW II and especially SAW IV. He lets the acting and the situations do the work for him instead of being extra-fancy with the camera work. Lastly, the cinematography is a plus. Darren shoots the film with a vibrant and kinetic feel and uses good, non-queasy camera movements. I love the lighting most of all though; he uses a wide arrange in the color palette (from lime green to icy blue). He definitely proves here that he knows how to grasp the material and visualize it. His direction of III ranks alongside James Waan's mindblowing direction of the original.<br/><br/>The acting is hardly an issue. It's usually good or better. Tobin Bell can play John Kramer in his sleep by now for gods sake! He shows excellent range and is always effective in the role because he gives the character more depth than what the script probably provides. Shawnee Smith is superb as Amanda, who will always be one of my favorite characters in the series. This is without a single doubt her shining moment, her most dramatic portion in the series. You really want to hate her but you just can't because you pity her. Smith could have easily played the character as an annoying nutjob, but she gives the character substance and unbelievable humanality. Angus Macfadyen as Jeff is superb in his role as well; he makes Jeff the most realistic and sympathetic character within the entire series. As far as I'm concerned, McFayden nailed the mourning father act. Bahar Soomekh was decent but always outshone by Bell, Smith, and McFayden. Her acting was a bit flimsy at times, but for the most part she gave a nice performance and made her character likable.<br/><br/>The suspense and tension, while not as impressive as the original, is still great. Hardly any other Saw film or horror film in general for that matter (with the exception of Eden Lake from last year and Inside from 2007) has been so edge-of-your-seat gripping, so exciting. The slow pacing allows you to gradually absorb everything in, and this makes it all the more better.<br/><br/>There is a lot of extreme gore in this film, but unlike some other installments like Saws IV and V, it's done very well and serves a purpose. Jeff's bloody trials are in a lot of ways cathartic. You're enduring these horrific scenes along with Jeff, and the relief at the end that the horror is over really fits with the theme of redemption through forgiveness. Moreover, the revelation that the horror isn't over, and what you feel as a result, drives home the Shakespearean tragedy in a very personal way because you the audience have to keep enduring it.<br/><br/>SAW III is clever, solidly written, has the best characters, succeeds with the emotional aspect it was going for, and ties up loose ends perfectly. For a third installment in a horror series, it's incredibly strong.",
    "Do not look at this through the prism of \"Foreign Films\". You'd be wasting your time and miss something far too important.<br/><br/>Hollywood does scale like nobody else, leaving the competition gasping in its wake. France does intimacy, and brutality. Nothing is sacred. And rather than try to revive the New Wave or emulate Hollywood like most widely seen French films of late, \"Intouchables\" harnesses its core strengths - ease with intimacy, willingness to ridicule anything and brutal honesty - and delivers one of the funniest, most honest and touching films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Sy is a failed robber, going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless émigré. Cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body. The circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here, but meet they do, and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each other.<br/><br/>The film's simplicity is delightfully misleading: the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing, and however good the rest of the cast is, the central duo is magical. Sy's comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. Cluzet isn't your typical sad-sack, instead, much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him (a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit, you'll know it when you see it).<br/><br/>This is one of the most unique, beautiful and honest friendships ever committed to film. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry... a delightful celebration of everything in life that makes it worthwhile.",
    "The movie, \"Se7en\", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.<br/><br/>The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from \"The Divine Comedy\", sets out to, \"preach\" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.<br/><br/>Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.<br/><br/>Score 10/10",
    "You've often heard the sales pitch, \"adults will love it, too!\" almost always referring to a kids' movie and in particularly, an animated movie for children. Well, in this case I agree. Even as a middle-aged adult, I enjoyed this.<br/><br/>The dialog is adult-friendly but at the same time not coarse or crude with no sexual innuendos, no profanity or even a hint of it. Yet, it's hip with some very clever lines.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and offers a few unique twists. David Spade does a fabulous job narrating, has a very pleasing voice, one that's fun to hear. I actually do think adults would like this more than children.",
    "We just got back from the earliest showing we could get a sitter for. I can say with confidence that my fears about this movie were totally unfounded, and I now hold Guy Ritchie and these writers in the highest regard. Without going into spoilers, here are the three concerns that were put entirely to rest: 1) After seeing the trailer, my biggest worry was the use of \"bullet-time\" type photography during a Victorian-era movie. I thought it would be completely anachronistic and pointless. However, they'd already established in this movie and the previous one that Holmes is hyper-aware of his surroundings. The bullet-time was used to convey how traumatic a couple of scenes were to someone with that type of awareness, and it worked beautifully.<br/><br/>2) Jared Harris looked so vanilla and soft in the promo pics and trailers that I couldn't imagine him as a fearsome adversary for Holmes. However, his Moriarty is so devious and cunning, and at one time downright sadistic, that I don't think they could have made a better choice. A couple of times I felt like he was channeling his father (the outstanding Richard Harris) without the warmth and empathy that the late actor conveyed. Can you imagine Richard Harris as a cunning, calculating perfectionist that's totally devoid of concern for human life? You won't have to after watching his son. It's freaky. And he sings.<br/><br/>3) Holmes' relationship with Watson (and in a small way, Irene Adler) is fantastically developed. Saying any more than that would be too spoilery.<br/><br/>So, watching this w/ my husband(who is a die-hard Sherlock fan, and used to read Sherlock Holmes aloud to me every rainy night, complete w/ voices) was a fabulous experience. We can't wait to see it again, and own it.",
    "Train to Busan was a treat. <br/><br/>A look into Selfishness vs Selflessness and Individual vs The Collective.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a foreign film this much.

    "Eclipse is the beset Twilight movie so far and now I'm starting to give this series a little mercy. Yes, the writing is still bad, the CGI is awful, there's no chemistry between the leads, there's a lot of laughable dialogue, and terrible characters, but I enjoyed the movie and that's what movies are supposed to do. I'm actually going to watch the next movie with an open mind even if this movie wasn't that good.",
    "I walked into the movie theater expecting to see Adam Sandler make a complete buffoon of himself. However, when I came out I was impressed. There was a depth to this movie I did not see coming, and it took me completely off guard. \"Click\" proved to be a powerful, emotional, and humorous piece of work. There was a certain philosophical message in this movie, in which I think, we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work-aholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie, and in \"Click\" he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh. Definitely a 10/10 in my book.",
    "I often find that in order to be captivating, a film these days needs to be stressfully suspenseful or have a complicated story line. This film had neither, and yet I found myself hoping it wouldn't end while at the same time, anxiously awaiting its conclusion. I have to admit, I was distrustful of Burton as many of his more recent films have had less-than-satisfying conclusions. Nonetheless, I went to see Big Fish (3 days before its release in Canada) with no expectations and was astounded. This movie is an absolute treat for our hearts, ears and especially our eyes with each cartoon/fantasy-like scene painted with Tim Burton's reliable brilliance and magical touch. Ewan McGregor is pure sunshine and Albert Finney gives one of the greatest performances of the year- he *is* Big Fish. But I suppose that when you strip away the beauty, the doll-house sets and all the abracadabra of cinematography and modern day technology, all you have is a very simple story, and therein lies the heart of this film; that one can create their own legacy, \"the story of my life.\" Not through either extreme of extraordinary adventure or unbelievable lies, but through the art of storytelling- and THAT is what this film is about. It is through our *stories* that we are immortal.<br/><br/>Go see this movie, bring the kids, bring your date, bring your parents! It is for everyone...everyone who appreciates a visually and emotionally beautiful irregular story about a regular person's life.<br/><br/>***** 5 stars!!",
    "A Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent from the future to kill the unborn son of Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) in the original. Now, that Terminator has been sent back again but with a different assignment: Protect John Connor. John Connor(Edward Furlong) is now about 10 years of age and must evade a new Terminator sent to kill him;The T-1000(Robert Patrick). Sarah, John, and The Terminator journey together on their quest to stop Judgement Day, with a trailing, shape-shifting Termiantor trailing from behind.<br/><br/>This is the greatest of the Terminator trilogy. I have watched three times in the past year and have not found anything that Cameron could have improved on. The move is a masterpiece in every aspect of film. Schwarzenegger's acting might not be incredible but this is the perfect role for him. He isn't supposed to show emotion or feelings. He is a machine. I hate almost every one of his movies besides this trilogy because he is a horrible actor but he works perfectly into this role.<br/><br/>The special effects are incredible beyond belief. The shape-shifting T-1000 is some of the greatest animation I have witnessed in cinema history. It absolutely blew my mind when I first experienced this visual extravaganza. The animation looked so real(remembering this was a good ten years). The movie included fast-paced action along with some clever sci-fi drama/horror. The idea of a vast army of machines taking over the world after sending off warheads to every major city should be scary enough. But the T-1000 has very little lines and is just creepy enough to make twitch when you see him.<br/><br/>Sci-fi movies can rarely be made in such way that can be looked at as works of art. This is one of the few exceptions. The prediction of judgment day with Hamilton watching a playground full of kids be burnt to the ground is an absolute brilliant portrayal of Armageddon. The theme that men will destroy themselves is also shown throughout the movie also and is even said by The Terminator\" It's in your nature to destroy yourselves\". This brings the movie to a whole new level of sci-fi.<br/><br/>Overall, Termiantor II: Judgement Day is an absolute must see classic. If you have not seen it, buy it! Because once you have seen it, you will want to do so anyways. It is fast paced and highly enjoyable for just about every audience.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "This movie is one of Johnny Depp's best. Regarding content, this movie definitely flows at a high pace, but it lacks the violence that is characteristic of so many other American criminal movies. However, this fact does not bother me at all, and I actually really loved this movie, but I think that the lack of violence may be why so many other people rated this movie with a low score. In addition, I noticed something funky going on with Depp's hairstyle: it's reminiscent of 21 Jump Street! The way his hair is combed in this movie very much reminds me of his bad-boy hairstyle midway through the television sitcom. As a result, Depp appears to be much younger in this movie than in many of his other movies from this time era.",
    "Went to an advance screening expecting your usual \"shy kid in high school learns to stick up for himself\" sort of feel-good drama. This movie is so much more than that - I was truly blown away by the mature themes and moving characters. Mental illness, sexual abuse, drugs and alcohol... I think the writer/screenwriter/director said it best in the Q+A after when he said it was a film that looked at the emotional aspects of that point in life without being sentimental. I really cared about these three teens - Charlie, Sam, and Patrick - and their story never felt cheesy. Just real, and moving, and touching. Go see this movie!",
    "Another WWII movie but instead of D-Day and the Battle of Dunkirk, it's the Battle of Okinawa in Japan. Which means, new branch of military and new settings. Usually I want war movies to focus on the historical accuracies and action rather than characters, but this movie changed my opinion. It tells the story of Desmond Doss and his life and how he joined the army, that was very interesting and well-acted. The beginning explained our main character and introduced all the others, who are also a good addition. BUT the rest of the movie is awesome. The battle scene is engaging, heart-wrenching, and epic. It is very gruesome, some may not like that, but that's how it actually happened - when you get hit with a bullet, there's going to be blood. The fight portrayed Desmond's goal and his heart to save others, which you have to respect. Not only does this movie provide adrenaline, but also a learning experience.",
    "Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.<br/><br/>No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that, you're probably going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.<br/><br/>No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.<br/><br/>The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.<br/><br/>Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.<br/><br/>It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.<br/><br/>That being said, the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.<br/><br/>I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed & bigger budgeted movies, it will be a movie like this one, that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.<br/><br/>And while we're at it, hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive, well acted portrayal.",
    "Tom Hanks wrote and directed this paean to the glory days of rock n' roll, an era in which even the wildest music still reflected a certain innocence, long since gone if not forgotten, before the advent of Metal, Rap and Grunge.  It's 1964, and `That Thing You Do!' is about to become a hit record for a small band out of Erie, Pa., who call themselves the `Oneders (pronounced Wonders),' but who are destined to begin their musical odyssey know as the `Oh-NEED-ers.'  Drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) works in his father's appliance store, but when the band's drummer breaks his arm right before a gig, Guy is asked to sit in for him.  And it winds up being a case of being in the right place at the right time for Guy, like when Ringo joined The Beatles, and the rest-- as they say-- is history.<br/><br/>\tIt's a lively, upbeat tale in which luck, talent and chance all play a part.  Hanks presents the upside of making it in the music business, including the adrenaline rush of hearing one's own song on the radio for the first time, as well as all the hoopla that surrounds those who happen to be in the spotlight at the moment.  But he also shows the downside:  The creative differences and in-fighting which plagues just about any band ever formed to some degree at one time or another, the personality conflicts and petty jealousies that are apt to surface at any time, and the reality of dealing with bloated egos, adoring fans and rude, insensitive record label executives who could care less about the talent that is putting the coins in their coffers, as long as they're selling records.<br/><br/>\tFor the most part, Hanks keeps it lighthearted and cheerful, which-- along with the original songs (some of which he helped write)-- makes this an entertaining, fun and thoroughly enjoyable movie.  He sugar-coats the dark side of it all to a certain extent, which makes the bad things that happen a bit easier to swallow, though it compromises the impact of the events somewhat as they unfold.  Then again, he manages to maintain the credibility and integrity of his story, and after all, `this' is the film he wanted to make, and he presents it exactly as intended.  Hanks captures a sense of time and place with this film, and also that same sense of reality conveyed by The Beatles' film, `A Hard Day's Night,' intentionally avoiding the more stoic reality of the more recent `Almost Famous.'  All three films are fairly true to life, but with varying degrees of honesty.  It's a matter of whether to `imply,' as Hanks has done, or to be explicit, as Cameron Crowe chose to do with his film.<br/><br/>\tWith this film Hanks proves that he is equally as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it; he knows exactly where he wants to take his audience and when, and he does it quite successfully.  He also extracts some nice performances from his actors, especially Scott, Johnathon Schaech (Jimmy, the lead singer), Steve Zahn (Lenny, on guitar) and Liv Tyler as Faye Dolan, Jimmy's girlfriend, who takes the brunt of the blunt edge of Jimmy's sudden notoriety.  Hanks also turns in a notable performance himself, as Mr. White, the representative of one of the labels interested in the Oneders.<br/><br/>\tThe supporting cast includes Ethan Embry (The Bass Player), Charlize Theron (Tina), Obba Babatunde (Lamarr), Giovanni Ribisi (Chad), Chris Ellis (Phil), Alex Rocco (Sol), Bill Cobbs (Del Paxton), Peter Scolari (Tony), Rita Wilson (Marguerite), Chris Isaak (Uncle Bob) and Kevin Pollak (Boss Koss).  What `Happy Days' was to television, `That Thing You Do!' is to movies; a film that evokes that perceived sense of  innocence of a time when life at least seemed simpler.  For the more distance you put between the present and the `Good old days,' the better they get.  In reality, they may not have been better, but Hanks preserves that illusion by giving us a picture of the way we'd at least like to think things were.  And it's more than a pleasant diversion; this is a feel-good film you'll be able to enjoy time and again, because it takes you to a place you'd like to be-- a place you've been to before at one time or another, in one way or another, if only in your mind. And that Hanks can take you there so readily is not only a credit to his talent, but another fine example of the pure magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",
    "Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot in the way of story and character development, but suffice it to say, it serves its purpose. What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. The pop culture references are still present, but I found them to be more clever and funny this time around, and in much smaller amounts. I was smiling through virtually the entire film, and had about 5 or 6 hard laugh-out-loud moments throughout. As expected, I was also very impressed by the voice cast in this movie. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen's performance as B.O.B.. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway.<br/><br/>The 3D, while not used as effectively as it was in Coraline, is still one of the more impressive showcasings that I've seen, and that's largely due to the film's incredible action sequences. Seriously, this is some of the best action that I've seen in an animated film; as far as I'm concerned, it's right up there with that of The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Monsters vs. Aliens to be a surprisingly entertaining film, with clever and witty dialogue, as well as terrific action. I'm not usually in favor of sequels, but if they're able to keep it as balanced and charming, I would honestly like to see this become a successful, long-running franchise. Nice job, folks at DreamWorks Animation.",
    "This is the raunchiest of the Scary Movies. If you thought the original was \"too much\", well, this one will truly give you more reasons to avoid it for it's vulgar content and crude sex jokes. That's for you, easily offended people. <br/><br/>I had a great time with it when it first came out in theaters. I really liked the crude sex humor and vulgar spoofs. So for those who are into sex jokes and scatological humor, you will be amused.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is truly hilarious and in my opinion, the best part of the movie. It was about time that the \"Scary Movie\" franchise had an Exorcist spoof! It was great. James Woods in the role of Father Merrin delivers a hysterical performance relying most of his scenes on scatological humor and profanity. For example, when Reagan says \"f*** me\" and he immediately jumps into her and simulates to be penetrating her. Another example is the line where Reagan's mother says \"she won't even let me touch her!\" and the priest responds \"yeah sometimes that happens, you have to give candy to the children\" (or something like that); obviously referring to recent pederastry cases. On the other side, the movie also has \"classical\" but always effective teen humor . For example, when entering the room for the first time, he gets scared and runs away when Reagan turns her head on 180º; and the always effective vomiting cycle. <br/><br/>After the Exorcist spoof, the movie centers on the Poltergeist and Entity spoofs. That's when the movie takes a new direction and does not changes from it. Expect spoofs from popular t.v. commercials, songs (Vitamin C), and even racist and homophobic jokes. The sex jokes worth a watch specially on the infamous clown scene, and the sex ghost. <br/><br/>\"Scary Movie 2\" does not \"cross\" the line on the vulgar factor. It's just a good rated R movie with spoofs for all tastes; of course, if you are not easily offended. But be sure to watch it on DVD; do not watch the t.v. version because it's very cut (specially on dialogs).<br/><br/>This is in my opinion the best of the \"Scary Movies\".",
    "This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy, giant boulders and occult seeking Nazis. Story conceived by George Lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If that doesn't sell it, then look no further than Steven Spielberg because he directed it. Awesome movie all around and definitely a genre classic. An absolute must see for any movie fan that likes fun.",
    "Because I lived in Sierra Leone, in fact in Kono, the diamond-mining area of the country, for three years, I had to see Blood Diamond as soon as it came out. It is an excellent movie. Although it was not filmed in Sierra Leone, it captures the reality of the country to a remarkable degree. There is a great deal of violence in this movie, but that violence is organic, realistic, fitting to what happened there. They even manage to convey the fact that the people are as astonished by this violence as we are; Sierra Leone used to be one of the safest countries in the world. The movie tells the facts about conflict diamonds quickly and accurately. DiCaprio's performance is impressive, certainly the best by him I've ever seen: he is totally believable as a white African. Jennifer Connelly's role is much smaller but she makes the most of it. Djiman Housou has enormous physical presence as the brave Mende fisherman. This movie just gets so many things right that the few places it departs from reality are entirely forgivable. I would heartily recommend this movie to everyone; it is the best Hollywood movie I've seen in years.",
    "The Favourite, the seventh feature from Greek auteur <a href=\"/name/nm0487166/\">Yorgos Lanthimos</a>, is a film that eschews both convention and expectation. On the other hand, it's also Lanthimos's most accessible by a country mile. A savage morality play, a camp comedy of manners, a Baroque tragedy, an allegorical study of the corruptive nature of power - it's all of these and yet none of them. A film I liked but didn't love, on the one hand, it's too long, the plot too threadbare, and the metaphors and allegories too ill defined. On the other, the acting is flawless, it looks amazing, the first half is very, very funny, and the end is very, very dark, with the last shot one of the most haunting/disturbing images I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Set in England in 1708, the film tells the story of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (an icy <a href=\"/name/nm0001838/\">Rachel Weisz</a>) and one-time scullery maid Abigail Hill (<a href=\"/name/nm1297015/\">Emma Stone</a>, charting a course from doe-eyed ingénue to vicious Machiavellian intrigant) and their increasingly bitter rivalry for the affections of Queen Anne (an absolutely mesmerising <a href=\"/name/nm1469236/\">Olivia Colman</a>), and is the first film Lanthimos has directed which neither he nor <a href=\"/name/nm3328207/\">Efthymis Filippou</a> wrote (the script was originally written by <a href=\"/name/nm7629302/\">Deborah Davis</a> in 1998 and later refined by <a href=\"/name/nm1110111/\">Tony McNamara</a>). Although it deals with real historical personages and events, historians probably won't be too thrilled to learn that Lanthimos is relatively uninterested in either historical actuality or socio-political contextualisation (to say nothing of the slam dancing). This is a story about a love triangle, with everything else just the background noise against which that triangle plays out.<br/><br/>And it is most definitely a Yorgos Lanthimos film, with his peculiar Weltanschauung omnipresent. The emotionless and monotone delivery of dialogue has been scaled back considerably from <a href=\"/title/tt3464902/\">The Lobster (2015)</a> and <a href=\"/title/tt5715874/\">The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017)</a>, but everything else you'd expect is here - the pseudo-omniscient judgemental glare; the dark absurdist humour; the formal rigidity; the emotional isolation of the characters; the surrealism; the games of psychological one-upmanship; the alienation of the audience; the thematic centrality of shifting power relations; the lack of distinction between poignancy and joviality; the use of self-contained and closed off pocket universes where characters must play by rules differing from those of the outside world; intimate familial conflict (except in bigger rooms than in his previous films); and a disorienting score. Similarly, whilst The Lobster was a savage dystopian-set allegory for discipline and conformity, The Favourite is a merciless satire of decadence and pettiness, taking in such additional themes as class, gender, love, lust, duty, loyalty, partisan politics, patriarchal hegemony, and women behaving just as appallingly as men.<br/><br/>As one would expect from Lanthimos, the film is aesthetically flawless, with many of the compositions having the appearance of a fête galante painting, so meticulously integrated are <a href=\"/name/nm0694309/\">Sandy Powell</a>'s costume design, <a href=\"/name/nm2356249/\">Fiona Crombie</a>'s production design, and <a href=\"/name/nm0752811/\">Robbie Ryan</a>'s cinematography. Powell's costumes are historically inaccurate, but thematically revealing, with the situation of the characters at any given moment directly influencing the design, especially in relation to Abigail as she climbs the social ladder. In a more general sense, the black-and-white colour scheme of much of the wardrobe contrasts magnificently with Crombie's predominantly brown production design, with the actors effortlessly standing out from the backgrounds.<br/><br/>Of Ryan's photography, perhaps the most impressive feat is that, despite the many scenes tracking characters through rooms, up stairs, and out doorways, there's not a single Steadicam shot anywhere in the film. He also makes copious use of 6mm fish-eye lenses, which distort the spaces the characters occupy whilst also showing much more of the environment than a normal lens, creating the sense of characters lost within an overload of background visual detail. Combined with the whip pans seen throughout the film, the cumulative effect is a world rendered strange, a place of distortion and unnatural compositions. As with most of Lanthimos' work, the film also uses natural light, which makes for some stunning candle-lit night-time compositions, partially recalling the paintings of someone like Jean-Antoine Watteau or, even moreso, Georges de La Tour.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, there really are no words to describe just how good Colman is. Utterly inhabiting the character, she is able to elicit empathy mere moments after behaving thoroughly shamefully, communicating a sense of both tragic inevitability and a childlike refusal to accept reality. The character could easily have been a grotesque villain or a pitiful broken shell, but Colman finds a nobler middle ground, straddling both interpretations without fully committing to either, moving from one to the other seamlessly throughout the film. Yes, she can be a horrible person with appalling manners and questionable hygiene, but she is also deeply lonely, a survivor who has lost 17 children in childbirth, a woman whose health has made her old before her time, a tragic figure too naïve to see how badly she is being manipulated by Sarah and Abigail. Rather than trying to downplay the contradictory facets of the character, Colman leans into them, illuminating Anne's humanity amongst her least appealing characteristics, and finding both wit and pathos in a character whose mercurial nature and excessive neediness could easily have rendered her the film's antagonist. It truly is one of the finest on-screen performances in a long time.<br/><br/>The film's most salient theme, one could argue its very raison d'être, is the dynamic of gender politics. For starters, it's headlined by three actresses (something which is still rare enough as to be notable), whilst the men are portrayed as petty, vainglorious idiots. Men, in general, are background players, existing only to be mocked, exploited, and duped - with their ridiculous wigs and heavy makeup, they exist only to support the women. However, what's especially interesting about the film's depiction of gender is that the world of women is anything but a utopia. Yes, it's relatively free of toxic masculinity and the male gaze, but in most other aspects, there's no real difference between the matriarchy and the patriarchy. Sure, the women are much smarter than the men who surround them, but they are no less greedy or cruel. At the film's post-première press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Lanthimos explained, \"what we tried to do is portray women as human beings. Because of the prevalent male gaze in cinema, women are portrayed as housewives, girlfriends...Our small contribution is we're just trying to show them as complex and wonderful and horrific as they are, like other human beings.\" Similarly, when asked by the Hollywood Reporter if a film about females treating each other badly might be considered a setback in a post #MeToo era, Colman explained, \"How can it set women back to prove that women fart and vomit and hate and love and do all the things men do? All human beings are the same. We're all multifaceted, many-layered, disgusting and gorgeous and powerful and weak and filthy and brilliant. That's what's nice. It doesn't make women an old-fashioned thing of delicacy.\"<br/><br/>As regards criticisms, although I personally wouldn't class them as flaws, some people will probably dislike the same things that many have disliked in Lanthimos's previous work - cold formal rigidity, perverse sense of humour, and irredeemable characters being irredeemably horrible to one another. There will be those who find the obviously intentional anachronisms too much, whilst others will take umbrage with the disregard for historical authenticity. For me, whilst I admire Lanthimos for trying to bring something new to his oeuvre, especially when compared to Sacred Deer (which just repeated the beats of The Lobster), I felt the film was oftentimes trying to work its way through an identity crisis, unsure of exactly what kind of tone to settle on. I had similar feelings about the allegories that run throughout, and are never what you would call fully fleshed out. Obviously, it's a treatise on power and the ridiculous opulence of royalty, but that's not exactly an untapped issue in cinema. Additionally, one of my biggest problems with Sacred Deer was how utterly pointless it felt, and although I got a lot more out of The Favourite, I had something of the same reaction to it. It could also be argued that the characters are a little two dimensional, and filmgoers who need a protagonist to latch onto, someone to root for, will be left rudderless.<br/><br/>Superior to <a href=\"/title/tt1859446/\">Alpeis (2011)</a> and Sacred Deer, but not a patch on <a href=\"/title/tt1379182/\">Kynodontas (2009)</a> or The Lobster, The Favourite will probably attract a sizable unprepared audience because of awards buzz, positive reviews, and excellent trailer. Undoubtedly, for a lot of people, this will be their first exposure to Lanthimos, and I can only imagine what people expecting a Merchant Ivory costume drama will make of it all. Neither morally enlightening nor historically respectful, The Favourite offers a bleak assessment of humanity's core drives; not Lanthimos's bleakest, but a hell of a lot more nihilistic than an average multiplex goer will be used to. The characters within the film live in a milieu of egotism, narcissism, sexual cruelty, psychological bullying, greed, and hunger for power. There's barely a hint of sentimentality, and very little that could be called morally righteous. I would have liked it to have more meat on its bones, but at the same time, one cannot deny that it presents something of a faithful looking-glass, as Lanthimos continues to corner the market in pointing out not just humanity's worst foibles, but its most egregious eccentricities and lamentable character defects.",
    "Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****<br/><br/>What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.<br/><br/>In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. <br/><br/>Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. <br/><br/>Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. <br/><br/>We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. <br/><br/>These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. <br/><br/>Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. <br/><br/>Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>4/4",
    "Opening up with the shooting of Aldos Snow's latest music video and then showing his downward spiral that leads to present day was the hilarious, perfect beginning for this innovative comedic spin-off. If you saw 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' then this is exactly what you would expect a movie about Aldos Snow to be like. This movie has a heart that I did not expect to see, it's buried under lewd, vulgar and brilliant wit, but it's in there.<br/><br/>Russell Brand just opens his mouth and his words are comedic gold. Jonah Hill takes a step out of his comfort zone, a bit, and plays a \"no confidence good guy\". (Usually he's the overconfident prick, for all you naysayers). Diddy delivers a surprisingly strong performance that I'm sure shocked anyone who sees him. He's actually hilarious! His repartee with everyone he comes into contact with is spot-on. The entire cast has hilarious one-liners and the two main characters really make this movie a joy to watch.<br/><br/>The plot is actually a creative one, something we don't see a lot of nowadays. Albeit the humor treads into \"familiar gross-out\" jokes, there are clever jokes too. But it's all you have to expect when following \"Rock and Roll personified\". Another point I was surprised by was that a lot... a lot of the scenes from the trailers were not in the movie. I thought that was a good and bad thing. Good because it didn't show us stuff we've already seen and gave us the chance to see new stuff. But bad because a few of the scenes were real funny.<br/><br/>For the critics who are hating this movie: Do you like comedy? Do you like Apatow's stuff? Do you like Russell Brand or Jonah Hill? If the answer is no to any 2 of these... why are you reviewing this movie? Your opinion is pointless for the people that actually DO like these movies.",
    "Well, I'll tell you what. I'm not a big fan of animated features but this one was a blast and a half. Just when I thought Flash the Sloth at the Zootown DMV couldn't be topped, we wind up meeting Mr. Big doing the Marlon Brando \"Godfather\" bit. I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn't run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn't stop laughing.<br/><br/>I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis's Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.<br/><br/>As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like 'being all you can be' and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I'll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - \"I want to try even though I could fail...\". It's a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don't measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message.",
    "Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with Bill Murray losing his job, girlfriend, and apartment, all in the same day. He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups, exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, \"I think your ready for the Special Olympics!\" Harold also shines in a bit-part in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand, \"You speak some English?\" The student answers back \"SOB and $hit\" and the whole class than repeats it.<br/><br/>The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy joins the fun as likable, lovable \"Ox.\" There are the typical sex gags, simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.<br/><br/>After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine, having silly one-lines like, \"Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do.\" rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe, the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.",

    "While most movies that pit humans against horrendous extra terrestrials end up being cheap imitations of the 'Aliens' series, Pitch Black stands as a fine piece of Sci-Fi, and an excellent movie all around.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is the lighting.  This movie beautifully employs many different colors, shades and intensities of light which set the mood and lend a unique feeling to the film itself, something different than the 'normal' movie lighting we are generally subjected to.  Vin Diesel brings his character to life in an excellent manner, skillfully avoiding the routine portrayal of the hardened criminal.  After all, the film is about Riddick's (Diesel's character) personal journey, so thankfully Vin doesn't drop the ball.  The remainder of the cast (with the exception of the talented and gorgeous Claudia Black) were unknown to me but all turned in marvelous performances, animating the diverse characters with unique quirks and mannerisms.  Pitch Black is a perfect example of making a great film with out the resources of an excessive budget.  The special effects are more than adequate, but at the same time they are by no means the sole focus, as in many high budget 'blockbusters'.  It's a great movie because it uses Science Fiction as a medium to tell an engaging, provoking story, rather then telling a mediocre story to use the flash of Science Fiction.",
    "So it was with much trepidation and even utter fear in my heart that I went to see this movie. After all, the last time I went to see a full-length adaptation of a favorite Christmas story, what I got was Ron Howard's absolutely God-awful \"The Grinch\". Having grown up with the book \"The Polar Express\" (according to my mom, I cited it as my favorite Christmas present when I was seven), I did not want to see this story bastardized in any way. Honestly, I was prepared for \"Polar Express\" to be a complete wreck. But instead <br/><br/>It soared. Completely. What makes the film such a success is not so much even the story itself, but an execution which somehow manages to inject every frame of the film with a feeling of childlike wonder and exuberance. In addition, there are so many clever touches and details added throughout that a feeling of mystery and excitement just fills the viewer. Among these are the waiters dancing and singing while serving hot chocolate to the kids on the train (a very funny scene, as well), the factory where the presents are prepared, and a ghost-like hobo who is never really explained, but is incredibly crucial to the feel of the film. At one point, three of the children wander lost through the empty streets of Santa's North Pole town. As they wander, various old Christmas recordings are heard playing on phonographs throughout the town. The music provides a pleasant and nostalgic ambiance to the scene. It's touches like this that absolutely make the film.<br/><br/>I'll never understand why films seem to be required to be at least 90 minutes long. I would pay money to see a 40-minute film, as long as it were good. And even if it sucked, I would have at least wasted less time. What I'm getting at is I have no idea why a 32-page picture book needed to be a 99-minute movie. What this means is that the original story is VASTLY expanded upon. However, what is added in actually fits quite well with the essence and spirit of the book. Some of it is just sheer entertainment; the train track is like a roller coaster, characters ski on top of the cars, danger lurks around every step of the journey to the North Pole (but admittedly fun danger). Other aspects further illuminate and expand upon the book's basic theme of the virtue of belief in the implausible. So I have no idea why this was made into a full-length, but in the end, I'm glad it was. It didn't even feel too long (and I think everything is too long).<br/><br/>Much criticism has fallen on the look of the characters in the movie. I can agree to a point. While there is incredible visual detail in the faces, they usually seem void of expression. In general, a lot of the motion seems rather wooden, as well. The scenery, on the other hand, is gorgeous. Overall, the minor problems in animation (which really boil down to a matter of taste anyway) are certainly not enough to diminish what is an overwhelmingly successful movie. Score: 8/10",
    "As a huge Woody Allen fan, I was delighted and surprised by this film.  I have scarcely heard anyone mention it, but for my money it is the single most comically dense of all of Woody's films.  There are so many truly impressive/hilarious/memorable one-liners that I'm amazed people don't quote this movie left and right. The setting, costumes, accents all add to the hilarity of the film--truly reminiscent of a Marx Brothers romp.  Really outstanding among his pre-Annie Hall films.  Only rivaled by Bananas in my opinion for simple laugh value.<br/><br/>Unlike any other of his films, this deals with his \"deep\" questions of death/metaphysics in an unflaggingly light and comical fashion.  For instance:<br/><br/>Sonja: But judgment of any system or a priori relation of phenomena exists in any rational or metaphysical or at least epistemological contradiction to an abstracted empirical concept such as being or to be or to occur in the thing itself or of the thing itself.<br/><br/>Boris: Yeah, I've said that many times.<br/><br/>Not Woody's \"best\" film (see Annie Hall, Manhattan, Crimes and Misdemeanors), but perhaps his most laugh-filled. Satisfying throughout.  I give it a 9/10.",
    "Gripping, brutal and powerful, 'The Last King of Scotland' is a brilliant dramatic depiction of the life of megalomaniac Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin, perfectly portrayed by Forest Whitaker in his Oscar-winning performance as one of the greatest casting against type roles seen in film. His Amin is capricious and unpredictable, a personality that can seem volcanic one moment and vulnerable a few minutes later. A blunt and brutal tale, and one that is highly engaging from start to finish. A taut political thriller about power and corruption. Macdonald's riveting and incandescent direction caps this fictionalised drama, a truly stunning flick that remains as a highlight of film in 2006.",
    "Definitely not my favorite of the 3 but it's hard when the first 2 were just that good. It still portrays well, from my historical knowledge, much of the struggle of the mob families to legitimize their business dealings and try to enjoy life in the later age of the mafia in America. Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films.",
    "Win Win is a charming delightful film about an ordinary family dealing with the struggles of everyday life. Writer/Director Tom McCarthy should be commended for his excellent work. Paul Giamatti – a true everyman actor – delivers a wonderful performance as a lawyer and wrestling coach struggling with the challenges of family and money in New Jersey. In the process of taking guardianship for an elderly client Giamatti's character, Mike Flaherty, becomes enmeshed in the old man's family when the old man's grandson shows up literally on his front doorstep. The teenager turns out to be an incredible wrestler, which is a great asset to Mike's awful wrestling team. And then things begin to get complicated. Giamatti specializes in bringing forth flawed characters that are delightfully human. This is a funny, sweet film that combines comedy and drama. Win Win also reminds us that family goes well beyond blood relatives; family is the constantly evolving circle of people that we love and care about. I literally walked out of theater just feeling much better than when I walked in. That has to be one of the best ways to judge any film.",
    "Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, two of the biggest names in Hollywood, two people who could literally make any film they wanted to, and instead they settle on a feel-good dramedy... good thinking Steven. 'The Terminal' is a charming adaptation of a true story about a foreign civilian stuck in an American airport terminal lounge after his country faces war. The thing that makes this film worth watching are the excellent performances from the amiable cast and the sympathetic direction from Spielberg. After watching some of the behind the scenes as well, I was amazed at how the crew had built a full-size replica airport in a hangar in LA complete with working escalators, the attention to detail is astounding, and this makes the film that much more worth sitting through. 'The Terminal' is an entertaining comedy-drama that explores humanity and sentimentality, a spectacular flick from Spielberg and Hanks.",
    "This movie was entertaining and exceeded expectations. I love history and am a history degree holder with an emphasis and ancient Indo European culture. I'm not here to tear into this movie as a I felt it was just fine, but rather try to deflect some \"junk\" history that some people seem to throw into the mixed reviews. Please, if you're going to try to add your own mish-mash of history, at least make sure it's correct.<br/><br/>That's right, I'm talking about you \"Russ-was-here\". Firstly, your review is off base on many levels, I'll try to answer some of those in a light hearted manner...<br/><br/>The fact that you consider Braveheart to be a \"factual\" representation of history is laughable, by this alone we can't take you seriously in your review of this movie. William Wallace wasn't running around the battlefield in a kilt, hate to break it to you.<br/><br/>You noted the wide variety of accents here. Is this shocking to you that actors from around the world took part in a movie, and that they all had different accents? The Pict language has been dead for quite some time, while there are rumors that the last confirmed speaker of Pict died in the 1950s, are we to expect the actors in this movie all speak ancient dialects of dead languages? get real (yes, that applies to Latin as well).<br/><br/>Perhaps your biggest mistake in assuming history of this movie is your statement: \"Then comes the fight scenes and complete absence of interesting Roman tactics, when attacked and flanked on a long narrow path they simply form a 1 man thick shield wall and wait...\" If you had actually studied Roman history (which I'm certain at this juncture you have not even cracked open a Tacitus or Pliny or Martial or any other Roman historian) then you would know the Battle of Teutoberg Wald quite well. In fact the battle that takes place in this movie is a near depiction of what the Germans did to the Romans when they destroyed 3 Roman legions while walking through the Black Forest. Ah yes, some of us actually DO study history. The Romans had no choice but to march nearly single file through a road, when they realized they were flanked on both sides (the line was 14 miles long, thus the battle took place over a 14 mile stretch) the Romans had no choice but to form up as best they could in the road. This proved devastating as it forced Romans to fight hand to hand combat against German soldiers who were more skilled in the area of hand to hand combat.<br/><br/>You mention that the Picts were known for their chariot warfare. Celts (Picts were a Celtic people) were well known for chariot warfare, as were many peoples in the Roman world, as you can see in this movie (especially the battle scene) using chariots would be quite a stupid move as they were in dense forest (use your brain, boy). As we can see with the final battle between Boudicca and Rome, using chariots was not always advantageous. In fact Boudicca sealed her army's fate by following an infantry charge with chariots (effectively crushing her infantry between Roman shields and Iceni chariots).<br/><br/>You also mention they fought naked. Indeed, many Indo Europeans fought in the buff, but that doesn't mean they all walked around in the buff all the time. They were dressed like Vikings you say? You have an odd preconceived notion of what the Vikings dressed like, personally I saw no Pict wearing chainmail (something Normans and Vikings were well known for). Furthermore it's a myth to believe that all Celts, Germans or any other Indo Europeans always fought naked. Many barbarian tribes were incredibly well equipped by 117AD as armor proved to be more and more of a necessity. We also see that Germanic and Celtic armor had a direct influence on Roman armor (Romans borrowed their helmet style from the Gauls for example). As for the movie? It's setting is in the winter, it would make no sense for Picts to be in the buff all the time. This is common sense.<br/><br/>Is this overkill? Yup. But I find your post to be (how did you put it?) completely devoid of historical facts. Does this movie have clichÃ©s of the time? Yup. Is the acting Oscar worthy? Probably not. Should we sit here and cry about it? nope. Just enjoy the movie. Nobody here is claiming this is a spitting image of 117AD in the northern UK (shocking, I know), but your post is ill informed and misleading.<br/><br/>Anyways, this is an entertaining movie and you certainly get the feel for the day. Engaging and exciting, certainly worth a view.",
    "Absolutely brilliant film. Those who criticise it for dealing with the subject of disabilty should look past the fact Will is disabled and look at the film in the light of what it aims to be, a touching, romance film. Emelia Clarke is great. Sam Claflin is brilliant. A definite must see film.",
    "After watching this movie I can say that no it is not as good as the original but that does mean that it is a bad movie. What I was really excited to see in this movie from the trailers was the scares and the demon nun Valak. The movie does not disappoint and can't wait to see the next entry in the conjuring series!",
    "This is a movie for everyone who ever felt like the little person, overlooked by those who were bigger or more popular. \"Rudy\" had kind of a lame title for a sports movie, and i remember the first time I saw a preview of it, I was totally moved and involved by the scenes and then guffawed aloud at the end when the announcer intoned, \"RUDY.\" That set the rest of the theater laughing too, so imagine my surprise when i saw it a couple months later and it was a 10 out of 10 in my book. I'm not even a sports fan but this movie got me. It shows the power of faith to get by with any frustration in life, the performances are great and it's a shame that Sean Astin had to wait eight years to get another great break with \"Lord of the Rings.\" His is a worldclass performance in this film, see it as it is one of the most inspiring films you'll ever see.",
    "I first wanted to see 'The Insider' because it professed to show the truth behind the lies of the Tobacco Industry. My wife and I saw it and were thoroughly impressed. In fact we've now seen it 5 times (I think, though I may have lost count).<br/><br/>If you go to the movies to be entertained mindlessly, do NOT see this movie, you will bored. This movie is for people who like to think, and who like to receive superior presentation of thought provoking material. The Insider has all that.<br/><br/>The movie gets you thinking about mankind. The obvious problem with human nature is obvious in this movie. The Tobacco companies knowingly selling addictive product, whilst claiming it is not. And then almost, almost but not quite, getting away with ruining an individual's life, an individual who's conscience was pricked by what they had seen.<br/><br/>But then it moves into the CBS drama, where again the hopelessness of mankind in general shines through. The strength of two individuals though manages to win the day, which is what makes this true story so unusual.<br/><br/>I found that (contrary to those who complained of the movies length) every scene that Mann has given us has a reason. A good reason. From the opening scenes depicting an evil far from USA. To the hints as to why we didn't hear anything about the drama when it happened, because the OJ murder story and media frenzy drowned out what should be to us all a much more serious matter.<br/><br/>For me the crowning moment in the film was when Russell Crowe (as Wigand) was about to dig into a hamburger when behind him on TV a newscaster reported findings about him, bad (though unfounded) findings. Crowe put his knife and fork back down in a way that told us all that he had no more appetite, in fact all the will left in him had been violently thrust away, thrust away by the selfish interests of the Tobacco companies.<br/><br/>All in all this is a complete movie that deserved its 7 nominations and should have gotten some awards. The sound was great, as was the camera work. If you love an artistic movie, you will love this one. Crowe is thoroughly believable and has cemented himself as a first rate actor, capable of playing just about any part put his way. Pacino is very well cast, Plummer is a class act, and a host of supporting cast did themselves proud.<br/><br/>What we can't forget about this movie, for all its drama, and for the pointed view it gives us of the nature we bear, its a TRUE STORY. Thats what really makes it shocking. And only those driven to the ends of despair and loneliness such as Wigand and Bergmann were, can really truly realise another fact pointed out in the movie, in the end of it all, we are nothing anyway, so what does it all matter?<br/><br/>See it!",
    "Really funny at at times really stupid, Ted is not only extremely well performed by its all-star cast and an extremely satirical and stupidly funny film, its script and direction is also impressive, the music and touch is perfect which all makes for a very watchable and humorous comedy, the movie does still repeat itself and does feel tiring and slow-moving at times.",
    "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.<br/><br/>But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.<br/><br/>I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date.",
    "One might argue Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is not a horror film, since it lacks almost everything you'll find in almost all of them: shock moments, vampires, werewolf, serial killers, even blood. The most graphic scene is a nightmare sequence that displays a rape scene so stylized it isn't actually disturbing. But one might also argue that Rosemary's Baby is a horror film in its purest form, since it doesn't depend on all those gimmicks to create its atmosphere. I prefer the latter point of view. <br/><br/>So what is happening in this film? Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move to a new apartment. Their neighbors are Roman and Minnie Castevet, an elderly couple. Although they are very friendly, there is something strange about them - the sounds that come from their apartment, the fact they remove all the pictures from their walls when the Woodhouses visit and other things like that. While Rosemary tries to keep a certain distance from them, Guy is very fond of the relationship to his new neighbors, and especially Minnie becomes more and more obtrusive, especially when Rosemary finds out she's pregnant - she recommends her another (better, as she says) gynecologist's and mixes a (healthy, as she says) herbal drink for her every day. <br/><br/>The pregnancy, however, develops rather unpleasant: Rosemary keeps feeling pain in her stomach and she becomes thinner (Pregnant women are supposed to gain, not lose weight, a visiting friend observes), and when the pain doesn't stop after several months, she begins to believe that her neighbors, her gynecologist's and even her husband conspired against her and want to harm the baby she's carrying. <br/><br/>All this is told by Roman Polanski in the perfect tone; the mood for the entire film is already set during the opening credits when we hear that weird lullaby, sung by Mia Farrow. And a lot of strange things happen throughout the entire film: Guy and Rosemary are told by Hutch, a friend of theirs, about the horrific past of the house they're now living in, a young girl that lives with the Castevets commits suicide (really a suicide?), Guy, an actor, gets the role he wanted so badly after the contestant who was originally supposed to play it turns blind, and Hutch, who might have found something out that would help Rosemary, suddenly is in a coma and dies three months later; all these (and a few other) events are precisely dosed by Polanski to draw us more and more into the film, while he makes sure on the other hand that the film doesn't become absurd. And he manages to give the film an ending that works, makes sense and is observant, slightly (but only slightly) funny and very disturbing, all at once. <br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby also contains two of the most memorable performances ever: Mia Farrow is haunting as Rosemary Woodhouse. She looks like she is physically suffering from her pregnancy and close to complete despair. And Ruth Gordon is amazing as the curious Minnie Castevet, always friendly, but also giving you the feeling that, hidden behind her generosity, she actually follows her own, obscure motives. If you have a helpful elderly female neighbor, you'll see her with other eyes once you've encountered Minnie Castevet. So, if you think a real horror film needs shock moments, vampires, werewolf, serial killers or at least blood - watch Rosemary's Baby and you'll change your mind.",
    "I often go see advance screenings in my area, especially now that I must officially be on \"the list\" as I am constantly finding tickets in my work inbox. This was the second Apatow production I've seen in advance and just like \"Superbad\", this did not disappoint. At the same time, while many of the cast members may be recognizable, there seems to be something different about this installment than I've seen in the likes of \"40 Year Old Virgin\", \"Superbad\", or \"Knocked Up\".<br/><br/>For starters, there was a definite presence of the \"TV actors on the big screen\" theme here, but I am pleased to report that Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis take to movies like naturals. Like many Apatow productions, Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter, proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Segel delivers a character we all know too well from our own personal experiences and never breaks role from the shocking beginning to appropriate ending. I even give Segel extra credit for not completely victimizing his character and pointing out apparent flaws on both ends of the ending relationship.<br/><br/>Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall, the iconic ex of the film, but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. From the beginning it is clear that her not-too-smart and shallow role of \"That 70s Show\" didn't follow her to \"Forgetting\"'s script. Kunis plays Racheal, a hospitality girl for the hotel that \"Forgetting\" takes place, and subsequently deals with Peter as he tries to get over Sarah Marshall. Her character is intelligent, charismatic, and appreciative of the good in people, a strong juxtaposition to the seemingly selfish starlet Sarah Marshall. Kunis owns the role with pride, even slipping in gestures and glances that didn't seem to initially be in the script. Hopefully this will open her up for more serious roles than \"American Psycho 2\" and the typecasting that often happens with TV actresses like her.<br/><br/>The star of the film, in my opinion, easily has to be Russell Brand, who plays the over-conscious over-sexed rock star Aldous Snow. Snow adds the necessary level of comedy that could have been missing from what is truly a tragic plot. About halfway in the film, I couldn't help but snicker to myself just with the presence that Brand creates (complete with perfect costume choices). The only downfall to a character who is truly the Mercutio of this tragedy is that Brand clearly overshadows Bell's performance as Sarah Marshall, who is ironically the most forgettable character of the film.<br/><br/>The writing flows with well-timed jokes, apathetic digs, and shocking vulgar humor. There is even a few moments where you feel Segel was digging on the cast with jokes involving crime dramas (Segel did time on \"CSI\") and TV actresses in horrible horror movies (Kunis did the atrocious \"American Psycho 2\"); not sure if it was intentional, but I caught what I thought was a reference. Just as with most Apatow productions, leave the kids at home. Unlike the rest, however, the crude humor doesn't overflow and turn off most audiences (like I noticed with \"Superbad\"). It also doesn't get very heavy in the least (which is what I felt hurt \"Knocked Up\"). I think Apatow has found a great balance with this production and Segel's script. I also want to give credit to Nicholas Stoller , who proved that he can be successful as a director after the hit he took from helping write \"Fun with Dick and Jane\".<br/><br/>All in all, this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. It keeps a consistently flowing script, unlike many recent comedies that seem to lose pace as they close the story. While crude, the jokes are just light enough to appease most adult audiences and the short 100 minute run time will ensure you won't be glancing at your watch waiting for it to end, just laughing hysterically.",
    "There are already 222 reviews of this movie, so the chances of anyone ever reading this are slim. However, I'm a sucker for a longshot. (so if you read this review, please give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down...I'm curious to know if anyone will ever read this, buried under more than 200 other reviews)<br/><br/>When a friend suggested we rent this movie, my initial reaction was, \"NO!! It's a chick flick. And besides, it's got Hugh Grant in it. Those are two really big strikes against it.\" However, and remember my fondness for longshots, the movie also casts Drew Barrymore in the other lead role. I couldn't resist.<br/><br/>To my complete surprise, both actors were excellent, and Hugh Grant doesn't have a bad singing voice. To be honest, if he and Drew Barrymore wanted to record an album of pop songs, I think it could do quite well. Her strength is that she is perky and funny, and that compensates for lack of trained vocal talent. Sometimes you DON'T want to hear Barbra Streisand.<br/><br/>Here's the quickie plot summary: Hugh Grant was in a popular band of the 1980s, and now he's reduced to playing for embarrassing venues like shopping malls, amusement parks, and High School reunions. When a Britney Spears-type singer wants him to write her new single, his life changes completely, but only due to Drew Barrymore's help.<br/><br/>I now judge movies in part by how my European friends would react to them. I have to admit that some American movies are a little corny, but this movie passed the test with flying colors. A friend from Slovakia not only loved the movie, he insisted on watching the trailers and special scenes.... twice! It was a welcome relief to actually be proud of a Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>I now have new-found respect for Hugh Grant, and my admiration for Drew Barrymore is higher than ever. She sure has a lot of talent for playing someone with pluck and a little bit of endearing wackiness.",
    "Finally, a horror film about adults. Adults with complex issues and children that act like children and not hyper precocious sex models. The reason to see this film isn't to find out the over advertised \" Esther's secret\" of the film (a MAJOR misstep in marketing. Too many people now enter the film trying to figure out the \"secret\" before they normally would have been surprised), but rather to see a well-acted (extremely well acted by Vera F.)slow-building suspense story with excellent direction and cinematography. John Ottman's score also serves the film well, without becoming overpowering in signaling this is a \"creepy\" film. The actress who plays Esther shows a skill in performance that makes one think we may actually have another Jodie Foster to keep an eye on. This film works because we LIKE the characters (Rob Zombie please take note!) and fear for them and their survival. Dark Castle's best film, and it gives one hope that the horror/suspense genre still can be presented with intelligence and depth. Hollywood take note: we don't want a xerox of this film, but we do want more films that share this films strenghts: good script, likable real characters, excellent acting and nice, tension building direction.",
    "Closer: A<br/><br/>Mike Nichols delivers his best work yet. CLOSER is a well crafted dissertation on art's reflection of the human condition, particularly the dependence on romantic relationships. It delivers an intimate film that actually achieves depths rarely seen on screen. Kubrick's Eye's Wide Shut only scratched the surface of literal naked lies that represent sexual game-playing on screen. His work came off as a freshman treatise on relationships in a pervy, self-obsessed way. Nichols and screenwriter Patrick Marber deliver a full and rich study on the difficulties of love and sexual tension. Without ever showing a sex scene on screen they are able to portray the nasty nature of jealously, lust and obsession without actually exploiting these acts as Kubrick and countless others have done. The result is a pure _expression of the realization that we don't know anything when it comes to assessing truth in character. <br/><br/>Alice (Natalie Portman), a former stripper, is hit by a car in London as she forgets to look right. Dan (Jude Law) comes to her rescue and guides her to the hospital before guiding her into his life. Dan writes obituaries but soon finds a novel in himself thanks to Alice. While shooting the photo for his book he falls for the photographer Anna (Julie Roberts) who pulls back from him given that he's with Alice. For light-style revenge Dan sets up Larry (Clive Owen) in an Internet sex chat room to meet Anna thinking this will embarrass him and her. Cupid backfires thus throwing Larry and Anna into a relationship of their own. First impressions, like all art, can only show you broad strokes of character like stereotypes and lies. Alice is presented as a young girl in need of saving, literally. Anna is a strong, independent artist who seems smart in her career and choices. Dan is a struggling, sensitive writer in search of a muse, someone to inspire and rescue. Larry is a sex obsessed dermatologist and self-described caveman. By the end of the film, however, the audience will get a deeper and more profound view of all four characters and realize we just don't know them as well as we think. <br/><br/>Acknowledging that film can be art, the screenwriter is skilled with dialog that reflects the illusionary quality that is art. Every piece of conversation, every word has meaning, reflection and sometimes foreboding for what is to come and the gaps in story and exposition brilliantly leads the audience to fill in those elements with their own interpretations. It is those interpretations and broad-stroke impressions that the film is there to question. Alice, in the scene at Anna's photo exhibit, discusses this very concept to Larry when discussing her reaction to the photos and the show. The function is just a big lie, the glossy photos of people's faces don't' show the real person, the fancy people at the party only reflect that same quality. Everything is for surface show - one-dimensional illusions of character. Alice, Anna, Dan and Larry are those photos just in moving form but that makes all the difference. The movement and editing of the film allows us to jump through months and years of their relationships to unpeel parts of the illusion of character and stereotypes. We can explore wrong assumptions about characters and that should make us explore the real-world difficulties of knowing people, really knowing them and not just their image or attitude. Many will just see this film as a sad story of four wounded people making bad relationship choices. This is really sad because this film is truly a great wake-up call to humanity to embrace a new approach and attitude about art and people. Strength can be a weakness. Vulnerability can be empowering. Dependence can be comforting. Nothing can be valued or viewed without bias and prejudice. Great art, like this film, can sometimes achieve a new way to show us how wrong we can be when we let our bias prevent us from just experiencing life and being open to shifts in perception. So take a closer look, at this film and the life around you. You just might find happiness in walking away from the expected.",
    "The human dimension of this film touched me. Some of these things touched me to tears. I list a few of them.<br/><br/>1. The job of the professionals who prepares the dead for their last contact with the family (wake) and their passage to eternity (cremation). In the film, the characters who perform this job, teach the spectator a true ritual of respect and affection with the dead. \"Respect and affection with the dead\": feelings that the modern life tries to banish from its practices. In the modern world, the dead are inconvenient and dispatched quickly in funerals where the majority of those who are present, entertain themselves with parallel talks, instead of focusing on the reason why they are there.<br/><br/>2. The nobility and grandeur of this job that, in the film, is not associated with any religion, and is directly associated with dealing with human beings. This nobility and grandeur reflects also on to the dead, in the sense that it reminds us that the dead deserve our respect and affection, because a new stage of our relationship with them is starting.<br/><br/>3.The way Daigo grows, as he learns this job, and overcomes (i)the social stigma that society imposes upon the contact with the dead and, also, the people who have contact with the dead, as well as (ii) his personal repulsion with repulsive material aspects of death (odors, rot, etc.)<br/><br/>4. The way Daigo grows, as he incorporates the nobility and grandeur of the job he was forced to do because of the circumstances (he was jobless because the orchestra where he played cello was dismissed). And, when his wife discovers in what consists his job, and tries to force him to quit, he has grown so much that he chooses to keep the job instead to yield to his wife menaces.<br/><br/>5. The way Daigo grows and which leads him back to play the cello and celebrate life more than ever, playing outdoors and playing at home as he used to do when he was a boy.<br/><br/>6. The way Daigo wife grows when she has the opportunity to look close to the job of her husband, and begins to admire him and love him more. Wife who have the opportunity to convince Daigo to take care of his dead father, when Daigo runs away when he gets aware of his father death. Wife, who, when the opportunity showed up, says with pride to the individuals of the funeral, that were almost doing a dirty job with the deceased Daigo father, \"my husband will take care of him, he is a professional\"<br/><br/>7. The way Daigo grows when he encounter again the love for his father and forgive him for having abandoned the family, while he prepares his old man for the burial.<br/><br/>8. How death can be seen as part of life process, when it causes some people to become aware of how much love they missed, and how much they have been loved without being aware of it.<br/><br/>All this happens because Daigo goes back to his hometown, a small town. That is, the return to his origins helps to renew the ties with the traditions and helps the character to put himself together again.<br/><br/>I'm omitting many precious details that appear throughout the film. These details must be seen personally, because the film was made with great sensitivity and expertise, and deserves to be seen.<br/><br/>Roland.",
    "Army of Darkness (1992) is in my opinion by far the best one of the \"Evil Dead\" trilogy! It is my second favorite film of the trilogy, I just love, love this movie to death!!!! It is my personal favorite horror movie in the Evil Dead series. The best one is the theatrical cut the rest versions are pure crap with lameness. The original cut kicks ass!!! Great movie! This movie is so silly, that it's actually funny. <br/><br/>I have always loved Army of Darkness and I always will. I love this film to death!!!! I was watching with my dad this film and even he loved it. So yes I proud to say I love this film and I have enjoyed More than the original The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987)! This film has funny moments, balance, smart genius creativity, great babes, mystic forces and mystic knights in it.<br/><br/>Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun. <br/><br/>Army of the dead who were actually skeletons were fabulous, the fights were awesome and they and they were highly enjoyable. The film was fast paced from the beginning till the end. I am sorry if you guys love Evil Dead 2 much better than this film, I just love Army of Darkness much better, this film is just a great worthy sequel to their predecessors. Ash is like ably hero on screen and he is one of the most popular hero's till it's days. Army of Darkness is a classic. Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, & the special effects masters KNB! You cant ask for more. Great story, funny lines, fantastic looking monsters. I don't care what anyone says I just love this film to death!!! <br/><br/>What we get in here is a hybrid of sorts with Bruce Campbell once again as Ash the reluctant hero fighting ghouls and goblins (well maybe not goblins) in the medieval times. This third chapter goes for more of the laughs rather then the scares and actually offers up a fun take on the genre mix director Sam Raimi tells. The movie is not as annoying as the previous 2 films and closes out the trilogy nicely. They are a lot of talks of an Army of Darkness 2 and I don't want any sequel to this horror/comedy flick. I thought this film closed the trilogy beautiful. There is a lots of comic relief, over the top cuts, BOOMSTICK!!!!! <br/><br/>Army of Darkness is my second favorite movie (Evil Dead II, Dark Knight, ARMY OF DARKNESS) and here's why. It follows the character of Ashley (Ash) J. Williams in his journey to the past that is far better explained in Evil Dead II. He is only able to be sent back to his own time (and his job at S Mart) if he finds the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) which will also free the people who can help him from the attacks of the deadites. Ash has to find the book, get the babe, fight some demons, and get back home...like in the deal. This movie has it all, and some sugar, baby! It is a hilarious, gory, wonderful display of Bruce Campbell's ingenious acting ability, and anyone who says differently is a deadite. It's a film that would make Clive Barker proud. An oddball yet absolutely successful pairing of slapstick Comedy and undead Horror with a medieval setting thrown into the mix for good measure, 1992's Army of Darkness sits proudly near the top of the list of most unconventional yet absolutely entertaining motion pictures in history. Following up on 1981's oft-banned The Evil Dead and 1987's The Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn (itself a Horror-Comedy hybrid), Army of Darkness represents the most accessible and audience-friendly of the three. Special effects; gore; humor; and of course, Bruce Campbell's over-the-top antics are Awesome!!! Hail to the king, baby.<br/><br/>Army of Darkness is a 1992 American dark fantasy action comedy film directed by Sam Raimi. It is the third installment of the Evil Dead franchise. The film was written by Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan, produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell (also acting as co-producer) and Embeth Davidtz. Continuing from Evil Dead II, Ash Williams (Campbell) is trapped in the Middle Ages and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.<br/><br/>Beyond in human flesh, inked in blood-and amazingly hard to pronounce-the ancient \"Necronomicon\" (Book of the Dead) unleashes unspeakable evil upon mankind in director Sam Raimi's (Spider-Man) outrageously hilarious sword-and-sorcery epic. Back to do battle with the hideous \"Deadites,\" Bruce Campbell reprises his role from the Evil Dead series as Ash, the handsome, shotgun-toting, chainsaw-armed department store clerk from S-Mart's housewares division. Demonic forces time warp him-and his '73 Oldsmobile-into England's Dark Ages, where he romances a beauty (Embeth Davidtz) and faces legions of undead beasts, including a ghastly army of skeletons. Can Ash save the living from the dead, rescue his girlfriend and get back to his own time? This movie is personal second favorite movie it is 10/10.",
    "In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:<br/><br/>First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: \nIs Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?<br/><br/>Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.<br/><br/>During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.<br/><br/>Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.",
    "Quentin Tarantino looks like he just might follow through with his threat to make the ultimate \"guys on a mission movie\" if he gets his 'Inglorious Bastards' on to the big screen, but he'll be pushed to equal 'The Dirty Dozen', the quintessential movie in the genre. 35 years on and it's still one of the best WW2 adventure movies, and a strong contender for the ultimate guys movie. It shouldn't be taken too seriously - I don't think anyone is going to argue it's a realistic depiction of war - but it's still one of the most entertaining movies around, and it's impressive collection of tough guys and character actors is really hard to beat. Director Aldrich had previously made the classic noir 'Kiss Me Deadly' (starring Ralph Meeker who reappears here in a supporting role) and the wonderfully creepy 'Whatever Happened To Baby Jane', but this is arguably going to be THE movie he's remembered for. Screen legend Lee Marvin ('Point Blank', 'The Killers') with the assistance of his Sgt (Richard Jaeckel), must train a motley collection of criminal and misfits (including John Cassavetes, Jim Brown, Telly Savalas, Charles Bronson, Clint Walker and Donald Sutherland), for a suicide mission behind enemy lines. Marvin is just great, extremely cool and charismatic, but also a fine actor, something which is often overlooked. The ensemble cast (which also includes George Kennedy, and two future stars of 'The Wild Bunch', Ernest Borgnine and Robert Ryan) are uniformly excellent, but Cassavetes is particularly outstanding, Sutherland is memorable as a half wit, and Savalas is unforgettable as the religious psychopath Maggott. 'The Dirty Dozen' is first class entertainment and highly recommended. It put 90% of today's \"action movies\" to shame!",
    "A stunning performance by Denzel Washington (Oscar-nominated) carries this film literally into cinematic excellence. He stars as the titled character, the controversial Black Nationalist Leader who is easily one of the most interesting people who lived during the 20th Century. Spike Lee's uncompromising direction focuses on X's life. From his very early childhood to his violent death, the audience is given lots and lots information on the character as the film runs about 195 minutes. A good supporting cast helps, but this is Washington's show from the very start. His performance is very dominant and this is easily one of the best jobs that was never honored with an Academy Award. Brilliant biopic. 5 stars out of 5.",
    "Based on the recent Marie-Antoinette biography by Antonia Fraser, Sofia Coppola's film focuses on the personal qualities of the character of Marie-Antoinette and thus participates in the character's historical rehabilitation. Antoinette is seen as a respectful loyal daughter, a loving mother, a patient wife, who had to withstand a flood of vindictive criticism since the moment she set foot in the French court. This depiction contrasts strongly with many prior representations of the character in film (\"The Affair of the Necklace\" for example), which show her as superficial, selfish and vain.<br/><br/>The visuals and auditory elements, which evoke a powerful image of 18th-century Versailles, are the movie's forte. And their effects linger in one's mind (or at least they did in mine) long after one's exit from the theater. As a budding art historian, I was stunned by the intensely lush visual spectacle the film has to offer: the pomp and circumstance of ritualized and regimented 18th-century Versailles. The semi-private world that Antoinette builds for herself to escape Versailles's codified, quasi-totalitarian atmosphere, is evoked through a sequence of fast-moving images of champagne-guzzling, beautifully-decorated cake-eating, and Manolo Blahnik shoe buying. Thus Antoinette's fantasy world is likened to a world recognizable to you, me and Carrie Bradshaw. Some people may scoff at this 21st century world transposed to an earlier time. But as the center of the world in 18th-century Europe, Marie-Antoinette's \"secret Versailles\" would certainly have been as \"hip\" as this, and Coppola has found effective means through sound and image by which to make this hipness accessible.<br/><br/>The story zooms in on the character of Marie-Antoinette, played by a ravishing Kirsten Dunst, who arrives at Versailles at the tender age of 14, to become queen of France a mere 5 years later. Coppola emphasizes the loneliness of Antoinette throughout the film: most important is her alienation from the French court by the fact that she is a foreigner (something that made her a scapegoat for all of France's problems during the 1780's). Her powerlessness to \"fit in\" is emphasized also through her sexual alienation from her socially-awkward husband (played by Jason Schwartzmann), her mother's chidings that she has not yet produced an heir to the French throne (and thereby has not secured Austria's political place in Europe), and the bitchy gossip that goes on behind her back at court.<br/><br/>Marie-Antoinette is depicted as an intensely personable, friendly and playful person. Coppola fashions a Marie-Antoinette who is a dutiful daughter, a patient wife to Louis (who eventually overcomes his shyness and becomes a loving and protective husband and father), and a caring and tender mother. She is shown as both bold and humble, two qualities which had quasi-miraculous effects on both the court and the angry mob, as is shown in some of the film's most touching moments.<br/><br/>Equipped with these \"essential\" personal qualities, the charges traditionally made against Marie-Antoinette fade completely. It is precisely Antoinette's ill-fated attempt at fitting into French court society that causes her escape into a world of idle futility and libertinage. Her escape into the world of \"playing shepherdess\" in her pleasure-house of Le Hameau is shown not as a silly escape from responsibility but as the simple human need to be surrounded by the natural world. This place appears to us as it does to Antoinette: as a refuge from the backbiting, totalitarian regime of Versailles. Even the legendary \"let them eat cake\" statement allegedly made by Marie-Antoinette is discarded as fiction.<br/><br/>There is almost no place in the film for the 18th-century reality as it existed outside the bubble-like world of Versailles. This is not the movie's purpose. The end of the film is a bit abrupt: the last image shows the royal family heading to Paris to be imprisoned in the building of the Conciergerie. There is no mention of the guillotine anywhere, which again can seem surprising, but which shows that Coppola deliberately tried to eschew stereotypes and do something different. And it is all to her credit.",
    "I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as \"one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles\" and \"one of the classics of the 70's\". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a \"crazy house\" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.<br/><br/>What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.<br/><br/>-10/10",
    "At only 29 years of age and in only his second major studio release, Stanley Kubrick showed the world that he was a force to be reckoned with. By the time he died 42 years later his films were epochal events waited for breathlessly by his large band of devotees who considered him a director without equal. He seldom disappointed them.<br/><br/>This movie is set in World War I amidst the incredibly destructive and futile trench warfare between France and Germany. Kirk Douglas plays Frenchman Colonel Dax, who is ordered to make an impossible assault on a heavily-fortified enemy position. The only reason this charge is being made is that his commanding general, played by George Macready, believes that capturing the position will earn him a promotion. When the assault does not go forward under heavy enemy bombardment, the general is infuriated and demands that three men be arbitrarily chosen to stand trial for cowardice, an offense punishable by death. Col. Dax defends these men at their court-martial.<br/><br/>The battle and trial scenes are about as good as have ever been filmed and the high level of tension is sustained throughout the movie. After the film's climax has occurred, Col. Dax goes looking for his troops and finds them relaxing at a cafe. What he and the viewer witness there is possibly the most affecting scene I've ever seen on screen.<br/><br/>Looking at this film in perspective, it's easy to see Kubrick's trademarks even at this early stage of his career. The attention to the composition of his shots reflects his background as a still photographer and foreshadows his other great films to come. I find myself most impressed today with the way he could handle a dramatic story like this one without any innovative techniques or unusual special effects to hide behind, then turn around and make such totally different films like '2001...' and 'Dr. Strangelove...' Other films like 'The Shining' and 'Barry Lyndon' combined a strong story line with breakthrough film techniques. His versatility astonishes me.<br/><br/>Adolphe Menjou also stars as the general who convinces Dax's superior officer to risk the ill-fated charge. Ralph Meeker, Timothy Carey and Joe Turkel give strong performances as the men on trial. Turkel turns up 23 years later in another Kubrick film, 'The Shining,' playing the bartender.<br/><br/>You can take your pick: 'Paths of Glory' can rightly be described as one of the greatest war movies of all, or one of the great anti-war films, or as one of Kubrick's best. Or simply one of the best, period.",
    "I must say, no signs of aging. Embedded in its day and yet totally relevant. Perhaps the most entertaining of all of Hitchcock's films. Marriage is the theme and murder is the hook. James Stewart is as perfect as he's ever been. He uses the contradictions of his character to create someone immediately familiar. Thelma Ritter's practicality includes a rant about the destructive effect of intelligence. Grace Kelly enters the scene like a character in a dream. She remains a sort of dream that's why to see her climb the killer's balcony is one of my most cherished film memories. If you haven't seen the film you may think I'm rambling but if you have, you know exactly what I mean, don't you?",
    "I watched this again last night. I had forgotten just how beautifully done it was - both a character study of two very different men and a gripping plot of their attempts to succeed - partly through athletics. the writer and director so well convey both Cambridge and the Edinburgh Presbyterian missionary disciples, in the early 1920s so very well.<br/><br/>The acting is superb - I had never seen a character presented like Eric Liddell in movies - how fine Ian Charleson was in this role, the softness of his voice, his ease and joy in running competitively (especially in contrast with the tense tortured Harold Abrahams). I also loved the more supporting roles - I've read a biography of F.E. Smith and Nigel Davenport is exactly how I would imagine him. The actor who played the Prince of Wales also seemed exactly right with his effortless charm, looks, and lack of imagination. Ian Holm, John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson - all wonderful.<br/><br/>The actors weren't chosen for glamour either - Liddell and Abrahams are not Leni Riefenstahl images of athletic ideals, Liddell's sister is no beauty - and Abrahams' girlfriend is pretty but not stunning. It made them seem more real. (In nice contrast were the near-pretty boy looks of Nigel Havers as Lord Lindsay - it so suited his character).<br/><br/>The races are riveting - partly due to the music and sound effects.<br/><br/>So many small things are done so well - e.g., when Lord Lindsay has the confidence of his class to barge into a room containing the Prince of Wales, and three other lords (including Birkenhead and the head of the British Olympic Committee) and greets them by name - no need for introduction there (as there was for Liddell). It's small but seems quite real.<br/><br/>As an American, it was interesting and funny to see our Olympic team shown as the numerous, ominous, invulnerable \"other\"! (something like watching a Rocky movie with Rocky as the product of a Russian or East German success machine!). In fact, the one scene that seemed a bit off was the scene of the American track athletes warming up for the Games - all heavy music, machine like athletes, ferocious coach yelling with a megaphone into people's ears. It pounded too hard on the \"these are the scary almighty inhuman opponents\" theme in contrast to the cheerful British boys running along the beach.<br/><br/>Something I had forgotten about the movie was how stubborn BOTH protagonists are - Liddell fully as much as Abrahams. Liddell is not overly deferential or bashful when dealing with the Prince of Wales - but instead straightforward and very firm. <br/><br/>I truly can't understand anyone not liking this movie - it is very exciting even on the basic level of \"will they win?\" and so much more. (For example, Ian Holm's character's reaction to success after 30 years is very moving). Those who write to say that \"Reds\" deserved the Oscar more - are simply wrong. (Reds was so simplistic that it felt like watching the movie \"The Hardy Boys Go to the Russian Revolution\"). Those who say they cannot differentiate among the boys or between the Scottish and English accents - well, it sounds like some political statement to me. <br/><br/>Do watch it - it's very fine, very moving, very exciting.",
    "No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in \"10 Rillington Place\" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in \"American Psycho\". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "What's interesting to me is the deeper meaning and symbols of the film. The film is really about two women. Sarah, and her friend, Juno. The film opens with Sarah losing both her husband and child in a horrific wreck. Over the course of the movie, it becomes apparent that the accident was caused because the husband was distracted and upset over an affair he was having with Juno. Sarah is aware, at least subconsciously, of Juno's betrayal and that it lead to the deaths of her husband and child. She is not in a place mentally or emotionally to acknowledge it on a conscious level. When Sarah awakens from the wreck, there is a sequence where she runs from darkness. The darkness symbolizes a call to action. Sarah rejects it by running from it. She isn't ready yet. This is classically what chase dreams are about. The dreamer is being pursued by their subconscious given horrible form. If the dreamer can make a conscious effort to stop running and speak to the scary thing chasing them, that dreamer's unconscious will speak directly to the dreamer. This would be the conscious (dreamer) dropping the ego defense (running) and interacting with the subconscious (chaser) to gain new insight.<br/><br/>A year passes and Juno get all the friends together to go spelunking. She lies and takes them to a cave she has discovered because she wants Sarah and her to be the ones who find the cave complex and name it. In Juno's sick mind, she's trying to perform some type of penance. She doesn't see that she's manipulating her friends to do something incredibly dangerous. Juno is a manipulator who only sees things from her own narcissistic point of view. Other people are only as real as Juno feels about them.<br/><br/>Going underground is dream imagery for going into the subconscious. This could be going into a basement under a bar as in Fight Club or even underwater.<br/><br/>Sarah is returning to the darkness that she ran from earlier. She starts to experience hallucinations (waking dreams) mainly her daughter's laugh. Her subconscious is pulling her back to the event that damaged her psyche (the wreck).<br/><br/>They get trapped and so must go deeper into the cave to find a way out. Thus Sarah is going deeper and deeper into her subconscious. It's not readily apparent but it's when they get to the deepest point of the caves (the deepest level of consciousness) that they actually encounter the cave people. If you watch you'll notice that they stop traveling downward (they may fall or are be pushed downward but the never choose to go down). Thus the cave people are the most base and ancient level of Sarah's mind. They lack all their senses. They have no problem-solving or tool-using skills but they are very strong and aggressive. They are a primal force.<br/><br/>While down with these creatures, several key events happen. The first is that Juno and Sarah's friends began to be picked off. The second is Juno's true character is revealed. She stabs one of her friends (accident) but then leaves rather then helps her (because of shock but on purpose). What's interesting is that as soon as Juno reunites with the main group, she makes a big show about she won't leave without Sarah who is missing. She acts differently when people are around. Character is what you do when others aren't watching. Juno is a person of weak character.<br/><br/>The biggest key event is that Sarah is separated from the group and ends up in the den of the cave dwellers. The heart of this lowest level of her subconscious. It is here that Juno's original betrayal becomes fully known to Sarah's conscious self. The friend that Juno stabbed is bleeding to death and tells Sarah of Juno and her husband. It's at this lowest level that Sarah understands Juno. Juno is the type of woman that would wreck the marriage of a good friend, stab a friend and leave them to die alone, and lead all her friends to certain death because of an ego trip. In short, Juno is a destructive force. Sarah kills her hurt friend to end her suffering. This is the action that Juno refused. Sarah empathized with her friend and refused to leave her in pain to make her escape. Juno did not do this. Juno felt that her feelings and safety were more important than her friend's suffering.<br/><br/>The other event that happens in this room, is that Sarah kills a cave dweller child and observes it's mother grieving over the loss. Sarah has now committed the same sin as Juno. The mother tries to kill Sarah. This is what is missing from Sarah's life. Sarah needs to take vengeance on Juno to become whole.<br/><br/>Sarah eventually meets up with Juno again and they began to make their way out as the last two survivors. After the last big fight against the cave dwellers, Sarah confronts Juno about her lies, manipulations, and betrayals. Then, Sarah stabs Juno in the leg and leaves her for the cave dwellers. This the same action Juno took earlier when she stabbed her friend and left her. What is different is that Sarah makes a conscious choice to kill Juno and takes responsibility for the action where Juno avoids the responsibility of everything she has done.<br/><br/>Then there is a long sequence where Sarah is climbing upward out of the dark to the light. This is symbolic of a return to consciousness and the real world.<br/><br/>This movie has parallels with Hamlet. What is missing from Sarah is what was missing from Hamlet. They both need to take action but because of the horribleness of the action they must take, they have recoiled from it and spend the whole story getting to a point where they come to terms with what they must do to be whole.",
    "It's funny, but I notice most of the prior comments are from guys, but speaking as a woman, this is by no means just a guy's flick. It's been one of my favorite films since the day it came out. It's got everything- drama, romance, action, and an honest to goodness story. There are even interesting themes, like the moral dilemma that Wyatt finds himself in-- Is he compelled to help fight the Cowboys even though he's \"retired\" and just wants to live out his life in peace? Is there a moral equivalence between killing for justice and killing for retribution? How far can a man go to sacrifice his own integrity and better judgment? Even though the Earps are the \"good guys\", the movie doesn't glamorize violence. Doc Holliday and some of the Earps' other sidekicks (\"Creek Johnson\" and \"Texas Jack\") are obviously pretty shady characters, but at the end of the day, are forced to choose between right and wrong, and they choose correctly. It doesn't get much better than Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, and I can't for the life of me understand why he didn't get nominated for it. I also appreciate the fact that the love story between Wyatt and Josephine didn't dominate the film and take away from the real plot, ala \"Titanic\". The love story simply served its purpose in helping viewers to better understand the character of Wyatt. Also the friendship between Wyatt and Doc was portrayed tenderly but not wussily. And okay, as a woman, let me just say that there is no one sexier than Sam Elliot. Man alive, if there ever was a person born to portray a cowboy, that guy is IT. If you've never seen a Western, or are not a fan, try this movie. It will make a believer out of you.",
    "Having never played the game I didn't know much about what the plot was about but the games were big hits and popular enough to make a live action movie so I eventually gave it a watch and was very surprised, The story is very loyal to the games from what I seen in the games, Some nice action scenes and good effects, I didn't like the choice of actors but they did ok, As far as game to movies go it's probably one of the better ones, Even if it won't stand the test of time (No pun intended) I think maybe it could of been better if it wasn't made by Disney as they like to tone films down so much that if you're over the age of 11 it's not as enjoyable, But it could of been much worse so I can't complain too much, A good family film that is easy to watch even if you haven't played any of the games.",
    "In this journey through the struggles and trials that single father, Chris Gardner, has to take, you see the real side of hardwork and integrity. Chris Gardner, played by Will Smith, Is just trying to give his son a good home as he's on the pursuit of happiness. This movie doesn't only show the hard work of a single parent, but it shows that no matter how hard you get pushed down, you should always get up and keep going. I love the strong connection that the father and son roles have in this movie, it seems so real, and that's because it is! The father (Will smith) and son (Jaden Smith) are father and son outside the movie realm too. Actor, Will Smith, shows his true emotional side during this film, as if he was actually going through the situations occurring in the movie. There couldn't have been a better cast picked for this movie, the pain, struggle, love, and hope seem so real as if you're watching a documentary on someone's life. Smith, usually looked at as a comedic actor, shows what he can really do by jerking the tears from the audience's eyes.",
    "Bacheha-Ye aseman (Children of Heaven)<br/><br/>It was with some trepidation that I popped this DVD into the player - it was, after all, my first venture into Iranian cinema, so I was a little unsure what to expect. I am used to, and for the most part, enjoy foreign films. They open up an incredible world of cinema that one would otherwise miss. After five minutes, it was fairly evident that this film was something a bit special. The story is simple. While at market shopping, Ali loses his sisters school shoes. After desperately trying in vain to find them, he decides that he and his sister will share his sneakers, meeting her after to school each day to recover them from her, in order to get to school himself. That is pretty much a synopsis of the entire movie. It doesn't end there however...<br/><br/>This film is played with such beauty and innocence; it is a true pleasure to watch. Mohammad Amir Naji plays Ali with such incredible depth and passion, one is completely drawn into his plight. From the start of the film, we see the relationship between brother and sister, played with equal warmth by Bahare Seddiqi, strained as he explains how he lost her shoes. The sorrow on Ali's face, and Zahra's tears at the news, are truly heartbreaking to watch. The expressions on the faces of the children are so genuine, it is clear that spending a cinematic hour and half will be a pleasure, albeit not an easy one.<br/><br/>We see Ali and his Father looking for work as gardeners. From the outset it is clear that Ali's Father is strict, but it is also evident he loves his son dearly, and the simple exchange of smiles as they find their first job is heart-warming, and totally believable. Cycling through the city, it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. We are watching a boy, to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes, riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones, into rural areas where houses with swimming pools, ornate architecture and luxury are rife.<br/><br/>There is so much in Western civilisation that we take for granted. What to us are simple daily belongings to others is pure decadence. Aside from anything else, this film is a window into a world so many of us do not understand. Simple things bring Ali pleasure, blowing bubbles, swinging on swings with his new found friend, the smiles and laughter of the children is absorbing.<br/><br/>Later in the film we see Ali enter a race in order to win a pair of brand new sneakers for his sister. To win them, he must come third. Again we see the division of wealth, as Ali races through the streets, the thoughts and images of his sister swirling in his head, and on screen, while at the same time, parents of other children film the race on camcorders, all the time Ali running, fighting for the shoes he needs so desperately.<br/><br/>The film is directed perfectly, and the credit for this goes to Majid Majidi, whose films have won acclaim worldwide. There are no special effects, no luxurious settings. There are times when the film feels like a documentary in the direction, and that works in its favour.  This film would make an excellent introduction into the world of foreign cinema. Throughout the movie, the expressions and emotions displayed by the children speak far louder than any dialogue ever could.<br/><br/>The film is not dialogue intensive, and one could easily watch the film, and understand the story, even without the aid of subtitles. This film was nominated for an Academy Award, and it not difficult to see why. Ignoring for a moment the subtitles and language barriers, since they are not overly crucial to the film, this is a story of true innocence, and tugs hard at the heartstrings, sometimes to breaking point. The portrayal of the children is gentle, warm and absolutely believable, and one cannot help but be drawn into this tale, as it gently unwinds. It is sometimes tough to watch the emotions played out, but ultimately, worth every second.<br/><br/>Missing this film, particularly if simply put off by the fact it is foreign language, would a sad deprivation of the senses and the heart. It is not just a film, it is an experience, and one that is completely passionate, and totally unforgettable.<br/><br/>I truly cannot recommend this highly enough. It is widely available on DVD or VHS - rent it, borrow it or buy it - you will be glad that you did!<br/><br/>Reviewed by Ollie",

    "I have to say I didn't expect this. I didn't have great expectations when I saw this. Especially considering the cold reception given to it by critics and audiences alike. But it is one of the most original Hollywood thrillers ever.<br/><br/>The story is about an investment banker named Nicholas Van Orton(Michael Douglas in one of his best roles) who is greedy and self centred and who lives alone in his huge mansion. His brother(Sean Penn) gives him a card telling him to contact the company and it is his birthday present to him. What follows is absolute edge of the seat stuff and it shows David fincher at a time when he made some of the finest movies ever seen in Hollywood. In the midst of all this, he meets a waitress named Christine. Revealing more might spoil the movie for you as it is a fun roller-coaster ride with many twists and turns.<br/><br/>What impressed me about this movie was the atmosphere throughout the movie. It is classic David fincher with the dark tone and great background music. The camera work is excellent especially in the scene where his father falls down to his death. These scenes also show another side to Nicholas van orton and indicate why he became the way he is. He starts out as a one dimensional guy but then when faced with crisis he shows so many sides. I feel the game is more a character study because it shows the myriad changes in his behaviour throughout the movie. Rather than depending on gimmicky twists and quick editing(which is the popular way of making movies today), The Game depends solely on atmosphere and the strength of its performances. Deborah Kara Unger gives a great performance as a character with shades of grey. She is the perfect person for this character with her mysterious look. Sean penn as usual gives a great performance but unfortunately he doesn't have much screen time.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie is the dark humor. Michael Douglas gives certain comments with a deadpan delivery that makes it even more humorous. In many ways the Game can be described as a satire on society and how people forget the most important things in life when pursuing success. It is interesting how facing a crisis brings out the most basic emotions in people and how it changes people is the basic theme of this movie. We experience the same emotions as Nicholas and thus it becomes a ride where we don't know the truth till the last moment.<br/><br/>I had tears in my eyes at the end and the credit should go to the direction and the music. The slow motion sequence at the end is also well done and this has got to be one of the best endings of all time.<br/><br/>10/10",
    "Many people were disappointed with 'Jackie Brown' when it was first released as it didn't live up to their expectations created by the more flamboyant 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I admit that I was one of those disappointed fans. But as the years have gone by I have come to appreciate this movie more and more, and if you deal with what it IS and not what you thought it was going to be, you'll see that it is an underrated gem of a movie. 'Jackie Brown' is much more character driven and leisurely plotted than Tarantino's previous two movies. I haven't read the Elmore Leonard novel on which it was based so I can't tell whether this was a conscious decision by Tarantino himself, or it's because of the source material, but it might be a stumbling block for those with MTV-style attention spans. 1970s crime movie buffs will find it much easier going. The big names in the cast like De Niro, Jackson and Fonda are all very good, but the real standout performances in this movie are by 70s blaxploitation icon Pam Grier ('Coffy', 'Foxy Brown', 'Black Mama White Mama',etc.etc.) and a revelatory one from Robert Forster. Forster back in the day showed plenty of promise in movies like 'Medium Cool' but quickly found himself stuck in b-grade exploitation movies like 'Vigilante' and 'Alligator'. Fun stuff, but hardly Oscar material. Max Cherry is the best role he has ever been given, and he is superb in it. The fascinating thing about 'Jackie Brown' for me is that Tarantino's critics accuse him of making shallow and violent self-consciously hip crime films, but the central story of this movie concerns an inter-racial Middle Aged romance, something I haven't seen done in a believable or realistic fashion by Hollywood before. By doing this so well Tarantino shows he has much more depth, and is a much more interesting and braver film maker than his more acclaimed contemporaries. 'Jackie Brown' is a fine movie that hopefully one day will get the kudos it deserves. Don't overlook this one just because it isn't 'Pulp Fiction The Next Generation'!",
    "Resident Evil: Afterlife attempts to take the series back to basics and delivers a campy action film that has fun with the material. In this chapter Alice searches for Claire and her group of survivors of the zombie apocalypse, which were headed for Alaska looking for the infection free zone Arcadia. Wentworth Miller joins the series and gives a strong performance. Additionally, the over-the-top action scenes are quite impressive, and bring a lot of energy to the film. However, things start to fall apart in the last act as the story goes off in some bizarre directions. Yet for a cheesy horror film, Resident Evil: Afterlife is pretty entertaining.",
    "For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the characters in the movie. Sorry for those who's lives were so well protected that they've never been exposed to the likes of us but, that's how we talk and act. It's a type-A environment and we use it to protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.<br/><br/>I am well versed on the facts as provided by the MSM however, as someone in the biz I also know that the fly in the ointment are the facts.<br/><br/>1. The firing of mortars is an art and the mortar launcher has to be anchored to the ground or every mortar will land off target. The mortars landing on the CIA compound are dead accurate and also require spotters to assist with any corrections.<br/><br/>2. Aviano AB, Italy is about 2-hours away. Had they been launched, even if only to do a low fly-by, would have driven off the attackers; just like I used them in Iraq in Mosul, Tikrit, and Baghdad. I don't know why the Commander of the 555 (Triple Nickel) didn't launch. It's one of the big questions that remain unanswered by the media or the movie.<br/><br/>3. Hillary's statement that, \"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?\" was a red herring. Because it was neither. As later testimony bore out, it was a planned, coordinated, terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11.<br/><br/>4. All UAS aircraft are armed. As stated in the movie could have assisted in the defense of the embassy or the CIA compound.<br/><br/>5. General Ham, AfricaCom CC is someone I worked with in Mosul in 2004 for 6-months.

    "I went to a small advance screening of this movie on July 19th, knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy/adventure quest of some sort.<br/><br/>The plot line really is nothing like I have seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters. In spite of what first impressions may give, it isn't cheesy, corny, tacky, or ridiculous, and is actually highly entertaining and funny. The flow is quite well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged out. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds much to the film, as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or TV. And even though I might have known what was coming at points, I still couldn't bear to stop watching the screen; to my knowledge, not a single person left the theater during the entire movie.<br/><br/>My one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film, and as brilliant as it is I can't figure out why.",
    "The early 90s version of an action movie - non stop gunfire and fights. One very good reason to watch this series is that any movie after this seems to be excellent. The only saving grace are some really old wisecracks from Jason Statham. Skip it, if you need to.",
    "It's hard to say if is an improvement or not on the original, but it's certainly a good continuation of the story this time more focused on Alex's origin and life. The animation looks great, the humor is on point of course, and the characters with so much more development. With some great moments is a fun sequel to all ages!",
    "Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from \"Scarface\". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled \"American Dream\".<br/><br/>Anybody complaining about the \"cheesiness\" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana.<br/><br/>This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.<br/><br/>The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa.<br/><br/>Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. \"Scarface\" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10",
    "I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.",
    "Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created.",
    "WHY? It did not have to be romantic. The first end was more beautiful. Why did not it end? If it was so, I gave it 9 points. Apart from that, it was a pleasant film that was exciting. The show was clearly the best film. Entering new characters was also nice.<br/><br/>Serie Total Review: My favorite character was Rosalie. Most do not even know the character. Bella was a really absurd character. The writer did not really do this job. It is in Jacob.\nEdward character was a simple, stereotypical lover character. There was no feature. It was unsuccessful.\nGenerally the characters sucked. I did not know any characters.",
    "Halfway through this movie I considered it an 8 out of 10 and decently spent money. The second half came as a big surprise. George Clooney let go of all his suave and let his eyes show fear and isolation that real people feel.<br/><br/>There were two things going on in this movie. On one end, we were looking at the people getting fired. On the other end, we were seeing the problems with Ryan's way of life. The interviews at the end with the people who lost their jobs explaining that it was family and support that brought them through bad times hit a perfect note for bringing both parts of the story together.<br/><br/>The title of this film literally explains what it is like to not know what aspects of your life are solid, such as a home or a significant other. Everything going on is simply up in the air. One day, what you thought was one way will turn out to be something else entirely.<br/><br/>Best of Reitman's three. Very much recommend it.",
    "Blade (1998) is the best action/horror vampire slaying movie ever made! I always have enjoyed watching Blade. My number one favorite Blade film I love this film to death. It is one of the best action sci-fi films of all time. Wesley Snipes best role till it's days ever! No one can play Blade like Wesley Snipes did! Blade is not an origin story, but it is a real world of darkness. Blade is just so bad and anti-hero which is perfect for the world he drives in. It is my favorite comic book Vampire movie. I love this film, I love the action and I love everything in it! I love Wesley Snipes and Kris Kris Kristofferson so much they have such a chemistry between each other. Wesley Snipes Kicks ass!!!!! This is the most super hero Vampire slayer film ever made! <br/><br/> It is been so long since I last watch this film. I kept watching it 11.year ago in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was been released I kept watching Blade 1 and 2 on my CD on my computer and on VHS tape that I had this film. Blade of trilogy was the only film I owned on VHS I did not owned Blade II or Blade: Trinity at that time, but I have now the whole trilogy on Blu-ray. The best dang vampire slaying movie ever (say that fast five times)! Its funny too, it shows him killing a bunch of vampires but then regular people are thinking that he is killing humans! I watch this film as a child and all the blood in it and the violence made me crunch. I grew up with this film, 11.years ago kept constantly watching this film over and over, till it's days it is my favorite best Vampire flick. Blood and the crunch in this movie is AWESOME!! Just awesome! <br/><br/>So In this movie Blade is a half human, half vampire, hybrid he protects the human race from other vampires and in this movie he has to stop Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff). Deacon Frost wants to resurrect the blood god \"La Magra\", And he needs Blade's blood and he needs 12 volunteers. So that he can walk in the sunlight and declares extinction to human race. Blade is humanity's last hope!Wesley Snipes plays a half-mortal, half-immortal charged with ridding the earth of a race of vampires led by Stephen Dorff in this action-packed blockbuster.<br/><br/>This movie right here oh my god! is this movie AWESOME! Watching this as kid you really don't know much, other that Wesley Snipes is a Bad Ass!!!! But now when you are older you can really know how much of a bad ass Blade really was and he does making a point! Wesley Snipes is AWESOME! Yes awesome!<br/><br/>So yea... Wesley Snipes does a good job in this movie, everyone does a great job in this movie, so far, even Donal Logue as Quinn with a long hair and beard hi did a wonderful job. Stephen Dorff is actually pretty good, I haven't really seen much of Stephen Dorff's work yet, I'm pretty sure he is not even around today, I am not sure what happened today, I'm not sure if he just drop off the map or if he just quit acting all together, but yea. You would never guess this was MARVEL movie because MARVEL's name was nowhere near this property so far. So that was kind a odd to see this choice but yea, we all knew who he is anyways, so that become kind a cool, and yea violence, blood, the gore amazingly AWESOME!!!!! Yea, I brought the word amazingly back. It is crazy, over the top, sword fights, knives throwing's, all this wrapped in the one and you get that final fight between him and Deacon, dang that is good time! That is good awesome times you know. And it is just nothing like that right now and I am hoping that we get another sequel to Blade: Trinity. The actress Arly Jover who played Mercury, Deacon Frost's girlfriend was so sexy and hot and she is so awesome with her hair and changing her hair styles for 11.years I was confused with a thought that Deacon's girlfriend was played by Traci Lords because she is blonde. It took me so long to figure it that out, that it was Arly Jover played Deacon's girlfriend and not Tracy Lords. <br/><br/>What I like about the character Blade are his gadjets, the sharp ones in particular and his outfit and style! Bottom of line It is my favorite best film still I think Blade II is a little better than Blade, but I still love the trilogy. Movies like this don't exist today. The rating I give to Blade is 10/10",
    "We simply don't deserve László Nemes, the first-time writer/director of Hungary's submission for the Oscar's Foreign Language category, \"Son of Saul.\" Nemes vacuums everything we think we know about filmmaking and the Holocaust, and gives it a raw, intense, and fresh outlook that we haven't seen since Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist,\" perhaps even Steven Spielberg's \"Schindler's List.\" Not to mention, he is thoroughly aided and indebted to the stunning and remarkable talent of Géza Röhrig, in his feature debut. The two simply dance circles around other films and performances seen in this year, with an authentic and genuine approach to art, that we just don't get to experience too often. I'm in awe.<br/><br/>\"Son of Saul\" tells the story of Saul Ausländer, a Hungarian member of the Sonderkommando, the group of Jewish prisoners isolated from the camp and forced to assist the Nazis in the machinery of large- scale extermination. In October 1944, Saul discovers the corpse of a boy he takes for his son. As the Sonderkomando plans a rebellion, Saul decides to carry out an impossible task.<br/><br/>Its direction like Nemes that should make the world very optimistic about the future of cinema. If we have filmmakers like him, getting in the trenches of history and the human spirit, and beckoning its awakening into our souls, we should be so lucky to have him display the beauty and evil of the world in such a provocative and engaging manner. His choices in which to shoot the film, and portray one of the most heinous acts in the history of our existence is just downright scintillating. \"Son of Saul\" plays as if we're watching a disturbing, noxious, and depraved home movie about a time in which we never want to see. From a near first-person perspective, we enter the revolting world of Auschwitz-Birkenau. He uses out of focus camera work, to not bath in the bloodshed, but wallow in the psyche of a man, that is desperate for purpose. It's the single best direction of the year. I'd go so far to say this could be the single best direction seen this decade. His script, along with co- writer Clara Royer, is so painstakingly simple but echoes decades of oppression in its short, respectful run time.<br/><br/>Don't call him a \"poet by profession\" because newcomer Géza Röhrig doesn't believe in the word profession. There's only artists. Géza Röhrig is an artist, of which I haven't seen in some time. With little words, he says countless and devastating things about what he's feeling and what we know about ourselves. He doesn't use cheap tricks to engage the audiences like \"really intense face\" or \"really scared moving.\" Röhrig displays the numb, almost disengaged weight of the world in every physical and vocal movement he chooses to exhibit. It's a flawless, masterful performance that we need more of in this cinematic world.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Mátyás Erdély is your next great craftsman to watch, even though making his mark on films like \"The Quiet Ones\" and \"Miss Bala.\" He frames close-ups that Danny Cohen himself, would hope to achieve in his next collaboration with Tom Hooper. He stays with a person, a scene, a moment, so intelligently, and so vibrantly, he places each one of us in the rooms, full of fear, and full of hopelessness. The subtle yet effective music by László Melis is sonorous but the Sound team is what really needs their praise. Tamás Dévényi (Production Soundmixer), Tamás Székely (Sound Editor), and Tamás Zányi (Sound Designer) create monstrous and dynamic effects that essentially become its own focal point of the story. We are listening intently, desperately, and just fearful at every nick, boom, and cry we come in contact with. It's something everyone should and will notice and applaud.<br/><br/>\"Son of Saul\" sneaks up on you. It's too important and critical to our cinematic landscape to overlooked or forgotten. I can't imagine a more dour and sullen experience this year that fills my heart with this much adoration. It stands toe-to-toe with most Holocaust films created in and before my lifetime. It may be the definitive one this millennium.",
    "I'm not a professional in film reviews, to begin with. I'm just an University student who's got an enormous passion for cinema. It was years since a movie moved my soul in such a profound way. I was stunned when I saw that the movie summed up a 7.5 rating here on IMDb. I thought about this fact for some days, then I kind of make up my answer. \"Youth\" is the symbol of many struggles in cinema and in people's mind. American movies and many Europeans ones as well are so easy to like, just because they're easy to follow. They show facts, actions, somehow explained by words and some ideas. Ideas are like the salt we put on on our meals to make them tasty. Films like \"Youth\" are the exact opposite: words and ideas are the \"meal\", and a few actions are the \"salt\". Actually all the actions are at the end of the movie, they could be perceived as a climax, but they're more like the conclusion of complex exchanges of ideas throughout the movie. I won't comment about technical features, because I don't have the expertise to do it. I just say that the soundtrack is somewhere near perfection, editing as well and there some beautifully shot scenes. As I said, my concern is not about that. \"Youth\" make the viewer think about life, old age, ethics, it accompanies us through some beautiful ideas, and this is where all pros and cons stay. This movie doesn't look for easy ways to impress the viewer, to make him/her somehow forcefully interested to what the screen shows, it requests an open mind and what I ironically call \"the 51st shade\": a fetish to thoughts, not only to material things. Some people don't like Sorrentino because they consider him a \"radical chic intellectual\". It is a righteous choice to be against \"intellectualism\" whatsoever, but it is as well righteous to be against ignorance.",
    "I just watched this movie last night for the first time. I wish I hadn't. It was one of the saddest films I have ever seen. It bothered me to no end. I kept waking up all night thinking about it. I feel terrible.<br/><br/>The movie hit me especially hard because of my personal experiences. I spent several years living in the West and had a relationship with another man, who has since died. Watching this movie brought back many of the emotions I thought were long buried.<br/><br/>I feel like grabbing my coworkers and talking them to death about this film, but I know they don't want to hear about it. I feel this driving need to keep talking about it - maybe if I keep talking about it I can get the ending to change.<br/><br/>If I had known how this film was going to affect me - I wouldn't have watched it. It's too late now - I can't get it out of my head. I don't think I've ever been affected this much by a movie.",
    "I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.<br/><br/>'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx (all good actresses) could respectively bring out the sweetness, vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy, humour, liveliness, enthusiasm and devotion (towards family) of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.<br/><br/>In addition, the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laugh-out-loud Bonnie Hunt, a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston, a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki (one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves)'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating oh-look-I'm-so-cute child models.<br/><br/>The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio, switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side, the wild and smooth cinematography, slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.<br/><br/>The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well, actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story.",
    "People do have their own opinions but there is one thing I came across with, why do some people don't like this movie? I've seen when it came out in 2006 and loved it and I think its better then its sequel, in my opinion. Is because of the world of talking cars? Disney has created many films were animals talk, look at the Mickey Mouse cartoons, there is no people in there world, minus the ones during the early years of Disney. <br/><br/>The story can be clichéd, a big city race car driver goes to a small town, caused a ruck, hates the small town, get to know them and realises he was a jerk and so on and so forth. To me I like this movie. It has some nice atmosphere with the small town and the American dessert of the well- known route 66 with the animation and I do like the world of cars. The story is good too and even though its not in the bar of such great films like the Toy Story series and Monsters Inc. from Pixar, it's good recommendable movie for your kids.",
    "People have complained that this is a horror movie filled with horror movie clichés. But how could it not be? I mean is it suppose to be a horror movie at the local shopping mall? No, of course it is in a haunted house, were else would it be? As much as this movie drew on the horror standards, I found it refreshingly different from most horror movies. Part of what I want from a movie is something different, not more of the same, and I think in that respect, all things considered, this movie delivered.<br/><br/>While it did make use of the standards like jump scares, I really felt the suspense of this movie. I mean, at least for me, this movie was wound very tight. The suspense was ratcheted to the limit.<br/><br/>While I'm still not past Daniel Radcliffe's voice, I still hear Harry or Daniel, his face and body language were spot on, and greatly added to the tension of the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, it is what it is, a suspenseful horror movie that gets the job done. This isn't a genre noted for 'Academy Award' performances. But as suspenseful horror movies go, I was very satisfied with this one, and thought they did have a new approach to an old genre.<br/><br/>Steve B",
    "Heartbreaking yet captivating, Changeling's story was fascinating all the way through, even if the first half was a little slow.

    "There are certain films that get under your skin, never to come out. They change your life, subtly altering your perceptions of reality, almost always for the better.<br/><br/>Dead Poets Society is one of those few films.<br/><br/>I saw the movie back when I was in High School. I had a teacher who told us that we really needed to watch it; in fact, it was our \"homework\" for the day. We didn't need to bring back a report, or talk about it in class. All he asked from us was to watch it, make up our own mind about it, and that was it. As you can imagine, many friends of mine didn't watch it at all; I did. And yes, I feel I changed a bit from there on.<br/><br/>Back when you are young, you never really stop to think what in the world you are doing with your life. You simply live for the day, hope your grades will be enough to pass, and that's it. Long term thinking involves maybe flirting with a girl. Nothing more. What this film showed me was that we have the responsability and the joy of being alive in this planet. That we are dust, and we will go back to it, so we have precious little time to make a difference. That we have a moral obligation to \"seize the day, and make our lives extraordinary\" (my favorite quote in all movie history). That the world, basically is ours. That the only limitations are within ourselves, and that we owe it to us to fight, to rebel against conformity, to change what we hate and keep what we love. That living in this world is a beautiful responsability, and that only cowards dare not to change it for the better.<br/><br/>The fact that the cast was basically my age, and was passing through the same dilemmas and situations I was facing made it all so much more powerful.<br/><br/>So here I sit, 12 years from that day. I still don't think I have seized the day completely. But I keep on trying; I always will. I wonder how many people were transformed by this gem of a movie; I hope many.<br/><br/>10 out of 10.

    "My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.<br/><br/>\nFor someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan's remarkable works:\n<ul><li>Memento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I've ever seen. But overall, it doesn't reach the same level of Inception.</li><li>The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven't been able to find the very particular \"Nolan's spirit\" in it.</li><li>The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.</li><li>Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan's nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience's mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.</li><li>Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/>\nSPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven't watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!<br/><br/>It is set in the world where there's technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - \"extractors\" who use this technology to infiltrate the target's subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of steeling, he wants them to plant an idea in a person's subconscious, which is also called \"inception\". In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels \"dream within a dream\", and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito's biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who's dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father's business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer's mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb's past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.<br/><br/>The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb's case, it's the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We're now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn't even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn't care any more, what's important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life.<br/><br/>\nSome short lines about the cast:\n<ul><li>Leo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood Diamond.</li><li>Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have been more intense, given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).</li><li>There was something missing in Ken Watanabe's performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. Maybe it was his English...</li><li>Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn't have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.</li><li>Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.</li><li>Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.</li><li>Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie.</li></ul>",
    "The best movie I ever saw and I watched hundreds off them from Godfather, Pulp fiction, The green mile, The pianist, Schindler's list, Rear window, The shining, Alien etc. What can you ask more: space exploration, apocalyptic earth, emotions, tears, time manipulation, amazing visuals, maybe the best music score, touching acting, everything you want. SHAME on all the oscar \"experts\"!",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "This film isn't for all people. That's to say about a lot of movies in general of course, but this one in particular brings up a big clashing point between critics; What do we want to see in our movies? What is more important, to portray a fictional setting for the sake of giving people a mind blowing visual experience or to amuse and amaze them with clever plot twists and intelligent dialogs?<br/><br/>First lets analyze what exactly this film is made of. Basically, the whole thing is just one epic fighting scene after another. Most noticeably is the camera work and the visual effects. Every shot seems like it was intended to be a work of art. The colors, the characters, the costumes, the backgrounds... every little detail has been given so much attention. During the big fights you'll also instantly notice the unique editing. There are a lot of \"time slowdowns\" throughout the battles which show what exactly is happening. Fatal wounds that slowly leak blood spatters in the air, decapitated heads traveling in slow-motion across the screen... it's all there. <br/><br/>The story on the other hand isn't very complicated, in the sense that the whole movie could probably be described in a sentence or two. The dialogs are simple and most often talk about moral values like freedom and honor. If you would look at the script, it would probably look like another movie that has nothing more to offer then idealistic visions of how life should be.<br/><br/>Reviewers of this title seem to be split up in two groups. They either love it with passion calling it an epic movie of the 21th century, or hate it even more and throw it off like a piece of garbage consisting of mindless action and silly cliché phrases. I feel reluctant to take a position in this argument. Normally it's tolerable to weigh out both sides of this matter to result in a fair judgment about a movie. Not in this one. On the one hand the visual are surely among the best to be witnessed in a movie. Every detail, every background, every special effect set to the scenes are so mindblowingly stunning. On the other hand the plot and dialogs are of the most simplistic and quite frankly dumb kind. \"I fight for freedom! I'd rather die in honor then live in shame!\" Sounds familiar? <br/><br/>Of course it could be debated that this movie was never intended in the first place to have a unique plot that makes your head spin. But from an objective point of view it's still lacking in this department, so it should be noted.<br/><br/>Now that's fine and all, but does that all make of the film? Is it worth watching or what? I think it is. For me the good outweighs the bad by miles. From the second the movie started it grabbed me and didn't let go. Every battle, every scene of the movie had me at the tip of my chair. Everything from the strong acting to the wondrous visuals to the war-shouts of the soldiers was just so stunning... it was truly a wonderful experience.<br/><br/>I did not one single moment felt like the movie lacked anything. But I could imagine why other people did.<br/><br/>So here's the deal.<br/><br/>If you are easily impressed by beautiful landscapes, wonderful camera-work and editing and powerful acting then go see this. Right. Now. You'll be missing out if you don't. There is so much to see, so much power in the way this comic is translated to the big screen... It'll leave you in awe.<br/><br/>However, you are looking for a good story, clever plot twists, some innovating to the world of the movies then skip this. 300 contains nothing of this, nor does it wants to give you this. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie so much, but I know there will be people that will pass of as rubbish, and that's understandable. Just be sure to make up your mind about what you want to see when you go to the theater yourself instead of being drawn into bias by the tons of reviews this site has to offer.",
    "Talk about an appropriate title. <br/><br/>This is a collection of 11 short stories directed by indie stalwart Jim Jarmusch (\"Strangers in Paradise\", \"Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai\") that have been filmed over the last 18 years, all of which involve two or more characters simply sitting at a table, conversing over...yep, coffee and cigarettes. <br/><br/>In the hands of a lesser director that might be extremely boring, but Jarmusch is a master of subtle understatement and great deadpan humor. This may be one of the funniest movies you've ever seen in which no one cracks a smile. <br/><br/>Almost all the actors play themselves, which adds a meta-theatrical, slightly surreal touch to it all. <br/><br/>Among my favorite stories are one in which an overly eager Alfred Molina has a surprise in store for coolly arrogant fellow actor Steve Coogan and a great one in which Cate Blanchett plays both herself and her jealous cousin Shelby. Then there's the one where Tom Waits and Iggy Pop meet in a dive bar to discuss things and have a smoke (to celebrate quitting smoking), Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes experimenting with a Tesla coil, and in the funniest casting, RZA and GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan sharing some downtime with, of all people, Bill Murray. I also like the one with Spike Lee's twin siblings, Joie and Cinque, dealing with an invasive waiter (a hilarious Steve Buscemi). Almost all the stories are excellent, but there are three that are very forgettable and pretty unnecessary, and they're all in a row, which disrupts the flow of the film. If those three had been taken out, \"Coffee and Cigarettes\" would be just about perfect, but it's still really good. And those three are out of the way in the first half, anyway.<br/><br/>\nFor the first hour the movie feels mainly just like fun. Straight-faced, deadpan, B&W comedy just like \"Strangers In Paradise\". But as it goes on, and strange connections are made between the stories, it seems to have a sudden dreamlike depth to it. <br/><br/>The final story in particular, in which two old men in a dark room (Bill Rice and Taylor Mead) discuss life while on a coffee break that feels like it'll last forever, has a distinct \"Waiting For Godot\" feel and ends the movie on a perfect note of haunting, existential sadness.<br/><br/>\nIt was at that point that I realized I hadn't just watched a string of jokey short stories, but a string of jokey short stories that say a lot about human nature and life in general. <br/><br/>And if that's not enough to interest you, how often do you get to see Tom Waits and Iggy Pop have a conversation? Or RZA, GZA, and Bill Murray?",
    "I did not want to watch this movie but took my wife to see it, because we both saw the one with Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, growing up. The crowd was a lot older than we were(we are almost 50) it was the biggest screen they had at our theater and seats a lot but it was maybe half full on Sunday afternoon. Not one dry eye in the place, it had a great tempo and didn't drag on or have any lulls in the story. We were both very pleased and are still engaging in conversations about the movie. It's my opinion to highly recommend to everyone go out and watch a great movie and a heartfelt movie that redefines love in this time and age we live in. That is my two cents, hope you enjoy as much as we have.",
    "The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has technical merits. However, these merits are impossible to enjoy in a film drowned from beginning to end in the sickening narcissism of both its purported hero and supposedly tragic villains.<br/><br/>I give you The Amazing Spider-Man: a hero with no principles and no goals. He sometimes cares about a girl and sometimes wants to know what happened to his parents, but day-to-day he really only cares about doing what he wants to do--which happens to be helping people, it seems, because it gives them \"hope.\" And what luck! He gives them this just by being himself. Not by being a better person. Not by sacrificing anything else in his life for the greater good. Just by being strong and smart and doing exactly what he feels like doing because that's how he feels. And look: by being himself, other people want to be like him. What a wonderful message for a self-obsessed age. And watching the box office dollars roll in, it would seem that this is just what everyone wants to hear.<br/><br/>Ah, but lovable doe-eyed Petey gives up Gwen for the greater good, right? No he doesn't. He gives her up because he can't face the guilt of having contributed to her father's death--his guilt, and his unquestioned inability to give up being a famous public figure, lead to his need to break up (And his principled stand on this issue is so strong that he will renege on it whenever he feels randy). We never see Peter torn between helping people and helping himself. We see him torn between two paths to self-gratification: the adulation of public heroism (and public vilification, which is a kind of adulation) and the love of a single woman. What about Aunt May? No, not her--she's just in the way of Spidey laundry.<br/><br/>This is the major problem with the reboot: The overshadowing death isn't Uncle Ben's. It's Captain Stacy's. And Captain Stacy didn't die because Peter was self-absorbed. Captain Stacy died because Peter existed. So the standard for Peter being a good person or bad person has nothing to do with his character--it has only to do with his presence. During an over-the-top car chase in the first act, rather than stop a massive truck from smashing through a set of cars (which Sam Raimi has shown us he could have done, assuming equivalence between a truck and a train), Spidey ducks out of the way only to come back after the carnage. This is a hero who says, \"I'm here for you--until it's inconvenient for me, then you're on your own.\"<br/><br/>The long and short of it is that this Spider-Man is in no way heroic. Superheroes are heroic because, while they could decide that they are unconcerned with our struggles, they still feel a moral obligation to help the average Joe. This Spider-Man seems to feel obliged to help only because, as someone superior to everyone else, the world's problems must naturally fall on his shoulders. Not because someone died due to his inaction--because he's exceptional. And helping inferior people is what exceptional people do. Sometimes. When they're not busy dealing with exceptional-person stuff. Like obsessing about parents who unjustly abandoned them while feeling no responsibility whatsoever for the uncle they themselves abandoned.<br/><br/>Add to this a pair of villains who go from being apparently well-meaning if somewhat imbalanced individuals to homicidal maniacs due to a single rejection episode, and you have a two-hour cesspool of poorly justified destructive self-obsession. <br/><br/>Electro could have been a tragic Frankenstein villain. Instead, because a group of random people roots for Spider-Man over him in his first public appearance, he decides everyone should die. Yup--that's his motivation. You don't love me because I'm me? Well, I'll kill you all. Thank you, Columbine.<br/><br/>Harry's the same. After a five-minute meeting in which Spider-Man refuses give him his blood--which he truly believes, based on a single night's research on a single computer file, is the only thing that can save him from a horrible death that won't happen for another 40 years--Harry decides that Spider-Man needs to die right now. And everyone who dies in the process of saving his own old-age skin is perfectly okay. This despite Harry having been Peter's best friend only 48 hours before--though not because they have a long history together, but because they talked for a few hours and remembered how they were friends eight years ago. And it's not like either of them developed any other close relationships over their entire time in high school and college. (Let that be the only mention I will make of this film's preposterous set of causes and effects--and its Attack-of-the-Clones-inspired need to intellectually dictate emotional importance rather than meaningfully display it.)<br/><br/>The original Spider-Man had a single moment of narcissism. Count 'em: one. Only once did Peter Parker step up for glory, himself, and his own objectives, and he immediately paid for it with the death of one of the only three people he loved. This new Peter Parker steps up for himself every day as a part of his playground vision of a hero, and not a single screenwriter or billion-dollar audience member seems to care. This Spider-Man says the world should glorify you for being you, and if that doesn't happen, it's the world that needs to change, not you. And that is what truly terrifies me.",
    "I love watching movies that leave you just thinking at the end. This movie really did that. Now I'm not really sure why it has such bad reviews but i really liked it and would definitely recommend watching it. <br/><br/>Its not another end of the world movie where your main characters saves their family and end up surviving at the end, which is something i liked because it shows how Nick cages's character has to cope with knowing that him and his family will die and theirs no stopping it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ending and how everything comes together at the end to show that this is Gods doing. You would never expect that from the way its played out, other than the foreshadowing from his son talking about not believing god at the beginning",
    "A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands' competition.<br/><br/>Unbelievable? Yes. What's more unbelievable is that somehow the whole thing works  Jack Black's over-the-top enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, the edge-of-disaster suspense is continued throughout the length of the movie, and by the end the audience is so desperate to see how the kids (who they all play their own instruments by the way) perform in the concert that seat wetting would probably go unnoticed. Joan Cusack, as the gobsmacked headmistress, delivers a performance that is worth the price of your cinema ticket in itself. Achieving such tears-down-the cheeks laughter and adrenalin-packed excitement for air guitar music is nothing short of miraculous.<br/><br/>School of Rock is a movie that promises entertainment and delivers. Everything is as it says on the packet. For sheer feelgood factor, this movie is unbeatable  and you can even take the kids!",
    "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>I loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy's dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit & charm along with Indy's usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" isn't by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix' laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.<br/><br/>This is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg's output: A young Indiana \"beginning\" his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat \"You lost today kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it.\" and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. <br/><br/>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There's a bit of kissing/banter, and it's implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there's ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn't need another sequel after third release. There's nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy's Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it's up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",
    "Tony Scott can make good films and bad, personally I think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother, but this is quite possibly his best film.<br/><br/>What makes this film so great is that Scott gives Denzel (on scorching form, better than Training Day) and the revelation who is Dakota Fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness. The set up is absolutely NOT boring, although it takes time - it is involving, and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a superb role for Radha Mitchell as the mother. This all serves to make the action so much more effective, as we are so invested in the characters, for all their all too obvious weaknesses. This film has you on the edge for its entirety, and doesn't cop out at the end either.<br/><br/>The film would of course be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles, when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there (I can only really think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more on-screen power these days). This film should have been huge, given his status and the strength of his performance, and the quality of the film. It just goes to show you that if a studio doesn't back a film to the hilt, it ends up going straight to video. I wish I'd got the chance to see this on the big screen.",
    "I am truly sadden that this film got bashed so much. I hear reviews saying this film \"sucks\" or it has too many inaccuracies. Movies like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List have also \"some\" inaccuracies in them. (They are Masterpieces) It is pretty sad this film has been getting this bashed. It doesn't deserve to be.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is full of suspense and is directed beautifully by Kathryn Bigelow. I'd have to say this is movie truly captures the Iraq War. What a dangerous war it was for our soldiers. This movie shows us what our soldiers went through. This isn't bashing the American soldiers at all or even War. It gives us a great deal of appreciation for our troops who are risking their lives every single day for Us, Freedom and the U.S.A.<br/><br/>The true purpose of this movie is to not just praise the soldiers. But for one of the military's unrecognized heroes which are the technicians of the bombs squads who risk their lives to save others. This is the purpose of the movie to let everyone know what these people do.<br/><br/>This time and I know all of you out there, don't want to hear it, the critics are actually right. This movie is fantastically directed by Kathryn Bigelow and she rightfully deserved her Oscar for best director.<br/><br/>I know many Avatar fans out there probably rated this movie a 1, without even seeing it because it won Best Picture and Avatar didn't. This movie seems its suffering from the curse of Best Picture. More people have watched Avatar than the Hurt Locker. So of course this film has gotten bashed by so many. I think SOME of the bad reviews are the Avatar Fanboys who are just angry Avatar didn't win Best Picture.<br/><br/>Please don't just go along with the bad reviews this film has gotten from IMDb. Just try and watch this film.<br/><br/>The Hurt Locker is a war epic, that I hope it becomes appreciative as time passes. 9/10 Highly recommended.",
    "Fans of Michael Haneke's more morally shocking films such as 'Funny Games', 'Benny's Video' or the draining 'Time of the Wolf' might find themselves surprised by the quieter and slower analysis of evil in his latest work 'Das Weisse Band'. <br/><br/>The action takes place in a North German village shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and in structure presents a number of subtly drawn individual characters as they are caught up in a mysterious series of violent events. <br/><br/>In the hands of a mere moralist this could be an unbearable few hours. But it's credit to Haneke's skill as a film-maker that we are utterly caught up and absorbed by a large cast of children and adults.<br/><br/>One of the on-going arguments in Haneke's films appears to be the origins of human evil, or perhaps more precisely put, individual acts of evil behaviour. Are such acts an individual's responsibility or do they spring from a climate in which particular energies are at work? This is the question Haneke appears to be exploring here (just as was a central question relating to French society in 'Cache').<br/><br/>One of the most disturbing things at the heart of the film is the fact that we do not know why particular acts of evil take place (including the maiming of a disabled child and the beating of a nobleman's son), or even who commits them. However, this is no 'whodunnit', although with its retrospective voice-over from the School Teacher's p.o.v. we are let to believe for a long time that were in a crime/thriller genre.<br/><br/>Throughout his body of work so far, Haneke has suggested that looking for the sort of easy answers films and TV all too readily supply is partly responsible for our misunderstanding how violence in society occurs. (Funny Games). <br/><br/>'The White Ribbon' bypasses the usual dramatical devices of motivation and blame and instead softly focuses on an environment (in this case Germany in the first quarter of the Twentieth Century) in which certain unhealthy energies are at work. <br/><br/>These energies include an emotionally repressed and joyless Protestantism, the mistreatment and oppression of women, the familial abuse of children, the fetishism of strong masculine and patriarchal values, and the un-breachable divide between the rich and the poor. Set over all this, like an umbrella, is the fact that the small provincial society depicted in the film is all but completely isolated from wider society.<br/><br/>Another poster here has pointed out that Haneke is using his village as a microcosm to reflect Germany as a whole, and I would agree with that. Haneke's Dorf, whilst having an individual character, is a relative of Von Trier's Dogville in the sense that it stands for a larger set of national values. In this respect Haneke seems to be diagnosing German society in the run up to the 'Great' War as one of authoritarianism, religious doubt, intolerance, and fear.<br/><br/>What is remarkable in such a film is how little human joy or love is to be found in such a seemingly idyllic rural landscape. The love strand (between the narrator Teacher and the dismissed 17 yr old children's nurse) has a rather strained aspect. It is as though the film maker is suggesting that affection might also be down to available opportunity. <br/><br/>One of the most moving scenes in The White Ribbon is when a young child brings his father, a Priest, a caged bird he has nursed back to health. The father's beloved pet canary was killed (by his daughter as a protest against the bleak, loveless household she's been reared in - a home in which a father shows more affection to a small bird than his own children. <br/><br/>Thus the scene symbolically depicts a child demonstrating the love that the parent himself is unable of showing. Tears fill the priest's eyes. It is a tiny moment of love and hope in an otherwise emotionally barren wasteland. It is also a symbol of how a new generations of Germans have dealt with, and healed, previous decades of pain.",
    "Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.<br/><br/>Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.<br/><br/>The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.<br/><br/>Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.<br/><br/>Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!",
    "Men in Black 3 is fun, if flawed. Hugely better than 2, this stands as the better (if unnecessary) sequel to the original.",
    "I have been waiting for the right time to review this film. I did not feel until today that I was truly ready to say all I had to say about director Rob Reiner's unforgettable staple of 1980s pop culture. When I first saw The Princess Bride, I was only 7 years old, and hardly cognizant of film as anything but a pastime. While I remember the movie as being enjoyable, I did not have anywhere near as strong a liking or appreciation for it as I do now. I certainly did not remember the film as a theater-going experience, and recently, I got the chance to view it, on the big screen, with at least fifty others in attendance at a midnight screening.<br/><br/>Personally, I am one of those people who, by nature, absorbs memorable quotes, and by that token, the entirety of The Princess Bride is fair game. As I sat there watching, I could always hear somebody, if not more than one person, at least whispering along with the movie under his or her breath. Meanwhile, I noticed that there was a wide disparity of age groups. There were pre-teens, teens, people in their twenties, thirties, and some that looked well past forty. If the showing had not been at midnight, I do not doubt that there would have been pre-pre-teens as well.<br/><br/>With a screenplay written by William Goldman (based on his book), The Princess Bride is a classic, familiar story of a princess, her true love, and the forces that come between them. As is evidenced by those in attendance, this is a story for all ages. The manner in which this fairytale part of the story is executed by Goldman and Reiner is memorable enough to make this a great film. As any fan of the movie will tell you, however, it is the film's whimsical, irreverent, pervasive tongue-in-cheek antics that make it an unqualified masterpiece.<br/><br/>If you hang around people who love this film, do not be surprised if they react to unbelievable situations with the exclamation, \"Inconceivable!\" Likewise, if you tell them to just wait a minute, don't be thrown aback when they suddenly sport a Spanish accent in saying, \"I hate waiting.\" And if you suddenly, from out of nowhere, hear, \"Hello.my name is Inigo Montoya.you killed my father.prepare to die,\" don't worry. It's not your fault, and you're not going to die.<br/><br/>While The Princess Bride has the sort of satirical edge more geared towards adults, the film is equally effective as a pure fairytale, and for this reason, there is a little something for everyone. In addition, the film enacts a self-referential tribute to the power and beauty of fairytale stories, even in the current age in which many consider them archaic and obsolete.<br/><br/>A sick grandson (Fred Savage), who is spending his time mindlessly playing video games (of the nostalgic Atari 8-bit type), gets a visit from his grandfather (portrayed through a wonderful performance from Peter Falk). To the grandson's dismay, his elder has brought a book to read to him. When he expresses disapproval at his grandfather's old-fashioned ways, the grandfather's response is, \"When I was your age, television was called books.\" Even this quote stands out as resonant and memorable.<br/><br/>The grandson starts out expressing skepticism and boredom, but of course, as the reading of the story progresses, this gradually gives way to captivation and praise. Buttercup (Robin Wright, in her breakthrough role) is a fair-haired, stunningly gorgeous maiden who has been engaged to the smug, cowardly Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), the prince who rules over the land of Florin. She of course does not love him, and she has been without joy since her true love, a farm boy named Wesley (Cary Elwes), was reportedly murdered on the seas.<br/><br/>Of course, without Wesley, there is no story of true love, and we know that he must miraculously return to her someday. This happens through an extraordinary, and increasingly hilarious, set of circumstances. A group of three bandits kidnap Buttercup with the intent of killing her to precipitate a war between Florin and its enemy, Guilder. These three are (in order of increasing stature) the intellectually pompous Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), the Spanish swordsman Inigo (Mandy Patinkin), and the big-hearted slow-witted giant Fezzik (the late Andre the Giant, in one of the most no-brainer casting decisions in all of film history).<br/><br/>During the kidnapping, however, a mysterious man in black closes in on the trail of the three abductors, and it is this man who takes on each of the three one by one in battles of skill, strength, smarts, and of course, deliciously witty repartee. There is something unusually extraordinary about these battles, however.<br/><br/>With the exception of Vezzini, the abductors are not villains as we might initially perceive them to be. The marvelously choreographed swordplay between the man in black and Inigo, and the hilarious absurdity of the handfight with Fezzik, are not at all about winning or losing. They embody a sense of honor, sportsmanship, and nobility that is rarely exemplified in competition (both fictional and real).<br/><br/>Inigo, Fezzik, and the man in black do not display their skills pretentiously or flauntingly. Instead, they take a strong sense of inner pride in the subtle mastery of their arts. As a result, when we see them engage in competition, there is not a sense of enmity, but a wonderful air of camaraderie.<br/><br/>Also included in the mix are a sadistic count (Christopher Guest) with an odd physical characteristic and a penchant for pain, an albino (Mel Smith) with a stuffy throat, the deadly wrath of an R.O.U.S., and a clergyman (Peter Cook) who makes Elmer Fudd seem eloquently spoken. Most memorable, perhaps, is the appearance of Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as the miracle-man Max and his wife. It has been reported that in the middle of filming this scene, Reiner was forced to leave the set, because Crystal's improvisations were causing him to laugh to the point of being sick.<br/><br/>Regarding the film's casting, every single choice, without exception, is absolute perfection. Cary Elwes not only easily looks the part of a daring, ingenious hero, but as an actor, he has an incredible gift for a subtle mixture of drama and comedy, one that easily coincides with the film's sensibilities. Robin Wright easily essays the role of the headstrong princess, endlessly devoted to her love (with a convincing British accent, despite her American origins).<br/><br/>For the scene of swordplay, Elwes and Patinkin had to study fencing for months, which is impressive, but on-screen, I had no trouble believing that they were characters who had studied for at least several years. Despite his limited acting ability, wrestler Andre the Giant is perfect for the role of Fezzik, and something would be lost with any other actor in his place. And of course, Wallace Shawn is endlessly amusing to watch as the diminutive, perpetually exasperated Vezzini.<br/><br/>We also don't have to hear Christopher Guest and Chris Sarandon speak any lines to know they are portraying villains. The arrogance, callousness, and sliminess are readily apparent in their facial and bodily expressions.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, we have witnessed a wide variety of hilarity, captivating acts of love and heroism, and of course, one of the most satisfying acts of retribution ever put on film (one that immortalizes the film's most famous quote and chooses just the right time and placement for the film's sole swear word).<br/><br/>For someone who watches this film for the first time, and quickly catches on to the film's capricious mix of reverence and satire, the film is a marvel to watch simply for the knowledge that you do not know what will come next. Will there be a touching moment? A reflective one? An act of bravado? Or will our expectations be subverted in an act of comical subterfuge? The answer: any of them will do, as the film has a delectable variety of all of them.<br/><br/>From start to finish, The Princess Bride is a transcendent, magical experience that constantly elicits uproarious laughter and simultaneously immerses the audience in a rich, magnificent, and almost nostalgic world of folklore that, after the end credits roll, seems timeless and undying. In the years since its release in 1987, it has grown into a cult film of legendary status, and judging by the wide variety of ages I witnessed at the screening (as well as the endless barrage of quoting), it seems perfectly reasonable to assume that the film will endure for many years to come.",
    "Honestly, I don't care about dates. I don't care about names, or stats, or if the writers got a bunch of stats confused. I mean did you actually watch the movie, or were you just looking at the screen for misprints on jerseys? To believe that some people can actually watch a movie and then complain that the time line is off with reality is beyond my comprehension. Who cares about the time line! It's not reality that you're watching, it's a movie. Movies, no matter how real the stories they are based on, are not real. They are altered. They are changed to make a better storyline.<br/><br/>If people can be dense enough to complain about names and numbers and dates, then they missed the big picture. They missed a great movie that actually conveys a real message. It's not about the sports, it's about the students. And it's not always about what you put in, it's about what you take out. It's about what you take away from the situation that you've walked into.<br/><br/>That's what this movie is about, not about basketball. It's about life, and how easily people give in and give up. It's about learning, and having faith that people will do the right thing. Yes, it's about public education, and a community on the edge of stupid, but there's more to it than that. You just have to stop looking, and watch.<br/><br/>This movie truly was excellent, right up there on the shelf next to \"With Honors.\" But make sure you are really paying attention, otherwise, what's the point?",
    "I can believe this movie will be a serious disappointment for a person, who is used to and likes to watch Hollywood war movies. Four reasons: 1. It's made in a world, where movie makers tries to have some personality. If you think 'When We Were Soldiers'... well, there are hundreds of directors who you can imagine making a similar war movie with personality and values of a hamburger.<br/><br/>2. Screenplay has a different structure. There's no shocking opening scene like in 'Saving Private Ryan'. This movie starts slowly in a very nice place and ends slowly in a very bad place, without hope or feeling that the characters have achieved something by their heroic actions.<br/><br/>3. It is first a movie about lost causes in the world of war, and only secondly a war movie which takes place in Stalingrad.<br/><br/>4. War scenes portray the horror, insecurity and confusion of a battle, instead of how cool, heroic and exciting fighting looks like. In this sense, this movie is closer to reality than most of the war movies you will ever see. 'Thin Red Line' also had similar \"I would probably crap in my pants in that situation\"-feeling.<br/><br/>Stalingrad, whether you think it as a movie or a war movie has so many good things in it... like honesty. Even the ordinary German soldiers were dreaming about farms in Russia when they were advancing. What a disappointment they must have had in Stalingrad! If you like to watch war movies, meaning also other war movies than When We Were Soldiers or Saving Private Ryan, you should see this one. (9/10)",
    "I was talked into seeing this, and I have to shout it out, because it is a RIOT! I don't write many reviews, but when I love a film, I have to. If I have any complaint on this one, it's the title. I expected gross-out humor (\"crude\"). There isn't any, really. It's actually extremely unpredictable, subtle and extremely smart humor.<br/><br/>It has a story arc that you begin to somewhat anticipate, but you don't feel you're being patronized. Instead, you're left feeling that very intelligent people put this thing together in hopes that everyone would find something to love about it.<br/><br/>The cast is great, the animation is fun, and it's non-dizzying 3-D.<br/><br/>When I saw it, the entire audience clapped at the end, because we were entertained throughout, and found the ending really satisfying.<br/><br/>What else? Sweet emotions crop up because we can all relate to the family dynamics. Every family has the screw-up, the salt of the earth, the rebel, and the stubborn one. And it has one of the funniest babies ever put on film. A baby unlike any baby you'll ever see anywhere.<br/><br/>Very, very funny. Definitely recommend.",
    "This movie is soooo gross! The eye scene? Puke rising up to my mouth just thinking about it! Blech!!! So much excessive horror nastiness! Sick as heck, but just hard not to watch! Throw in the gorgeous women, and you've got a disgustingly beautiful horror flick!<br/><br/>I loved the Oli character - the king of swing - \"Of course my horse\"! And the gang of young boys that want gum! So weird! I also liked the whole Europeaness of the film - the location, language, and overall feel of it! Lent a big piece of realism to it all.<br/><br/>My negative rant is that I wanted to know more about the town, and the people, and the \"why\" of it all. I know money is part/most of it. But I wanted to know why.",
    "With such an epic story, you would think someone like Stone would produce an epic film. From the random accents of the characters (specifically, I have no idea what Jolie was trying to do), to some pretty atrocious acting from Farrell-he's capable of much better, but this was at the height of his grandiosity and ego. There are so many moments where it feels like the film is onto something, only to have it stop and spin off into another, pointless direction. Bottom line: a $155 mil film about Alexander the Great should have been iconic, but Alexander falls flat on its face from the weight of the egos involved.",
    "How do I start? I love this film! It has a great plot line and incredible music. It is a fun musical that makes you want to get up and dance.<br/><br/>Grease is the story of Danny Zucko and Sandy Olsen (or Dumbruski) two high school seniors who fall in love over the summer. They have a wonderful summer together and are sad to see it end. The first day of school arrives and little does Danny know him and Sandy would soon be reunited. But Sandy is shocked to find the nice guy she meet at the beach is the leader of a greaser gang called 'The T'birds' Meanwhile Sandy is trying to fit in with her new \"friends\" the T'birds female counterparts The Pink Ladies. Will Sandy and Danny ever be together again? Along with this plot comes song that will be stuck in your head for centuries. Such songs include Summer Nights, Beauty School Dropout and the now famous song Greased Lightining. Grease is a timeless classic that will have you singing and dancing by the end of the movie.",
    "This film will generate anger because it throws a \"deadpan\" brick directly towards cultural dysfunction and mass delusion. \"War Machine,\" and Brad Pitt, even exceeded the deadpan message of \"Being There\" a film from a less cynical time in history but still relevant to this day. <br/><br/>\"War Machine\" does a great job illustrating how disconnected the every-man has become in relation to reality. We live in a time where facts are now selectively chosen to support forgone perspectives rather than being absolute, universal, and irrefutable. <br/><br/>We live in a time where personage, perceptions, and public relations matter more than overview, objectives, conclusions, and endpoints. Reality has been set adrift. <br/><br/>It was a brave thing to produce this film because it speaks to a very narrow audience. Most people won't be entertained by the communication mechanism (deadpan) nor will the understand the message. Few people will be open to perspectives other than those which are preconceived. Some people are not aware and thus cannot acknowledge the wounds and damage that political lies have done to the American process and psyche. <br/><br/>To conclude our failed state of affairs, the affairs of a failed nation state (our nation state) I am not with him because he is certainly not with me no matter how much he tells me otherwise. The cohesion of leadership, truth, and the American way has left the building.<br/><br/>It is more of a shame that people won't understand this film, or won't want to. And that is how far we have fallen. Perhaps Rome fell the same way on the sword and misadventure of its own lies and delusion.",
    "Kevin Klaven (Paul Rudd) hasn't a friend in the world - or so he realizes when he becomes engaged to Zooey (Rashida Jones) and finds he can't come up with a single male buddy to be in his wedding party. The solution? Go out and make some platonic guy friends, even if it means having to rely on your mommy (Jane Curtin) and your gay younger brother (Andy Samberg) to help you do it. Eventually, after a number of faltering attempts, Kevin alights on Sydney (Jason Segel), a mucho macho bundle of testosterone who, like a latter-day Henry Higgins to Kevin's Eliza Doolittle, instructs the awkward lad on the fine art of \"being a man.\" But as with any good teacher/pupil relationship, each side winds up learning a little something from the other before it's all over.<br/><br/>A straight man far more comfortable in the company of women than of men, Kevin emerges as the ultimate metrosexual figure: fastidious in demeanor, sensitive to the needs of others, and courteous to a fault (he even admits to liking \"The Devil Wears Prada\" in a moment of unguarded weakness). He doesn't really know how to roughhouse it with the boys, and any efforts he makes in that direction inevitably lead to failure. Until our man Sydney steps into the breach to give him a few badly needed pointers, that is.<br/><br/>Smoothly directed by John Hamburg, \"I Love You, Man\" is a relaxed, breezy and sharply written male-bonding comedy that - miracle of miracles - doesn't play down to its audience (it may be crude at times, but it's rarely childish). The Hamburg/Larry Levin screenplay does a clever job poking fun at the double entendres inherent in any modern-day bromance, though one wishes certain characters - Kevin's family members, in particular - had been allotted a little more in the way of screen time. That being said, the performances are all first-rate, with Rudd and Segel playing to their respective strengths - Rudd's of the tongue-tied, self-effacing Mr. Nice Guy who needs lessons in \"manning up,\" and Segel's of the refreshingly blunt but socially indelicate Man/Child who clearly needs to do some growing up.<br/><br/>There's additional excellent work from J.K. Simmons, Jamie Pressly, Sarah Burns and Rob Huebel, among others.<br/><br/>It's also a bit of a casting coup to get both Jane Curtin from the first generation of SNL players and Andy Samberg from the current one together in the same film. Finally, some unlikely cameo appearances by Lou Ferrigno and the band Rush, all appearing as themselves, add to the spirit of fun that permeates the film.",
    "Gravity is a wonderful work of art. Cuaron and Lubezki are at their visual storytelling bests, which is quite a statement. The shots of outer space are long and gorgeous, and the sound design is impeccable, both encompassing the vastness and silence of space as well as letting us see Ryan's perspective. The grounded, careful science of the film and the exceptional effects and camera work give us a sense of what space is like - a tall order. What brings Gravity to the next level is the level of personal connection we reach with Kowalski, and especially Ryan. I felt nervous and scared every time Ryan was faced with a seemingly impossible situation. It is so impressive that Cuaron could get us to connect with Ryan and make every moment so thrilling despite having next to no dialogue and only having two characters in the whole film! The scene where Kowalski returns and enters the shuttle was far and away the scene of the movie for me, especially as it hit me that it was in her mind. The score is effective in heightening tension. Gravity is a groundbreaking work of art that, despite its narrow focus on just Ryan's journey, he manages to both amaze us visually and thrill us, start to finish.",
    "The movie was not unlike other movies where you see the good guy go rogue after rough handling by \"the system\". But I really liked the development of the characters in the beginning, and I am sure I am not the only one out there hoping that the \"Law Abiding Citizen\" would be able to pull it off.<br/><br/>Then came the middle where plot points become strained, where we have to take a few leaps of faith and leave the world of genius for one of Hollywood. OK, I'm still there, taking the ride with you.<br/><br/>But then we get to the ending which destroys the film and makes it into brain pablum; mental oatmeal that anyone can digest but no one can get any flavor from. Mr. Genius buys several industrial areas -- but why? Only 2 seemed to be necessary for the plot. And why would Panama know the purchase prices? And down to the cent! Corporations don't need to share that information with foreign governments. Nix that link and this movie would have been more interesting. We're expected to believe a genius would leave the cleaning cart in obvious view in the hallway and right next to the area where he put the bomb? We're expected to believe the genius wouldn't have trapped his escape route. And we're expected to believe they transferred this bomb from Point A to Point B without setting it off and in record time, all while Foxx waits in the cell, and Scotty Junior brings up the rear, unseen and unheard.<br/><br/>I wanted Foxx's arrogant character to lose his daughter, to feel what this man went through, and then I wanted him to get away with it.<br/><br/>Anyone agree?",
    "Wow - this was unexpected. The trailers had me believe that after 'Battle L.A.' and 'Oblivion' this would be yet another bleak, action- packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about an alien invasion - what the trailers failed to convey almost entirely is that over long stretches, this is also seasoned with nearly as much humor as 'Groundhog Day'. That it would invite comparisons with the Harold Ramis/ Bill Murray classic was obvious, given the time loop premise, but I never expected to what extent those comparisons would actually be justified and that this film would really tap into a similar kind of comedy. Luckily, it is all the better for it.<br/><br/>Most unexpected of all, the main reason the comical aspects during the first half of the film work so well, is Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. This is easily Cruise's meatiest role since his turn in 'Magnolia' as Frank T.J. Mackey; forget his usual stern, poster boy heroes: here he plays an entirely different character – and he really seems to relish the opportunity. I won't give away too much, but be prepared to chuckle and laugh when you see a new side of Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>Yet while this is not nearly as bleak as the trailers suggested, it certainly isn't a comedy either. And it absolutely IS an action-packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about battling an alien invasion (the trailers got that right), albeit one with a funny bone and great characters. Speaking of which, the rest of the cast is also very good, especially the gorgeous Emily Blunt. It seems that no matter what she does, she always comes across as genuine and real; here she succeeds in portraying her character - a tough, seasoned soldier other soldiers refer to as \"full metal bitch\" (no kidding!) - with just the right touch of vulnerability to make her that much more believable. Bill Paxton and Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie, and while they are great (as usual), character-wise, they don't do anything here that you haven't seen them do before. <br/><br/>As for the Sci-Fi spectacle that the trailers promised, I'm glad to report that the film delivers. The battle scenes are beautifully orchestrated (not the Transformer-style blur where you can't make out anything anymore), and there are moments when the intensity of the fighting recalls the landing on Omaha Beach in 'Saving Private Ryan' - without the gore, obviously (after all, this is PG-13). The design of the aliens - the production design in general - is incredibly well done, although I would lie if I said it was something ground-breaking and new the way the first 'Matrix' was (it IS breathtaking, though).<br/><br/>So my verdict: With one of the most inventive (adapted) scripts for an original (mega-budget) film in a long time and the best Tom Cruise we've seen in years, 'Edge of Tomorrow' will have you chuckle and laugh nearly as much as drop your jaw in awe: this is what Hollywood should take as a blueprint for exciting summer entertainment henceforth. 9 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",
    "The future of movies doesn't seem too bright since all we're getting are remakes, adaptations and unnecessary prequels/sequels and that's why original stuff like SOURCE CODE can really make my day.<br/><br/>Honestly, the trailers and initial premise didn't seem promising; some soldier can travel back in time and has to stop an some evil terrorist from bombing America. At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it.<br/><br/>Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. <br/><br/>To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.",
    "Mike Newell is the weirdest choice for director of a Mafia drama, but he actually makes a terrific fist of it, delivering one of the very best gangster movies ever made. Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are all in top form in front of the camera, too.<br/><br/>Depp plays undercover FBI agent Joseph Pistone in this intriguing true story. Pistone is trying to infiltrate his way into a mob family in order to gather evidence against them. He assumes the identity of \"Donnie Brasco\" and slowly but surely earns the love and trust of an old-pro hit-man named Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino). As the months go by, Pistone's marriage begins to fall apart as he is away from his wife (Heche) pretty much all the time. The line between his real life and his undercover life blurs together and he finds himself dangerously close to being seduced by the violent Mob lifestyle.<br/><br/>Donnie Brasco is an extraordinary film in many ways. As already mentioned, the performances are note-perfect. But there's so much more to it than that. The late 70s period details are impeccably captured; the dialogue is extraordinarily raw and realistic; the moral dilemma facing Depp is achingly, agonisingly conveyed. It's such a powerful picture, completely involving, that by the end you find yourself wrapped up in Pistone's predicament, asking yourself what decisions you would make in the same circumstances. Very few movies genuinely inspire you to debate the whats, whys and wherefores of the main character and his actions... but with Donnie Brasco, that's just what you'll find yourself doing.",
    "Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.<br/><br/>Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.<br/><br/>Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.<br/><br/>The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!<br/><br/>This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.<br/><br/>PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive.",
    "This movie is much more than and definitely deeper than one would suspect from the 'syrupy' trailers most people have seen. The understory, gradually revealing the early life of P.L. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins, and depicting how the people in her dysfunctional family led her to write Mary Poppins, is the true core of this movie. I will never see Mary Poppins in quite the same way. All of the acting is superior, and the score is excellent. This is not the shallow, childlike movie that many will expect. I would not recommend it for children 11 and under, depending on the child. Otherwise, I highly recommend this movie, even if you are not a big fan of the original Mary Poppins film.",
    "\"Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri\" marks a milestone for writer/directer Martin McDonagh and is an idea piece on a mother's struggle with her town after posting billboards containing a call to action in regards to her murdered daughter. With outstanding screen writing and near perfect editing, this powerhouse of a film is easily one of the best all year and is driven with force and intensity by its lead, Frances McDormand.<br/><br/>What begins as a narrow and focused drama, gradually escalates to a film with big themes and ideas, relevant social commentary, and much more subplots than anticipated. \"Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri\" is packed with questions and a few answers about anger, revenge, violence, and kindness. The story shows people in a realistic light I've never quite seen before. We're presented with characters and their genuine emotions. Nothing feels sugarcoated of fluffed but it never lacks emotional impact either. <br/><br/>The movie balances its seemingly contradictory tones beautifully by crafting a dark comedy that feels heavy due to strong subject matter, while at the same time, utilizing comedic moments that feel completely natural to the character's motivations. It's obvious great care was taken into this script and the method in which it's constructed. <br/><br/>One of the most talked about elements to this film are the strong performances; particularly by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. Rightfully so, this is some of their best (if not their best) work these eyes have beheld and they steal the show in every film they're in. That's not take away from Woody Harrelson and Lucas Hedges, as well as the entire cast who give memorable performances and paint shockingly believable characters that we feel we know personally. <br/><br/>If there is anything that might turn audiences away from this film, it might be its harsh subject matter despite none of it every being depicted as well as its language and execution with the material. Personally, this has a strong impact and I wouldn't have changed anything about it. It's a highly recommended film with a lot to ponder at the end and is definitely a contender for best movie of the year. Definitely don't miss this one.",
    "Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.<br/><br/>Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.<br/><br/>Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.<br/><br/>I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.<br/><br/>I hope my talk helps.",
    "So i love it! Not the usual.\nThe story is complex and condensed for the sake of the movie and as such hard to understand. I recommend reading the source material first. Imagine how bad an American remake would be if they messed up Ghost In The Shell that much!!",
    "With workers striking in Russia, the crew of the battleship Potemkin feel a certain kinship for the plight of their brothers. When they are served rotting, maggot infested meat some of the crew object, only to find themselves singled out and placed in front of a firing squad. With the marines seconds away from firing the deadly shots, ordinary seaman Grigory Vakulinchuk steps into the breach and intervenes to save the men by appealing to the firing squad to ignore their orders. When the officers take their revenge and kill Vakulinchuk, all are bonded together in the struggle; a bond that reaches to the city of Odessa where the rebellion grows, leading to a bloody and historic series of events.<br/><br/>It is hard to imagine that anybody who has seen quite a few films in the past few decades would be unaware of this film, but it is perhaps understandable that fewer have had the opportunity to actually sit down and watch. I had never seen this film before but had seen countless references to it in other films and therefore considering it an important film to at least see once. The story is based on real events and this only serves to make it more interesting but even without this context it is still an engaging story. The story doesn't have much in the way of characters but it still brings out the brutality and injustice of events and it is in this that it hooked me  surprisingly violent (implied more than modern gore) it demonising the actions and shows innocents falling at all sides in key scenes. The version I saw apparently had the original score (I'm not being snobby  modern rescores could be better for all I know) and I felt it worked very well to match and improve the film's mood; dramatic, gentle or exciting, it all works very well.<br/><br/>The feel of the film was a surprise to me because it stood up very well viewed with my modern eyes. At one or two points the model work was very clearly model work but mostly the film is technically impressive. The masses of extras, use of ships and cities and just the way it captures such well organised chaos are all very impressive and would be even done today. What is more impressive with time though is how the film has a very strong and very clean style to it  it is not as gritty and flat as many silent films of the period that I have seen; instead it is very crisp and feels very, very professional. Of course watching it in 2004 gives me the benefit of hindsight where I can look back over many films that have referenced the images or directors who have mentioned the film in interviews; but even without this 20:20 vision it is still possible to see how well done the film is and to note how memorable much of it is  the steps and the firing squad scenes are two very impressive moments that are very memorable. The only real thing that might bug modern audiences is the acting; it isn't bad but silent acting is very different from acting with sound. Here the actors all over act and rely on their bodies to do much of their delivery  word cards just don't do the emotional job so they have to make extra effort to deliver this.<br/><br/>Overall this is a classic film that has influenced many modern directors. The story is engaging and well worth hearing; the directing is crisp and professional, producing many scenes that linger in the memory; the music works to deliver the emotional edge that modern audiences would normally rely on acting and dialogue to deliver and the whole film is over all too quickly! An essential piece of cinema for those that claim to love the media but also a cracking good film in its own right.",
    "We all know the story and it's outcome. Yet we want to see it for ourselves out of curiosity if the story is somewhat interesting after hearing the headlines. Isn't that true of every true story that is portrayed on film? People have commented that Aron Ralston is a loner and an idiot and give the movie 2 stars or less. How is that a bad comment about the story in the film? The character himself, and therefore the real person, calls himself these very things! As a loner, he felt invincible, yet as a self declared \"idiot\" he has the intelligence to admit how stupid of a thing he had done. Yes, we can all sit on our little chairs and watch the movie and call him an idiot for not telling anyone where he's going or what he's doing... like we've NEVER done something idiotic before. Sure, perhaps our very own moment of lack of good judgment has not put us in a situation that we may have sealed our own doom...for Ralston he had to come to terms with himself that, indeed he may have just killed himself unintentionally.<br/><br/>People also commented that he survives by sheer luck. To them I say, can YOU survive for 6 days doing the same things Ralston did? Forget the idea that you would never be so stupid. The point is, if it were to happen to you, what would YOU have done? Would you even have stopped for a moment to leave a video for your loved ones-loner that you are?<br/><br/>People still commented that Ralston felt no pain. We could dismiss the initial accident as being in shock. Later on he shows a great deal of pain...and ingenuity. When I myself had an oops moment with a stupid chainsaw cutting a hole in my knee, I didn't feel one ounce of pain. I just kept saying to myself, how could I be so stupid to have not been more careful. <br/><br/>If you only hated this movie because it is about one person for most of the film stuck in a canyon, hallucinating about life, screaming out for help ONCE and hating yourself for doing so because you know no one is out there to hear you and you know yelling is futile (by the way people commented that they would be yelling out - for what? save your energy and look for other viable solutions idiot!), contemplating taking your own life because of your incredible mistake you've made, making a final decision - one that would leave you \"crippled\" - and I mean no offense to amputees, still knowing that even without your right arm you still have to carry your bloodied self, weak from dehydration and having lost over 40 pounds in 6 days (I kid you not), to the HOPE of safety...if you hated this movie for reasons such as these...then you've never had a true \"oops\" moment. You are perfect...perfectly lying to yourself.",
    "As most are undoubtedly aware this is the film that the director virtually expunged from his repertoire. But why did Stanley Kubrick really disown SPARTACUS (1960)? The answer can be summed up in two words: absolute control. Kubrick wanted total administrative as well as artistic authority over the making of the film about a revolt of gladiators and slaves in ancient Rome.<br/><br/>But you will notice that Bryna Productions not only financed SPARTACUS but also an earlier film directed by Kubrick, PATHS OF GLORY (1958). Bryna was Kirk Douglas' film company and, as most filmgoers know, he was the star of both films. Besides having all the money to make the films, Douglas had artistic vision as well. Only three weeks into what would prove to be an incredibly complex and arduous production, Douglas fired venerable director Anthony Mann (RAW DEAL, RAILROADED,THE FURIES, THE NAKED SPUR, THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, MAN OF THE WEST, etc.) from SPARTACUS. With only two days notice, Kubrick was hired to replace him.<br/><br/>Shooting PATHS OF GLORY, Douglas had confined his criticisms and objections to Kubrick's failed rewriting of the script (they went with the original screenplay). Douglas' complaints and artistic influence were far greater on SPARTACUS, much to Kubrick's chagrin. Though the director craved autonomy over every aspect of the film, Douglas would not budge. A tense compromise was reached but ultimately Douglas had the last word. Kubrick saw himself as just a hired gun. And he would never allow himself to be placed in this position again.<br/><br/>Later, both men would complain about the film's outcome and each other. They never made another movie together. <br/><br/>But SPARTACUS is no uneven patchwork of divergent ideas. The film is cohesive and arresting. At the restored version of three hours and eighteen minutes, there is practically no dead footage in the film. Dalton Trumbo's screenplay is surprisingly economical, with sharply drawn characters placed against the sweeping historical majesty and violent sociological tumult of ancient Rome. Quite plainly, the gloriously inventive music by Alex North is among the greatest scores ever written for a motion picture. And despite Kubrick's bad experience, he managed to guide the actors towards creating outstanding work (a best supporting actor Oscar for Peter Ustinov). He even transformed the very real enmity between Laughton and Olivier into an on-screen asset. His other contributions were considerable also (the large scale and power of the battle sequence, for example). In the end, for the film at least, the clash of giant egos proved fortuitous. Recommendations: for greater insight and detail on this and Kubrick's other films I urge you to seek out Jan Harlan's excellent documentary, STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES, and Vincent LoBrutto's exhaustive, highly informative biography, STANLEY KUBRICK. For the producer's views on SPARTACUS and its director, take a gander at Kirk Douglas' very candid autobiography, THE RAGMAN'S SON.",
    "I keep reading reviews for Cars 2 and I am kind of surprised. Some people went as far as comparing it to the Star Wars prequels. Sure, Cars 2 definitely is no \"Finding Nemo\" or \"Toy Story.\" But it sure was fun, at least for me. The plot was an obvious reference to James Bond and Mission Impossible. I enjoyed the spy gadgets and political overtones. It was action-packed and not only enjoyable for little kids, but for older kids and adults too. Why all the hate? Heck, even Roger Ebert and Rolling Stone liked it!<br/><br/>In my opinion, Cars 1 was a little slow. It dragged a little too long in certain parts. Cars 2 suffers from no such thing.<br/><br/>To sum it up; Cars 2 may not be Toy Story but it sure is FUN and ENTERTAINING.",
    "Kimberly Corman has a terrifying vision that a highway pile up will claim her life and that of her friends. Blocking the entrance with her car, Kimberly watches in horror as the crash unfolds, thus saving her life and that of the people in the queue behind her. But the grim reaper is not impressed and he's coming to claim the deaths of all those who should have died in the crash.<br/><br/>For a sequel to truly work well it has to come up with something fresh, otherwise why do a sequel eh? Well the makers of Final Destination 2 choose to use the basic same formula of the hugely enjoyable first film, only adding more black humour into the crazy death design broth. Opening with a quite horrific highway pile up, FD 2 then takes us on a journey that sees an assortment of folk offed in various and gruesome ways. The story remains the same as the first film, even though writers Bress and Gruber think they are being intricate by weaving this plot into the original story, but ultimately it's just a devilishly nonsense fun picture. Ali Larter returns for a second helping, and she in turn is joined by a bunch of no mark actors waiting for death, which is perfectly fine for the genre discerning fan.<br/><br/>This is a riot, and as long as you don't look too deep into it (why would you really?) you may just find yourself having a real good time. 7/10",
    "I'm usually pretty cynical about cheesy movies but this movie absolutely floored me.  Drew Barrymore was phenomenal playing role of Julia Sullivan. I've seen the movie at least 30 times by now and her expressions still make me cry, they're just so sincere. I don't know how else to put it.  As for Adam Sandler I think that this is his best role yet, he's a real person in this movie not just some overgrown immature goofball.  On top of everything it's a brilliant 80s satire, for me its right up there with American Psycho. I understand why someone would have reservations about watching this movie but my advice would be to put your cynicism aside for a couple of hours and just watch with an uncritical mind.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",
    "You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding! <br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",
    "A Gen Z update to Kathryn Bigelow's 1991 cult classic, this remake is essentially an episode of Fast and Furious in which the vehicular exploits have been replaced with an assortment of extreme sports sequences. Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clichéd stinkers like \"the only law is gravity\" and \"everyone dies, it's just a matter of how\", it's nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi. The same can't be said for low-budget-Chris-Hemsworth hunk Luke Bracey though, who is so wooden as Johnny Utah he makes Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis. This modern update boasts a handful of genuinely fantastic action sequences, yet they're not enough to warrant a recommendation in what is otherwise a limp and incoherent thriller.",
    "Due to alot of negative reviews on this site I did not expect the movie to be as good as it was.  However after watching it this evening I was delighted by the entire experience.  While I agree that it goes along with the \"ducks\" formula it deviates from it by not showing us the final game with the final ten seconds for the team to win.  It spared us that and just let us know with the final credits that the team won.  I thought the performances in the movie were excellent, although even I (living here in the deep south) found the accents of the children a little difficult to comprehend.  As for the overall effect of the movie it entranced me, completely, I kept having to rewind scenes to view them again and again. And, more importantly, if anyone ever doubted Keanu's ability to act then one should only view the eulogy scene to know that his critics have been simply barking up the wrong tree.  Strong, emotional, sympathetic and completely believable... speaking as as part time amateur actress, do you know how hard it is to cry, and cry believably?  Do you know how hard it is to make your chin tremble..? My conversion to Mel Gibson fan was watching him \"cry\" in Lethal Weapon... this has been my reconversion to Keanu fan..., to cry so believably in a movie is worth quids in my book and to be able to express emotion in such a way is worth any amount of praise.  Wonderful movie.  Go see it.",
    "I've watched this film for the third time in a few years last night. Instead of writing a straight review, I'd like to jot down ten thoughts just off the top of my head concerning this exquisite movie: <br/><br/>1) Watching this film will change forever your perception of the bank heist genre, making you question the contrived cinematic conventions these films usually make use of.<br/><br/>2) The source of this film's paradoxical and/or farcical elements spring from life itself, not from film or pre-existing cinematic conventions. Sometimes, the absurdities of life are so great, they dwarf those included in any form of fiction. Without even trying to make that point, this film captures that concept beautifully. <br/><br/>3) Its tone in relation to the homosexual theme is ahead of its time. In fact it's ahead of OUR time, even, in hardly making an issue out of it at all - it just IS. <br/><br/>4) It captures the climate of the 70s in a manner so sober, you'll remember its unshowy yet authentic feel forever.<br/><br/>5) Lumet's film brings to life the concept of the distorting lens of the media and how different groups with different agendas will turn an outlaw into a hero, with far more efficiency than Oliver Stone's brash, bloated, childish and repetitive Natural Born Killers.<br/><br/>6) Watching this film will illustrate to the younger generations exactly why Al Pacino has earned himself the legendary status he probably no longer would deserve with his performances of the last 10 years alone. **SPOILERS**: Just watch those last ten minutes of him handcuffed against the bonnet of a car, where he doesn't say a word, but speaks volumes with his eyes and his soul just oozing out of every frame at the end of the movie; you'll remember those eyes for as long as you live! <br/><br/>7) Watching this film, you'll realise that firing a gun-shot is a BIG DEAL in real life, and that other films make too much use of gun fire in a highly contrived way. <br/><br/>8) All that tension deriving from pointed guns unable to fire a shot OR move away you realise Tarantino must've taken notes sometime along the way. <br/><br/>9) No genre is old or done too many times before if it's handled with this amount of freshness, inspiration and talent. <br/><br/>10) Watching Dog Day Afternoon for the third time has filled me with the same amount of wonder at the power of truly inspired but unobtrusive film-making as it did first time round.",
    "Like many of you, the first time I saw the trailer for The Lego Movie (2014) I thought to myself, \"Are you kidding me?!\" Yet another movie based on a franchise of toys aimed towards families willing to cough up the cash just to shut their kids up. Can't we for once make movies for kids that don't dull the senses? Have we truly come to the point where there are no original thoughts? Yet after seeing not just families but college kids' line up to see sold out viewings I became interested. In addition, The Lego Movie managed to muster a staggering 93% on rottentomatoes.com, an unheard of fresh score in the February film graveyard. In short; curiosity got the best of me.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong about this film. I honestly couldn't have been more wrong about a film in my life. The Lego Movie is not only the must see film of the late winter season, I'm going to go ahead and call it now; it's the best family-oriented film for all ages of 2014. Okay maybe not but at the very least it's a very high bar to set.<br/><br/>The story busts out of the gate from the get-go; Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) a wizard and \"master builder\", while protecting a mystery weapon is blinded by Lord Business (Will Ferrell), obviously our caped and big booted villain. Before Vitruvius is kicked into the abyss by Business and his robotic minions, he foretells of a hero, the \"special\" who will put an end to his dastardly plans, whatever they might be. The next morning Emmet a seemingly ordinary Lego construction worker goes about his normal day. He comes across a woman named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) searching for \"the piece of resistance\" which he unwittingly finds and becomes beholden to. Now it's up to Emmet and some newfound friends to fulfill the prophecy.<br/><br/>It all sounds like a scenario dreamed up by a child who's read one too many comic books. Yet within The Lego Movie's brick-blocked world, everything including the story feels incredibly new and original. Children, especially the young will enjoy the fast action, laugh-a-minute jokes, sly slapstick and goofy characters. Obvious kid favorites will include perma-smiled Unikitty (Alison Brie) and zany 80's throwback astronaut Benny (Charlie Day) whose ability to create spaceships is frustratingly overlooked. Plus there's Batman (Will Arnett)Batman! <br/><br/>The older crowd however will be astounded not only with the seamless CGI effects but with the subversive element throughout the film. Yes a goofy, kiddy film of such unrestrained chirpiness can be positively incendiary, at least in this case. Throughout the film there are Orwellian elements tucked underneath crafty pop-culture references ranging from Star Wars (1977) to Harry Potter. There are mischievous pokes at what Henry David Thoreau referred to as \"(leading) lives of quite desperation.\" <br/><br/>Finally there's cheeky satire aimed at the Danish toy brand itself. Much of the conflict revolves around \"master builders\" who build whatever they want out of the parts they find versus Lord Business who wants everything built \"according to the directions.\" This particular theme struck the kid inside me as I was very fond of Legos. Younglings may not realize that back in the day, pre-designed Lego play sets took a back seat to the now impossible to find Lego Creative Bucket sets. To the uninitiated that particular red bucket set was an amalgam of potential foot sores but to this writer, those 200+ pieces were a gateway to an unlimited creative space.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie accurately and effectively recreates that creative space through accessible movie magic. It exhibits a fun hero story that may not be treading new narrative ground but nonetheless feels fresh and new. Finally the themes and occasionally biting humor makes The Lego Movie a kid's film that isn't just for kids but the child in all of us. This February do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an adventure story unlike any other. Then go home and order some Legos online! I know I am.",
    "Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987) is more than a sequel to a cult classic film from The Evil Dead (1981) this film is more of a prequel to the Army of Darkness (1992) that was made 5. years later. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is my number 1 favorite film best Evil Dead movie in the franchise. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. I love this film to death and I love it so damn much. I enjoy this film a lot, it is one of my favorite movie's in the trilogy. <br/><br/>This is a great movie fun gory entertaining kick-ass sequel. It has action, comedy and horror mixed together that is why I love this film to death! Bruce Campbell is pure fun bad-ass Ash I absolutely love him in this sequel. I miss the 80's and that really best action gory movies un like they are today.<br/><br/>This sequel to the original movie is the perfect balance between the horror of the original and the silliness of the third installment. It succeeds because it has fun with the \"B\" movie genre, never claiming to be better than it is while employing witty direction and dialogue. The scene I remember most is when blood splashes on the lightbulb, making the room glow red. <br/><br/>The first time I watch it, this film really confused me a lot because I thought it was sequel to The Evil Dead but it had a lot of changes, which I love that. I have enjoyed a lot of this film, it is one of my second favorite movie's of the trilogy. Bruce Campbell is pure fun and it's witty. Don't get me wrong I love both of Evil Dead films, but I just prefer Army of Darkness more, because it has funny scenes and it has a happy ending, those two films doesn't have happy endings, that is why I love Army of Darkness much better. The film it is just more of the same thing. Literally. But don't take that as such a negative thing. With the success of the low-budget original under his belt, director Sam Raimi re-imagined his first draft and added many elements he just did not have either the time or the money to accomplish on the first pass. On some level, the film certainly works as a nightmare that has to be replayed by our poor reluctant hero Ash. second Evil pairing of writer-director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell doesn't pick up from where the first Evil Dead left off, it instead reinvents some of the same characters from the first film, notably Campbell's daffy hero Ash and putative girlfriend Linda (played by Denise Bixler in this film), and plops them back in the same basic plot setup as the first film, in a kind of horror-comedy Groundhog Day scenario.<br/><br/>Once again Ash visits an isolated cabin in the woods, turns on a tape recorder that has a professor spouting verbiage from the Necronomicon, and the next thing you know, all hell has broken loose, quite literally. Raimi is a director who may not win points for finesse, but he works in a manic, breathless style that is perfectly suited for the outré black comedy of the Evil Dead franchise, and that devil may care, throw caution to the wind spirit is what has made the Evil Dead trilogy (Army of Darkness was the third film, though there's evidently a Raimi-Campbell remake of the original Evil Dead in the offing) such a cult sensation and what continues to draw audiences to the films to this day. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is an extremely gruesome affair, but it's also laugh out loud hilarious a lot of the time, with Campbell's intentionally arch delivery and wide-eyed crazed, cartoonish performance style making the most of Raimi and co-scenarist Scott Speigel's reinvention of the Evil Dead premise. <br/><br/>Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is really a sly, if sometimes sinister, comedy, one blacker than, well, death, but which delivers some consistent guffaws mixed in with the more typical \"avert your eyes\" blood and guts.<br/><br/>Ash (Bruce Campbell), the sole survivor of THE EVIL DEAD, returns to the same cabin in the woods and again unleashes the forces of the dead. With his girlfriend possessed by the demons and his body parts running amok, Ash is forced to single- handedly battle the legions of the damned as the most lethal - and groovy - hero in horror movie history! Welcome to EVIL DEAD II, director Sam Raimi's infamous sequel to THE EVIL DEAD and outrageous prequel to ARMY OF DARKNESS!<br/><br/>Evil Dead II (referred to in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is a 1987 American horror comedy film directed by Sam Raimi and a parody sequel to the 1981 film The Evil Dead. The film was written by Raimi and Scott Spiegel (they wrote the screenplay during the production of another collaboration Crimewave), produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams.<br/><br/>I love this film and Army of Darkness!!!!",
    "SPOILER ALERT a very good movie all the way through the 2 hours plus...until the killing of tom robbins's character.all he had to say was \"let me take you where i threw the child-molestor's body\".if he w a n t e d to die,then that was not made clear.after that, we don't see any confusion or grief  in sean penn's face when he hears they found the real murderers.the discussion with kevin bacon is so underplayed,like they do not really care or they are relieved the movie ended.what about arresting him?or okay if he doesn't  want to, what about bacon's partner laurence fishburne?he was the driving force trying to find the murderer and questioning bacon's priorities.what happened to him?he disappears leaving sean penn's character almost smiling at the end.where is the grief for killing his friend or for his daughter?and laura linney?i am sorry for what they did to you.such a talented actress.but who could pull it off, the monologue she gives at the end when we do not know anything about her character and what made her react like this.all the psychological journey we are experiencing through out the movie from a director who seems to value the human condition prepares us for a climax,a purge (of some kind at least).instead, we are left with an ending with full of questions and more important with a \"who cares\" mentality that destroys the prior two hours.it could have been a great movie.will the dvd have an alternative ending?(not a \"good\" one necessarily,but a better one).just joking.i am sorry for any grammar errors but english is not my first language.but movies are.",

This is one of those rarest cases when a bunch of talented and truly, but truly dedicated people set out to create something beautiful, some chemistry occurs and ... a miracle happens. Fortunately for all of us, this miracle immortalized on film.<br/><br/>Throughout the human history, the wisdom of generation was conveyed through fairy tales. This tale is no exception. This story, told in magic simplicity, actually has some deep philosophical meanings. While mercilessly debunking the true nature of human beings, this tragic story really tears your heart, and yet it fills it with hope. That is the true and, perhaps, the only purpose of art, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Why do we need music, painting, theatre, poetry? Is there a real excuse for their existence? To me, the only purpose, the only excuse is to help people go on, to give them hope. And it's well worth it!<br/><br/>To sum up, easily Tim Burton's best, this film is a masterpiece, my favorite American movie, and probably one of the best movies of all times. 10/10",
    "William Shakespeare's famous tragedy is brought to the screen on a large scale. Full of his intricate and unique style of writing, this play focuses on Macbeth.\n....\nWhat I did not expect to see is that the landscape of Scotland becomes not just the scenery background but one of the main storytelling streams. One sees too many modern adaptations of Japanese interpretation of Macbeth that one seems to forget where the story came from in the first place. Truly magnificent cinematography in this version of Macbeth and it really lives up to bloodbath on the battlefields as stated in the Bard' s words. One of the best movies in 2015",
    "I didn't expect this to mirror how my ex wife and I had to go through the stages of divorce so accurately. My son was only 2 when we were divorced and all of the ups and downs and petty fights and anger that we had for each other was exhausting but we went through it all just to fight for him, who we both love more than anything. We said horrible things to each other we can never take back but we didn't really mean and we both eventually found a way to make it work for him and to protect him from the ugliness. We made it through to the other side and have a good relationship now and work as a team to raise him with love and support but it was a long road out of hell to get there. This movie portrayed that in a way I would never have expected. It made me cry numerous times thinking of how hopeless and angry I was for so long and in that I feel like this movie deserves every accolade it gets. It felt genuine and painful but with hope at the end. It's real and powerful.",
    "I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, i was simply compelled to watch it until the end. I already knew how it ended so i was surprised it commanded my attention so intensely.<br/><br/>The fact is the characters were all so realistically portrayed and the film was so expertly directed that it was almost as if the Apollo 13 disaster was filmed and that is what i was watching.<br/><br/>Now this film is certainly not to everyone's taste, it is quite slow in the build up and the film relies almost entirely on the script and ability of the cast.<br/><br/>If you like your disaster films loud and in your face then this is probably not for you, but if you like them realistic (slightly dramatised) then watch it and be astounded.<br/><br/>9/10",
    "It takes a while for your eyes to get used to the uncanny animation, but once you overcome the ordeal, Beowulf turns into an outrageously entertaining ride. The performances are solid, the visuals are unique, the score is uplifting, and it has great action sequences. It's really good fun for adults of all ages.",
    "How many times do I need to read other's reviews on disaster films before I remember most people on here writing these think they are actual film critics? It is a disaster movie. Yes, the science is terrible. Yes the coincidences are fantastical. If you watch these for ground breaking stories with rich plots, or for an Oscar worthy performance by one of the actors, then you are watching these for the wrong damn reasons.\nThis movie shows a future where due to the rise in global temperatures, a modern ice age is triggered. How it is ushered in is by these violent, giant hurricane-like storms that cause flash freezing, and bring in a myriad of disasters with them. These include tsunamis and blizzards that drop so many feet of snow that people are walking level with the signs on the interstate that you would normally drive under. It also tries to throw in a lot of relatable human elements, such as the struggle of a man that is an absentee parent because of his job, trying to connect with his son, a lonely boy dying of cancer, and just the human death that this kind of disaster would bring.\nDo not watch this for the science, though I do feel that they had the causation of another ice age correct. Do not watch this for deep plot. Watch this for the enjoyable ride on which it takes you.",
    "What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! <br/><br/>I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.<br/><br/>Back to the Future (1985) <br/><br/>From the Academy Award \"- winning team of Steven Spielberg\" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.<br/><br/>At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car \"DeLorean\". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.<br/><br/>After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.<br/><br/>What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.<br/><br/>They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.<br/><br/>More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost \"chewed every scenes\" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.<br/><br/>Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs \"The Power of Love,\" and \"Earth Angel\".<br/><br/>The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as \" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! \"",
    "At this point, \"Darkest Hour\" has an overall rating of 5.3. I do not understand this at all, but the film has not actually been released yet and has only been seen in film festivals. I assume the overall score will increase considerably--especially since the two reviews for it were quite positive.<br/><br/>Now I must point out that I am a retired history teacher and I consider Winston Churchill to be perhaps the greatest politician of the century. So, I clearly have a bias and predisposition towards liking the movie...especially if it's done well. Is it a crowd pleaser? Maybe not, as the average movie-goer (especially teens) might not enjoy this or care a lick about the film.<br/><br/>The story covers only a portion of the month of May, 1940...just before the fall of France during WWII. Prime Minster Chamberlain is about to be tossed out of office, as his appeasement strategy with Hitler has turned out to be completely stupid. In his place, some hope for Churchill to be the next Prime Minister...though some forces are working to depose him as soon as he comes to power. At the same time, the war is going as badly as it possibly can. Can Churchill survive this? Well, of course...duh, it's HISTORY!<br/><br/>The reasons to see this are two big ones....the film has achieved the look of 1940 beautifully and Gary Oldman provides an Oscar- winning performance in the lead. If he is not at least nominated for this top award, I will be completely shocked...and he really managed (along with ample prosthetics) to LOOK and SOUND like the great man. Great job all around...and a perfect film.",
    "Here is the review my wife and I wrote for cincity2000.com <br/><br/>Talladega Superspeedway. For those unfamiliar, it is NASCAR's biggest and fastest race track, and the setting for the latest Will Ferrell comedy Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. I'm no fan of professional racing, but I do know funny. Put Will Ferrell in the driver's seat of a stock car, cast John C. Reilly (so wonderful in Chicago) as his best friend, and pit Sacha Baron Cohen (best known as Ali G.) as his rival and you can be almost guaranteed a good movie.<br/><br/>Here's the dealRicky Bobby (Will Ferrell) is born in the backseat of a souped-up Chevelle. His motivation in life is given to him when he is ten years old by his alcoholic father: \"If you ain't first, you're last.\" This mantra carries him to the pit crew of a losing race team. When he's given the chance to finish a race, Ricky shows that there isn't much he won't do to win. Teamed with his best friend Cal Naughton, Jr. (Reilly) they become 'Shake and Bake' and go on to NASCAR super-stardom. Ricky has the perfect life. A sexy wife, a family, riches. Enter Jean Girard (Cohen), a flamboyant Frenchman who begins to unravel Ricky's perfect world by beating him on and off the track. Ricky is forced to deal with his own fears. And a cougar.<br/><br/>What's this, you say? A Comedy? Sounds more like the 'feel good' movie of the summer! Perhaps I failed to mention that Jean Girard is a gay married man (Andy Richter plays his husband in a decidedly underwritten role) who sips espresso while he races. Or that Ricky and his wife Carley (the hot Leslie Bibb) have two delinquent sons named Walker and Texas Ranger. And how about the cougar? Oh, I know I mentioned the cougar! All this and more mixes together very well under the comedic eye of Adam McKay, who wrote (along with Ferrell) and directed.<br/><br/>Talladega Nights takes the whole All-American-Dream concept and makes it funny. It's Rudy with belly laughs. Better yet, it's the Anchorman of car racing, which makes sense since McKay did that movie, too. A lot of the scenes felt improvised, but by seasoned professionals. And with a great cast that included Gary Cole and Amy Adams, the jokes were constant and seamless. From an extended dinner grace addressed to 'tiny, baby, Christmas Jesus' to Molly Shannon's portrayal of the drunken wife of the team owner, the movie never failed to make you laugh. As an added bonus, this movie also has some great action. The race sequences were very believable and the crashes were amazing.<br/><br/>To be completely fair, there were moments when some of the scenes dragged a little. And some characters you will not like as much as others. But all in all, an enjoyable, laugh out loud experience for anyone 13 years and up. Shake and Bake, baby!",
    "I was supposed to be be seeing either Flight or Argo today, but to my disappointment I missed both showtimes, and I was in a tight time frame where I could see anything. So my friend really convinced me to check this one out. Boy, what a great time it was.<br/><br/>Wreck-It Ralph is really wonderfully created. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing. The world it builds, and all of the little details from various video games, is pretty wonderful to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this gloriously colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, the characters are all lively and written with skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a simple kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw had been sure to let audiences know just how \"pretty\" this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals. The voice performances are pretty incredible, and perhaps because I recognized such people like Reily, Silverman, McBrayer, and Lynch, but even others did wonders with their characters. <br/><br/>Overall, the film follows a clear pattern and formula for kids, but the real surprise is that none of it made me roll my eyes or cringe. It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectable manner, and the film hits greatness in the writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design. The only real flaw in it that I gathered was the inclusion of a Rihanna song, which really took me out of the world the film created and kinda put a plaster on it from pop culture. Or maybe it's because I hate the song... Still, this is another truly great animated film that does stand out from others this year in its own way, and one that's admirable and satisfying in all the best ways. I loved it. Highly recommended.",
    "There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.<br/><br/>The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.<br/><br/>You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless. <br/><br/>The King's Speech boasts an exceptional cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.<br/><br/>The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year.",
    "Why the poor box office performance?  Why the bad reviews?  Why the bad word of mouth?  I really didn't see anything horrible about this movie!  First of all, it's a character-driven story.  There's little subplots involving jealousy and philandering, but it's not handled in a soapy fashion.  I didn't feel any of the characters were one-dimensional.<br/><br/>\nOf course, Mike Myers steals the show as the homosexual club owner Steve Rubell.  I don't know the real Steve Rubell, so you be the judge whether or not his performance was accurate, but I have to say that Myers did an incredible job!  And I'm not overstating the least bit!  You watch him in this movie and you totally forget that this is the same guy who played Austin Powers.  Not to say I didn't realize Myers had talent prior to watching this film.  He has definitely proven that he has talent as a comic actor, but I didn't know he had the chops to pull off a straight, dramatic role.  Even his accent sounds real, not the least bit phony.  I'm surprised Myers didn't even get an Oscar nod.  He should've at least gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Trust me--you will be blown away by his performance in this movie!<br/><br/>The music is great.  It's always great to reminisce to the great songs from the seventies.  Mark  Christopher nicely captured the whole rebellious atmosphere of 54.  We're given a taste of the drug addiction and even the sexual promiscuity that made the place famous--there's a scene where a couple shamelessly pounds away on the balcony.  I read one person's review, saying that this movie should've been an hour longer.  I find it ironic that people watch movies that are two and a half to three hours long and complain, \"Oh, this movie dragged!  Oh, this movie needed more editing!\" Yet they watch a succintly timed film like this and complain it's too short. This may not have been the most thorough examination of the famous nightclub, but I think it got to the point.  No reason why we have to go into every tiny detail.<br/><br/>This is a serious, dramatic film but it's also very entertaining.  I actually had a smile on my face when the movie ended.  It ended on a happy note without having that forced, schmaltzy Hollywood feel.  Plus, I really like that song \"Knock on Wood\" that they played over the credits.<br/><br/>\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",
    "Last week, as I considered ordering this DVD, I checked the IMDB rating and saw a \"fair\" 6.5.  Since I like Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson, I placed the order. Like most roller coasters, I found it to be a good ride and Jones and Jackson did very credible jobs.  The flaws in the movie have been correctly pointed out by numerous other reviewers.  I was somewhat surprised that some of the most critical reviews were by US viewers.  I fully understand how non-US citizens would be irritated by the stereotypes. I found it to be a very exciting movie from my particular perspective (US citizen, military family, male over 45). The scenes of combat when the marines are ordered to the US embassy in Yemen to safeguard our state department personnel were VERY well done, even to the point of gripping.  The court scenes and conflicts of evidence or lack of evidence were interesting to me and I also understood, but did not agree with, the aims of the State Department.  I don't think some of the reviewers are aware of what a person might do in such an extremely stressful situation as that of Colonel Childers (Jackson).  It was fascinating to me to see what he did do and how he and others looked back on it.  I would have given Rules of Engagement a 9 or 10, but for the flaws. It's a good movie though and well worth renting.  It's an 8.",
    "12 Years a Slave tells the true story of Solomon Northup, an educated and free black man living in New York during the 1840's who gets abducted, shipped to the south, and sold into slavery. It is a film that stimulates at both an emotional level and an intellectual one. <br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup. He's been a \"that guy\" actor for sometime – film-goers may know his face but not his name. After this film his name will be known. He gives, quite simply, the best performance from a leading actor since Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Because of his character's position as a slave he is usually unable to speak his mind unless he is prepared to be beaten. As a result Ejiofor is forced to utilize body language and his eyes, which become enormous pools of emotion to express himself to the audience. He's forced to endure terrible things, but he always maintains a certain dignity and nobility that makes his plight even more affecting. It's a performance of incredible subtlety that may leave you speechless and in complete awe.<br/><br/>Micheal Fassbender gives the best performance of his already extremely impressive career, even besting his previous high marks from the films Shame and Hunger (both directed by Steve McQueen, who also directed 12 Years a Slave). He plays Edwynn Epps, a vicious and demonic slaver and perhaps the most loathsome and disgusting character ever put on screen. If alive today, he'd likely be a drunk with severe anger management issues. By turns pathetic and terrifying, he embodies the ultimate nightmare of a deeply flawed man given absolute power over other human beings, and through that absolute power finds only madness, which drives him to deeper cruelty. He's always a menacing and malignant presence even when not on screen, as his slaves must always be aware and prepared for his seemingly random bouts of sadism. <br/><br/>Other actors give excellent performances as well. Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Paulson, Alfre Woodard are all great in relatively small roles. But in this film of titans it's the one you've probably never heard of who perhaps stands above them all. In her first role in a feature film, Lupita Nyong'o, playing the pretty young slave Patsey - the object of Edwynn Epps demented and horrifying affections and the emotional epicenter of the entire picture, gives one of the most devastating performances I have ever seen. A portrait of unbearable sadness, her character is a mirror image of Solomon. While Solomon is a man who refuses to break and give up the dignity which he's known since birth, she is one who has long since been broken, and who never knew dignity in the first place. Her life is a living hell, forced to endure the \"love\" of Edwyn Epps and the brutal jealousy of his wife, she's trapped in a terrible triangle that she can't escape. Despite that, she retains a level of innocence that only heightens the tragedy of her character. It actually gets to the point where simply looking at this character might be enough to bring you to tears. It's a shattering performance.<br/><br/>Starting his career as a video artist before making full length films, Steve McQueen has an uncanny eye for imagery and contrast. He's also a very patient film maker, utilizing long, steady single shots to emphasize various things. In his prior films this has felt like a purely stylistic choice, here, it's a choice aimed directly at our heart. When the events on screen become their most horrifying and ugly is when his camera becomes the most unflinching. At times feeling perhaps like we're seeing out of the solemn eyes of the ghost of some murdered slave, watching in sorrow and rage. This is both McQueen's most accessible and artistically searing film yet. <br/><br/>There are also moments of stunning natural beauty that would make Terrence Malick proud. Alone, these shots would inspire wonder, but in the context of this film they make us feel more forlorn, as if the ugliness of man is encroaching on the natural beauty of the world.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most noteworthy thing about 12 Years a Slave is the way that it portrays slavery itself. Instead of taking the easy way out and limiting his exploration of the topic solely to the slaves, Steve McQueen increases the scope and we see how it affects those who profited by it. Take Benedict Cumberbatch's character. A seemingly decent and caring man who treats his slaves with some semblance of respect and kindness. He comes off as a relatively good man who is trapped within the powerful confines of the institution of slavery. In 12 Years a Slave, slavery is shown as a horrifying and destructive social construct that drains the humanity from everyone it touches, turning good men into moral quandaries, turning flawed men into monsters, and turning an entire race of people into livestock and tools. <br/><br/>To watch 12 Years a Slave is to be confronted with the grim reality of slavery in a way that's never been done before. To say this is the best film ever made about slavery feels trivial, as slavery is a subject in film that has been shown with naive romanticism from films like Gone With the Wind or silly exploitation from something like Django Unchained. Both of which serve to make the topic digestible. To watch 12 Years a Slave is to experience a level of despair and misery that can become overwhelming. It's a film of such ugliness, such blunt emotional trauma, that it may haunt you for hours if not days after seeing it. So why should you watch a film that could leave you reeling and devastated? Because, it's also one of the greatest cinematic achievements of our time.",
    "Mathew McConaughey is Brandon Lane, a former football star recruited by Walter Abraham (Al Pacino), the head of a sports consulting firm to help them set the line for their sports betting business. Lane's ability to predict the outcome of games quickly turns him into a golden boy, but it soon becomes apparent that he's bitten off more than he can chew when his abilities start to falter.<br/><br/>Two for the Money is a forgettable, generic thriller that doesn't really offer anything new. The film does have some entertaining moments and the first half of the movie is actually pretty exciting to watch. But, the second half is really slow and very tedious. It just drags on and on and for no reason either. It could have been a nice 90 minute movie but the story is stretched out into a two hour film. Luckily, Al Pacino is in the movie and he keeps the film exciting. He gives a good, over the top performance and he pretty much raises the film up to mediocrity. Personally, sports betting isn't that interesting to me but Al Pacino makes it interesting. He can turn a bad script into an okay movie which is what he does with the film. Let's be honest, the script is not very good and the direction is weak. It's so obvious where things are going which is not surprising because this is the same guy that made Taking Lives.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is playing mentor to Matthew McConaughey and their chemistry together isn't very strong. McConaughey is a pretty weak actor and he can't keep up with Pacino. The lead role should have gone to someone else. Rene Russo is okay as Pacino's wife. She gives a decent performance but she was a little too bland to truly stand out. Another thing about the film that people may not like is that every character is unlikable. It's hard to care for these characters because they are either pretty mean or bland. It didn't really bother me because I watched the film to be entertained and I did get some entertainment value from the movie. In the end, if you like Al Pacino then you should give the film a shot, if you don't then just skip it. Rating 6/10",
    "I found myself really enjoying SULTAN. Ali knows how to push all the right buttons to keep the audience engaged. Ali's writing and directing are flawless. This is without a doubt Ali's best ever movie. Nushki is an acting diva and she is making her way to be the next great actress since Aishwarya Rai. I love love love Nushki, I truly adore her and always will. She's my love ;) xxx I must confess that I could watch Nushki in almost anything, but here she really delivers a performance that may be her best yet . . . and I've seen almost all of her work. Nushki elevates herself to a league of her own. She is a beautiful girl who is talented enough when playing \"regular\" characters, such as the journalist in \"PK\". But as a high profile corporate executive in \"NH10\" and in this film as a musclebound wrestler, she takes it to a level most female actors couldn't. You can tell how hard she worked to make this role believable because when she wrestles you forget it is Anushka Sharma in the ring. SK is always a pleasure to watch. Here his character's sizzling chemistry with Nushki is completely adorable and that moments of sweetness will surely MELT your heart. SK gives an incredible performance that will undoubtedly propel his career. Overall it is one motion picture that should never be missed nor put aside when selecting movies to be seen on a weekend. SULTAN is a sure winner for all.",
    "I saw a sold-out opening night screening of \"Across the Universe\" last night with a group of my friends who had really been looking forward to it. Many of them were extremely disappointed, while in the critical world, Roger Ebert and the New York Times loved it. Because the film was so highly anticipated, and a number of people have asked me how I liked it, I'm writing this review in an attempt to express why the movie is so divisive. I'm not going to talk about plot, or describe any of the numbers. If you're interested in seeing the movie, they'll be more enjoyable if they're unexpected.<br/><br/>It's a bizarre and beautiful movie musical, almost a music video at times, that uses thirty- three of The Beatles' songs and director Julie Taymor's unique visual style to illustrate both a personal love story and the overall conflict in the sixties. The movie is incredibly original and ambitious, and therefore its failings are as dramatic as its successes. Both stem from the same source: Julie Taymor's self-indulgence. That's nothing new to her movies, \"Frida\" and \"Titus\" have the same problem, but in a movie stripped of traditional narrative, it's glaringly obvious. Some songs are impeccably chosen and staged with great creativity, but others are too obvious, or thematically forced so Taymor can cram in another song and stunning visual sequence.<br/><br/>For the first half of the movie, I was frequently divided. One innovative sequence would really pull me into the style, then a forced number or awkward staging would distance me again. When an obvious, recognizable number began, I was torn between a cynical impulse to roll my eyes and an almost exhilarated impulse to laugh and applaud.<br/><br/>\"Across the Universe\" is a mess. There's no denying that. It is poorly paced and badly structured, and at times its feather-light plot and contrived or obligatory numbers become tedious. But at one point, about halfway through, I decided just to go along for the ride. I delighted in every brash, bold choice, whether it worked or not. I let the poignant moments move me, whether or not I intellectually felt that they were contrived.<br/><br/>The Beatles' music had a huge effect on me; from the fateful day that my friend accidentally copied the first three tracks of \"Revolver\" onto my computer, a love affair was born. Their songs are inexorably tied to memories beautiful and horrible scattered all over my life, and as I grow older, I'm constantly discovering new, deeper resonances in their familiar refrains. Even when the context was vague or stretched, the film's reinterpreting and revealing new facets of these songs seemed to serve as a tribute to their breadth and greatness. Taymor's damning depiction of the horrors of war, and lyrical portrait of young, idealistic love are both painfully expressive and unique, and simply took my breath away. By the film's shamelessly corny close, I realized that I had just had a genuine cinematic experience. For all the movies that I watch, that's incredibly rare.<br/><br/>In his review in the New York Times, Stephen Holden writes, \"I realized that falling in love with a movie is like falling in love with another person. Imperfections, however glaring, become endearing quirks once you've tumbled.\" I could laughingly list this movie's flaws from now till next week, but I sort of fell in love with its sheer audacity. You might not. It's extremely naïve, and thematically simple, and you could find that endearing or irritating. You may love it, or you may hate it, but you're going to feel something. This movie will not change your life; don't expect it to. But if you let your criticism fade to the background, and abandon yourself to Taymor's passionate fervor, you may have a pretty amazing experience.",
    "After being subjected to a number of films documenting the lives of musicians - most notably \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Rocketman\" and \"Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story\" - it is truly a pleasure to be presented with a film that sheds light on the work and life of an artist while not adhering to the strict (though desirable) biographical approach. That is exactly what makes the piece so marvellous; I came out of the cinema with a greater appreciation of The Beatles, and their music, through a fictional story that did not feature the four men we are familiar with at all. Quite often the film achieved my admiration for the band without me consciously noticing.<br/><br/>On another level, the film made a satire of the modern music industry. It revealed how the apparent \"solo\" artists are far from their titles; with huge teams of people pushing them in a preferred, and more commercial, creative direction, taking the musicians' creative power. This was done in a humorous light (as most themes are presented in the film). The romantic aspect of the film is evident from the beginning and is a dominant aspect of the story, possibly shifting the focus of the piece a little too much. However, it still helps provides a satisfying ending.<br/><br/>The film pays a great amount of respect in a fresh way while cleverly interweaving other conflicts.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "The fact that the movie is based on a true story contributes to a better and, of course, more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the movie. The story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps the viewer at all times from figuring the ending out. In one moment you think that something happens to Coach Jones or Radio. Well it does, but certainly not what you'd expect.<br/><br/>The film becomes at no point boring or too sentimental and the acting performances by Ed Harris & Cuba Gooding Jr. are some of their best in my opinion. The ending puts a long lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right. Well I guess that was what Michael Tollin & Mike Rich were trying to do. First-class movie.<br/><br/>Esbjørn Nordby Birch. Denmark.",
    "SPOILER: This movie was just magical.<br/><br/>The Force has become like Harry Potter magic, with a new spell every day or so.<br/><br/>Rey is just magical. With practically training whatsoever she can take on Luke and Kylo and win.<br/><br/>Snoke is magical. He appeared out of nowhere in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi has such fantastic Force powers (never before seen in the entire Star Wars Universe) and yet can't tell when his protege is scheming to slice him in two (but could fell his every throught earlier, and even manipulate him and Rey's thoughts and get them to intergalactically Skype each other and even send water through space).<br/><br/>Luke is magical. He can magically project himself light years away and even bring solid things (the lucky dice) with him. Then dies magically for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Yoda is magical. His Force-ghost actually has more Force powers than when he was alive! Calling down lightning from the sky??? Heck, why don't the Jedi just do that when fighting on Tattooine or whatever? And if Force-ghosts still have Force powers why not the whole gang of Anakin, Ben and Yoda take on Snoke?<br/><br/>Rose is magical. She appears out of nowhere and just happens to go along with Finn on a completely unnecessary mission to find a code breaker, and find not one but TWO code breakers, one of which is in the SAME CELL as they are. I mean, is that magical or what?<br/><br/>Leia is magical. Previously in 7 movies only having the barest abilities in the Force, she now can survive in space for quite a long time and even open her eyes without getting them immediately frozen, and Force-Mary Poppins herself back to the space ship. Magical!<br/><br/>I could go on and on. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it's one shameless Deus Ex Machina after another. And don't even get me started on the stupid feminist nonsense, the inane attempt at comedy, the stupid characters who go nowhere in their characterisation, the stupid casino subplot, the stupid \"saving\" of Finn who wanted to sacrifice himself by Rose who magically now has feeling for him and both of them magically survive without getting shot at by the entire First Order army. Oops, I did go on and on.<br/><br/>If you make a movie, you need to make sure your movie stays in the universe it came from. Not invent new rules, new powers, new super villains, new behaviours from old characters, etc. out of bloody nowhere.",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "Once Jake Gyllenhaal signed on to do Nightcrawler I knew it would be a special film. The man has been producing nothing but gold lately and this is no different. Nightcrawler is an experience - it takes you on this journey through the grimy streets of LA, through the corrupt minds of media moguls, and everything is told through the eyes of seemingly charming slimeball reporter Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal). <br/><br/>Nightcrawler works on so many levels. The writing and direction is fantastic, which is especially impressive as it's the directorial debut by Dan Gilroy who takes on both duties. He had a clear vision of how he wanted to portray LA and the sleek, brooding yet slightly lackadaisical tone transfers perfectly onto the big screen. The acting is phenomenal - Gyllenhaal gives a performance that's the polar opposite from his character in Prisoners and he was on point for every second. He was the perfect casting choice to carry the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has a clear message on the media and how they abuse stories and reap the benefits regardless of who gets victimized. It's a message that has been told a million times before, but never quite like this. Nightcrawler throws you right into the gritty streets along with a hustling thief, Lou, who starts freelancing as a videographer of crime scenes and selling his footage to a news channel for money. We go along this journey with Lou and watch his transformation from being a sleazy but ambitious individual to becoming a manipulative, self-serving sociopath. Then you start to realize that he was like that all along. His charming charisma masked his true intentions, and this peek into his psyche is the most potent and disturbing aspect of the movie. It's a character study that encompasses an entire lifestyle, and told with enough elegance and wit to keep you on board the whole way.<br/><br/>There's a dark comedic tone present throughout. Lou's persistence and crass remarks to basically anyone he encounters provide some good laughs. He doesn't sugarcoat anything, he'll talk to anyone in order to get his way, and he has a sleazy smirk that never fails to get a reaction. Also Gyllenhaal's chemistry with Rene Russo (the news director) is palatable and their work dynamic becomes more of a gripping co-dependency as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>Nightcrawler is a must-watch for fans of cinema. It's a work of art from a directorial and writing standpoint, from an acting standpoint, and from a basic human nature standpoint. It really does a hell of a job at sucking you into this dark gloomy world to the point where you don't want to get out. It's intense, it's funny, it's thrilling, it's powerful, and most of all, it's real. Nightcrawler is simply sensational.",
    "The best film in the era of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Supremely well acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize. Great action scenes, big issue that touches past Bond and M which little is known. Sam Mendes does a masterful job directing this installment of James Bond. Realmete with this film you can compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly.",
    "Dawn of the Dead<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.<br/><br/>And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>Grade: A-",
    "Let me confess I'm not a Catholic, I don't have children, I can't stand schmaltz and yet I love The Sound Of Music. I've tried to explain this to myself, let alone to others, without ever finding a satisfactory answer. Yesterday I sat to see it again with a group of kids who hadn't seen it before. They all loved it even the ones who loved Transporters. I asked them afterwards why did they loved it so much and a 12 year old boy's reply was: \"It makes you feel alive\" Wow, I thought, Wow! Of course, that's what I felt too and a 12 year old found the perfect words to express my feelings. Julie Andrews is a the center of this little miracle. She is Sister Maria and her wishes, thoughts and fears are recognizable automatically, because they are, in many ways, my same wishes, thoughts and fears. Perfect. Thank you.",
    "Aliens (1986) is the best Epic Sci-Fi Classic Action Movie of all time and one of my personal favorite best action sci-fi flicks that I love to death. Just like I love The Terminator and T2, I love this movie to death. James Cameron's classic masterpiece. The now classic science fiction film was only the third feature directed by James Cameron (following Piranha Part Two, The Terminator). It is the sequel to the 1979 film Alien and Alien is a masterpiece I love that film, but I love this movie more sorry this is my personal opinion this is my movie. I am not saying it is better than the original movie but it is right up there with Alien a real classic. <br/><br/> Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the sole survivor from the original \"Alien\", returns to Earth after drifting trough space in hyper sleep for 57 years. Although her story about the Alien encounter is met with skepticism, she agrees to accompany a team of high-tech marines back to LV-426 and this time it's war! It has great cast I love the marines fighting aliens in this movie. The movie stars: Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, William Hope, Jenette Goldstein, Al Matthews, Mark Rolston , Ricco Ross, Colette Hiller, Daniel Kash ,Cynthia Dale Scott and Tip Tipping and they are all believable enough.<br/><br/>I love the characters beside Ellen Ripley, Newt, Corporal Hicks, Bishop, Private Hudson, Private Vasquez, Sergeant Apone, Private Drake, Private Frost, Corporal Ferro, Private Spunkmeyer, Corporal Dietrich, Private Crowe I love those platoon of US Colonial Marines I know I haven't mentioned Burke because he was the bad guy and I don't like him. But most of the characters in this movie I love. <br/><br/> I know it is a sci-fi action film but it also does a have a horror mixed together people just don't see that. There's plenty of horror in it. The nightmare sequence in the beginning, the creepy atmosphere of the LV-426 colony, and the heart pounding face hugger on the loose scene in the medical bay. You see mother of those aliens who cocooned all the humans and killed them you see Ripley finding the nest and fight the Alien queen on the end. Ripley faces her fear and gets over her PTSD by going in by herself to rescue the Girl/Fight the Aliens/and Destroy the Entire Nest...Battles One on One with an Alien Queen and Whips its' Ass...and, by the end, now both her and Newt can dream without the worry of any more Nightmares (which plagued Ripley at the beginning of the film).<br/><br/>This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1986!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores from James Horner of stuntmen used.<br/><br/>10/10 I have the Blu-ray disc which it also have a special edition version on it I used to had this film on DVD but I throw it away because I bought the Blu-ray which I am very happy about it. I love this film to death it is my personal favorite sci-fi action film even Lance Henriksen from Hard Target and The Terminator is in here and he is the good guy.",
    "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. <br/><br/>This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. <br/><br/>The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. <br/><br/>The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. <br/><br/>I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.",
    "Growing up, my favorite book was, easily, \"Charlie & the Chocolate Factory\". Roald Dahl's magical tale of a young boy's adventure in the strange factory was spell-binding. Though I never had a problem with the original \"Willy Wonka\" move with Gene Wilder (despite how unfaithful it was, it was still a cute and heart-warming movie), I was doing back-flips when I heard Tim Burton, quite possibly my all-time favorite director, would helm a new version of the movie.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka. What people don't really pick up from the first movie is that Wonka was intended to be, well, crazy. He was eccentric and freaky, the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child. Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka more like a fatherly-figure, and really was just too nice. Depp pulls out all of the stops as a new Willy Wonka, though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out.<br/><br/>What I loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book. Everything that was mentioned, from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee, was taken directly from the book. I was incredibly impressed.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie for everyone, especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts. Wonka chocolate bars for all!",
    "Is there a better person to play a cyborg than Arnold?  For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man.  His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine.  It's almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which I guess it is in one sense ). Terminator is one of those films that started something huge.  People didn't realize it at the time, but the careers of Arnold, Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn, Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film.  And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( Aliens ).<br/><br/>As we all know what the story is, I'll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it.  First I have to mention Michael Biehn.  He has the real starring role.  He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience.  He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why.  It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right.  But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him.  Biehn ( Kyle Reese ) replies \" Terminator's don't feel pain.  I do.  Don't do that again. \"  That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression, the perfect tone and the perfect timing.  Biehn is perfect for the role.<br/><br/>This is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say, but now that I am older, I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films.  And they are so passionate with what they have to say.  I like it when a film has something to say.  I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece.  This is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Finally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film.  One, this is the first film where \"I'll be back\" was spoken.  Now it is part of Arnolds vernacular.  Secondly, Bill Paxton is in it.  And he adds spark to any film that he's in.  Especially here, as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him, he has some great lines.<br/><br/>A great film.",
    "I am sorry for all the readers, but I don't know where to begin.<br/><br/>Let me say at first that I'm not a big Dan Brown fan, but I read Angels & Demons with great pleasure. The book deals a lot with the eternal question of Science vs. Religion and that made me think a lot about that subject again. That big battle is totally lost in the movie.<br/><br/>A lot of the important lines in the book (CERN, Maximilian Kohler, the scepsis of the Swiss Guard, the love relationship between Robert and Vittoria, the Hassassin, the relationship between the Camerlengo and the pope) are lost in the movie screenplay. This makes the movie a very cut-down and over-simplified version.<br/><br/>Would the movie be any good if I hadn't read the book? I still doubt it. From scene 3 on, the movie is a 'chase-movie' without interruption. There is no time for contemplation or depth. No story-line, no backgrounds. It's just a chase movie in a GREAT decorum.<br/><br/>You would think that with a running time of about 140 minutes a movie is able to bring more. Much more.",
    "It is too unbelievable and too lame. It is unfunny and like a cartoon that is on film.\nExaggeration is OK when it is interesting not when it is a spoof that takes itself seriously.",
    "I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.<br/><br/>\nIt is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. <br/><br/>As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see \"Hart's War\" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).<br/><br/>All in all, \"The Great Escape\" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",
    "Caution: spoilers may abound. I think this movie is severely underrated. Most complaints I see are of people who can't let go of the vision of superman they got from Christopher reeve who played a superman who was a god among men who never made mistakes and always knew what to do. That's not someone we relate to in this day and age because in our cynical and jaded society it's impossible to be that morally upright. I like Henry Cavill's superman because he plays a man who has to learn how to be superman. He's not perfect out the gate and he doesn't automatically know how to handle every situation right out the gate. Because of this a lot of lives are lost in the battle of metropolis and superman is forced to end zod because there is no other recourse because there is no way to contain him on earth with all the kryptonian tech is destroyed. Whatever you can say about how believable it is that superman didn't have a choice it's still set up well. Krypton was very beautiful and Russell Crowe made a great jor el. As far as the plot for the movie I understand the criticism that the flashbacks don't make sense but I think the death of Jonathan Kent is done very well because it's a sacrifice intended to keep Clark undercover. All in all its not perfect but it's far from terrible.",
    "To start off this review I'd like to say that before I ever watched this movie I had the opinion that it was going to be rubbish, solely because of how blown up the movie was. Everywhere I went it was \"The Greatest Showman\". I thought that perhaps it would be a mediocre film at best, blown out of proportion by a craze.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong. Even at the beginning of the movie you are thrown straight into the extravagance of what the movie was about to become. What is basically the story of a simple man becoming a legend in the show-business, is the most flamboyant and breath-taken musical movie I've seen. The soundtrack for this movie is beyond brilliant. Having been impressed by Hugh Jackman's vocals in Les Miserable I was not surprised he pulls it out of the bag in this movie yet again. But Zac Efron really stood out in this movie and that truly surprised me.<br/><br/>When you finish this movie you will have the great songs stuck in your head, and you will be fully satisfied having finished the movie, your next plan will likely be getting the soundtrack and reliving the magic all over again.",
    "This movie is 20 years old, but it's still the most enjoyable movie I've seen in ages. Why can't they make movies like this again?",
    "Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.<br/><br/>Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).<br/><br/>The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.<br/><br/>The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.<br/><br/>What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!",
    "People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. <br/><br/>What it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.<br/><br/>Now is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. <br/><br/>Now to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.<br/><br/>Why was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.<br/><br/>You should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.",
    "\"I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time\", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use \"the weapon\".<br/><br/>There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10",
    "I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.",
    "On the day that Shrek rescued the cursed Princess Fiona from the tower where she was kept prisoner of the dragon, her parents King Harold and the Queen were ready to sign a contract with the cunning Rumpelstiltskin delivering the kingdom Far Far Away to him. On the present days, Shrek feels bored with Fiona, his family and friends and near a breakdown, and he misses the years when he was a terrifying ogre. Rumpelstiltskin overhears a discussion between Shrek and Fiona and meets Shrek, offering a deal to make he feels a frightening ogre again. In return, Shrek should deliver one day of his childhood to Rumpelstiltskin. Shrek is lured and Far Far Away is distorted under the reign of the tricky Rumpelstiltskin. Now Shrek misses his family and friends and has to win Fiona's heart again to save Far Far Away, his friends and himself. <br/><br/>I have just watched \"Shrek Forever After\" and my expectations were very low, based on the IMDb user's rating and a couple of reviews that I had glanced. However I liked this underrated animation a lot, which has a good story with many hilarious moments. Once again, Donkey \"steals the movie\" and this character has been for years the best role of the wasted Eddy Murphy. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): \"Shrek para Sempre\" (\"Shrek Forever After\")",
    "Probably many people find the story confusing. I felt the same way when I saw it in the theater for the first time! The story seemed arbitrary and I couldn't connect the pieces together (much like I saw \"Ashes of Time\" for the first time). But when I watch it again on the DVD, I realize the movie is probably about one thing: personal freedom.<br/><br/>Howl is a free person. He doesn't has a heart and even his home (which is usually characterized as a stable point in one's life) can move :-) He is disguised as different wizards in different counties, and when Sophie asks him how many identities he has, he said \"Enough to guarantee my freedom\". When Sophie confronts Suliman, she comments Howl as \"selfish and cowardly and unpredictable, but he's straight as an arrow. He only wants to be free.\" But in Miyazaki's world, nothing is black and white. According to Suliman, Howl's power is too great for a person without heart, and he will eventually becomes a monster (some political figures come to my mind).<br/><br/>Sophie, on the other hand, is bounded by responsibilities. She is young, but her heart is old. She refuses the invitation from her friends and keep working at the hat shop. When her sister asks her \"Are you going to spend your life in that shop?\" She replies \"It meant so much to papa. Besides, I'm the eldest.\". Even her sister asks her to \"look out for yourself\". When Sophie is turned to an old lady, it actually set her free because the good thing of being old is that one has \"so little to lose\" She becomes more adventurous and takes control of her life. She is very assertive as being the cleaning lady in Howl's castle and even tames Calcifer to cook her food. For Howl, his turning point comes when he refuses to move his castle anymore (I'll leave it to the reader as why he does that) By the end of movie, he regains his heart. He feels terrible because it is like \"trapped under a stone\". And Sophie says, \"Yes, a heart is a heavy burden\".<br/><br/>There are other wonderful things in the movie. For example, this is probably one of the few movies that tell me what it is really like to be old. But I do want to highlight the thread about personal freedom as it will help you to tie up the pieces of the story.<br/><br/>Since there are 1000 words limit in the comment system, I'll write more in by blog: http://web.mac.com/kenlaw/iWeb/Site/Blog/Blog.html",
    "I saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and was simply delighted.<br/><br/>I saw a review that said something to the effect that the reviewer thought this would be just another teen movie, but then found it was based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night ... and then started trying to justify liking this flick on Shakespearean grounds. I really think this is going way overboard: the only connections I could see with Twelfth Night are (a) the basic conceit of a girl masquerading as a man; (b) the extensive male-female humor arising out of that basic conceit; and (c) some of the names (including Viola & Duke).<br/><br/>Aside from those names, the thematic commonalties (a & b) are really great themes for any script, and this movie's script is no exception. Beyond that, though, this really is a simply delightful and very contemporary/traditional teen flick. And that's a perfectly legit genre even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it ... like alluding to Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The movie is bright, fast-paced, emotive, stylized, funny ... full of teen hormones and teen humor and male/female humor suitable for all ages. And that's really the best part IMHO: really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in roundly appealing over-the-top fun. Those stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but affectionately, with such a complexity of invention that I'm still a little bewildered ... but really don't feel at all disappointed in that regard, it's not that kind of a movie: things come at you fast and fun and you get a laugh and a groan and then move on to the next split-second happening.<br/><br/>Amanda Bynes really is just delightful as Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful Duke; David Cross does a wonderfully over the top Principal Gold. All of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target. Cinematography was excellent.<br/><br/>Wonderful entertainment from beginning to end ... check it out!",
    "Being a long time fan of the BJD books (three years and counting), I had nothing but high hopes for the movie version. I was lucky enough to get into a sneak preview last night, and I was not disappointed. The movie, like the book, has the most hilarious lines and moments, and each of the actors portrayed their characters so well you couldn't imagine anyone else in that part.  Renee Zellweger IS Bridget, there is just no arguing it. No other actress could have pulled off what Renee did in this movie. Hugh Grant makes for an excellent Daniel, who is completely two faced and has a smarmy sort of charm that makes you want him just as badly as Bridget does. Colin Firth is a superb Mark Darcy, but that was a given because the character was practically written with him in mind - as all avid BJD readers know, Mark Darcy's character is a play on the Mr. Darcy Firth portrayed in Pride and Prejudice.<br/><br/>Some of the more hardcore fans of the book may be disappointed with all the missing jokes and scenes, but to film the entire book would have left us with a 10 hour movie. The writers did an excellent job distilling the essence of the novel, and the finished product has all the charm and wit of the original. The audience, many of whom I'm sure have never read the book (and many of whom, surprisingly, were male), laughed nonstop throughout the film, and everyone seemed to enjoy it thoroughly. As for those of us who have read it, I do believe that this is one of those rare book-to-movie jobs that was really spot-on, and everything that was noticeably changed in the process only makes the movie better.  So go see it, it's hands-down one of the best movies of 2001 so far.",
    "\"Atonement\" is structurally comparable to a three-act play, with a brief epilogue. The three central characters are Briony, the younger daughter of the wealthy Tallis family, her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, Cecilia's childhood friend. Robbie is from a humble social background (his mother is one of the family's servants), but academically brilliant, and Mr Tallis has paid for him to be educated through grammar school and Cambridge, where he has obtained a First. A brilliant future seemingly awaits him, in whatever profession he chooses, and he wants to pursue a career in medicine. <br/><br/>Act I begins like an upper-class comedy of manners. The setting is the Tallis family's stately home, on a hot summer's day in 1935. Briony, a precocious thirteen-year-old with ambitions to be a writer, has written a play to be performed by herself and her three cousins, but this project proves abortive due to disagreements between them. Robbie has fallen in love with Cecilia and accidentally sends her a sexually explicit love-letter. In other circumstances this might have resulted in disgrace, but as Cecilia returns his passion the accident seems to have been a happy one. The tone of the film changes abruptly, however, when Briony's cousin Lola is sexually assaulted. Lola cannot identify her assailant, but Briony, who was a witness, falsely accuses Robbie. As a result, he is convicted of attempted rape and sent to prison. <br/><br/>In Act II, set in 1940, Robbie, released from jail, is now a soldier with the British Army in France. He is desperately trying to reach Dunkirk ahead of the advancing Germans, kept going not by fighting spirit or patriotism, but by the hope of returning to Cecilia, who has stood by him throughout his trial and imprisonment, becoming estranged from her family as a result. In Act III we see Briony, now eighteen, as a volunteer nurse in a London hospital. It is in this Act that the theme of atonement comes to the fore. Briony is starting to have doubts about her identification of Robbie as Lola's attacker, so much so that she offers to withdraw her previous testimony and help him clear his name. Her decision to work as a nurse rather than go to university and to devote herself to caring for the wounded can also be seen as an attempt to atone for the part she played in blighting the life of an innocent man and in tearing her family apart.<br/><br/>After \"The Last King of Scotland\" and \"Becoming Jane\", James McEvoy is the rising male star of the British cinema, and his performance here is the best yet that I have seen. Whereas Dr Garrigan in \"The Last King\" was morally flawed, and Lefroy in \"Becoming Jane\" hid his better nature beneath a roguish exterior, Robbie is unambiguously heroic. McEvoy succeeds in conveying his character's basic decency, achieving the difficult task of making him good without making him seem dull. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley is another rising British star, and this is her second film with director Joe Wright after \"Pride and Prejudice\". Although she was good in the comedy \"Bend it like Beckham\", I think that her films with Wright are her best, suggesting that her future lies with serious drama rather than popcorn epics like \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" in which she seemed miscast. Her Cecilia was not only the loveliest, but also the liveliest and most spirited heroine of any film I have seen recently. Special mentions must also go to Saoirse Ronan as the young Briony and to Vanessa Redgrave who plays the now-elderly Briony in the epilogue, set in 1999. I felt, however, that Romola Garai, at 25, was too old as the eighteen-year-old Briony. <br/><br/>This was only Wright's second feature film, and he has already established himself as an accomplished director. \"Pride and Prejudice\" is a good film, but \"Atonement\" is better. Ian McEwan's book is among the best novels of recent years, and I doubt if any cinematic treatment could capture all its nuances. One of its themes in particular, the debate between literary traditionalism and modernism, seems beyond the scope of any visual medium, and Wright and the scriptwriter Christopher Hampton wisely steer clear of it. Hampton, who has turned the book into a very good screenplay, keeps McEwan's final twist, although it is here presented in a different way, with Briony revealing the truth in an TV interview. <br/><br/>If, however, the film does not capture all the literary nuances of the novel, Wright makes up for this with his extraordinary visual imagination, something sometimes lacking in films based upon novels. \"Atonement\" joins that list of films (\"Far from Heaven\" and \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" are other examples that come to mind) where almost every scene seems composed like a painting. This is true not only of Act I, set in that beautiful stately home (actually Stokesay Court in Shropshire), but also of Act II, where Wright can find a terrible beauty even in war, especially in the scenes of the burning town and that long shot of the Dunkirk beaches in the grey morning light. Particularly moving was the scene where the British soldiers sing \"Dear Lord and Father of Mankind\". The second line of John Greenleaf Whittier's hymn is, of course, \"Forgive Our Foolish Ways\"- a particularly apt comment on war, and perhaps on the behaviour of some of the characters.<br/><br/>Also very good was Dario Marianelli's musical score, which (appropriately for a film in which writing plays an important part) incorporated the sound of typewriter keys tapping. Altogether an excellent film- I can only hope that its British origins and late summer (traditionally blockbuster season) release date will not prejudice the Academy against it when it comes to next year's Oscars. 9/10",
    "I guess I'll have to put this one under my guilty pleasures department. I've always been a sucker for dinosaurs, and with the filming technology available today, a film like this one and it's predecessor have just the right ingredients for a fun time. Granted, there are many elements in the story here that don't make a whole lot of sense, but there's that old saying about suspending disbelief, so that's what I'm applying here.<br/><br/>Besides all the puzzling plot elements, and you know what most of them are, here's one I picked up in an early scene. When Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) looks at the wall map showing 'Las Cinco Muertes', The Five Deaths, the island of Isla Sorna is at the center of that cluster. In the opening screen narrative it's stated that this island is eighty seven miles southwest of Isla Nublar, but none of the other islands on the map go by that name. So a bit of a continuity slip-up there.<br/><br/>You know what I got a kick out of? At one point, one of the principal characters upon arriving on the island, states that the Eisenberg Uncertainty Principle is in effect, that is, it's not possible to study something without changing it. That was oddly reminiscent of the original Star Trek Prime Directive; an interesting concept but virtually impossible to maintain, because once you're there, your actions have consequences.<br/><br/>Say, and how about that Roland (Pete Postlethwaite), is he a Nascar contender or what? Recall when the InGen team first arrive on Isla Sorna and he's driving on the jungle trails with Ludlow (Arliss Howard). I had to rewind the scene because he had his head turned completely around to Ludlow in the back seat for a full forty seconds at one point - how did he do that? <br/><br/>Well anyway, not a lot of credibility to the picture, but how can you not marvel at the imaginative CGI work creating those magnificent dinosaurs? Stego's, T-Rex's and all those mini-predators make for a couple hours of dino fun. You don't even have to pay attention to the scientists.",
    "Similar to the first Ice Age, the promotional material for the sequel was out in the theatres way in advance, and courtesy of the Scrat character too, up to its usual antics of getting to that elusive acorn. Here, Scrat opens the movie, and emulating the style of the first, he provides most of the laughs, also as an intermission from the actual scenes from the main cast.<br/><br/>Our gang of prehistoric animals are back - Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabre-tooth Tiger (Denis Leary). We learn that Sid has gone into the early childhood business, educating the young minds of pre-historic brats. However, I felt that this movie was somehow darker in tone than the original. While the original was one which dealt with hope, this one had its setting in extinction, disaster and death.<br/><br/>The valley which they live in is threatened by the melting ice, no thanks to global warming. So all the animals embark on a journey to salvation, to that rumored ark which will save them from the massive floods to come. Along the way, our trio meets up with another trio of characters, who were added to expand the cast, featuring 2 Possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), and another, but female, mammoth (Queen Latifah).<br/><br/>Needless to say, Manny's still anti-social, and Diego can't get along with those rascal possums who get on his nerves, and Sid's the \"philosopher\" ever providing the laughs. Various themes like romance (hey, we got 2 mammoths here), friendship, trust, and believing in oneself to overcome one's phobia get covered. Pretty wide scope, but they manage to fit in place nicely.<br/><br/>The villains in this sequel are pretty nasty, besides the looming natural disaster, we have two sea creatures with nasty teeth and attitude, as well as menacing vultures ever ready to pounce on the flesh of animals who have fallen.<br/><br/>But it's not all that bleak. Keep a lookout too for that mad sloth song-and-dance sequence, which has potential to become the next ear worm ala Madagascar's zany \"you-got-to-move-it\" song. The animation is as usual, top notch, and I just can't get enough of the photo-realistic ice and water landscape.<br/><br/>This is one piece of animation that doesn't rely too much on sight gags, of spoofing current affairs, but one filled with more witty dialogue and kept on an even keel with its interesting storyline. Though at times it might feel clichéd, somehow it excelled in its execution.<br/><br/>And that makes this sequel, as enjoyable as, if not better, than the original. Recommended stuff this week!",
    "After hearing people praise this movie, and seeing how much it was advertised, I was curious to see this. Now, I've never loved Illumination's movies, but I've never hated them either. I don't mind any of their films, but I feel like they're not as innovative as certain other animation companies. Hearing how much people loved Secret Life of Pets gave me a bit of hope that perhaps this movie would be Illumination's breakthrough. The one that would have the best animation, story, characters, emotions, etc.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Secret Life of Pets just ended up being another okay movie for me. Right when I saw the trailers, I was reminded of Toy Story with the plot. I feared that the plot would be predictable, and it definitely was. A few different things were thrown in, but as a whole, the story was pretty predictable. One of the different things that was thrown in had potential to be a really emotional scene. This is a spoiler, by the way. Anyway, Duke finds out that his original owner had died, which could've led into an emotional scene, like in Finding Dory when Dory was made to believe her parents were dead. But the whole scene failed. Firstly, it was told, not shown. A random cat just gives the news to Duke. Second, Duke barely reacts to this, despite the movie going out of its way to show us a montage of him with his owner. He just gets mad at the family that moved into the owner's home before getting caught by animal control. After that, it's never mentioned again. Duke is just fine with his owner being dead, and living with a new owner and Max. This really bothers me, since as I said, this scene had potential to be emotionally provoking. But it didn't take the chance.<br/><br/>Our main characters didn't interest me. Max is just another typical good guy that just wants a good life. Duke was just another lovable big guy who may be a bit slow. However, the only characters that made me laugh/I enjoyed were Gidget, Snowball, Tiberius, and Pops. Gidget and Snowball were the ones that really shined, though. Gidget was just plain adorable, and hilarious. As for Snowball, I'm not a big fan of Kevin Hart, but he really did a great job for his first animated film. I personally prefer him doing voice work than him in live action films. He managed to make me laugh multiple times as Snowball. That bunny may be cute, but he's totally psychotic. As for the rest of the characters, they didn't really interest me. I don't hate any of them, but they were pretty generic.<br/><br/>I also am sick of the Minions. They got old when their own movie was made. I won't mind seeing them in Despicable Me 3, since we'll only get small doses of them, but having them constantly shoved in our faces is getting annoying. The short that came on before Secret Life of Pets was just stupid. No experimentation with the animation or characters. Just plain stupidity. They also had one of the dogs in Secret Life wear a Minions costume, and I just rolled my eyes. Minions may make Illumination money, but not many people care about them anymore. I certainly don't.<br/><br/>I do have some positive things to say about this film. The animation was impressive. I was particularly impressed with how they animated water, and the mannerisms of the pets. Which leads into the next thing I liked about this. I admire how much the creators of the film did their research on not just dogs, but most pets people keep. They were spot on with how dogs, cats, birds, etc. act. As a dog and cat owner, I appreciate the humor/realism that went into the pets, and they reminded me of my own pets.<br/><br/>As a whole, this a cute, but flawed film. I wasn't impressed with most of the characters. The story was predictable. Nothing about this film was thought or emotionally provoking. However, I appreciated some of the film's humor, animation, and the research that went into the mannerisms of the pets. It's a shame that this wasn't Illumination's breakthrough. Sure, it's making a lot of money, but it's still just an alright movie. Hopefully one day, Illumination will make a film just as great as the likes of Zootopia or Inside Out. The Secret Life of Pets just isn't that film.",

    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "Shattered. Yes, that's exactly how I felt. Unable to utter a word. Jonathan Banks creates one of the most hateful creatures I've ever seen on the screen and I've seen hateful creatures. I had a physical reaction to his recognizable monster, we saw him or one of his ilk marching down the streets of Charlottesville in 2017. Carey Mulligan is simply sublime. Garret Hedlund and Jason Mitchell have become two of my favorite actors. Their truth made of confusion, outrage and pain is pungently present in their eyes. Mary J Blige provides a powerful poster child for dignity and composure. A remarkable performance and Rob Morgan moved me so very deeply. A film experience that we all should confront. My gratitude and admiration to the extraordinary Dee Rees.",
    "The film that bested Star Wars for the 1977 Best Picture Oscar, Annie Hall is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking that transcends its simple, romantic premise to create a stunning portrait of not only 70's pop culture, but of human nature cumulative.  Directed and co-written by Woody Allen, who has since directed other gems such as Hannah and Her Sisters and The Purple Rose of Cairo, Annie Hall also stars Allen as Alvy Singer, a neurotic, death-obsessed comedian who seems unlucky in love and life.  That is until he meets Annie, brilliantly played by Diane Keaton, who is beautiful, fashion-savvy, carefree (she likes using expressions like `la di da'), and a terrible driver.<br/><br/>Annie and Alvy's relationship is an unlikely one.  She's a Midwestern girl, straight out of white-bread Wisconsin; he's a life-long New York Jew who grew up (literally) under the Coney Island roller coaster.  He's been seeing a therapist for the past 16 years; she only `needs' one once she meets him. She's an extroverted aspiring singer; he's an introverted, world-despising imp.  Yet Allen and Keaton are so perfect in their roles, they improbably make this couple one of the most memorable ever.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Alvy's chronicles of loves lost and a retrospective on his relationship with Annie, with whom he has since parted ways.  At the end of the film, we see Alvy try his hand at stage-writing-he writes a play about his relationship with Annie, but gives it a happy ending.  Yes, Annie and Alvy don't have a fairy tale ending to their relationship, but Alvy certainly wishes they had, even though he learns to live with the acknowledgment it has failed.<br/><br/>The best part of Annie Hall is its incredible screenplay-the best ever to be written.  Not a word is wasted nor a line unquotable.  Except here, while Allen's early films had thrived on streams of one-liners, Allen doesn't go for cheap laughs-each line is simultaneously hilarious and poignant. Everything is part of a greater whole.  We laugh because it's funny, but there's a greater dynamic at work in Annie Hall.  This is a story not exclusively about a relationship between two people, but also a musing on 70's politics, drugs, East Coast/West Coast rivalry, narcissism, religion, celebrity, and several other topics with which Allen deals with extraordinary ease.<br/><br/>Yet Annie Hall would not be among my favorite films of all-time if it were just Woody Allen ranting and raving about what he likes and dislikes. There are other Allen films that serve that purpose, i.e. Deconstructing Harry, and they're not nearly as good.  What separates Annie Hall is its grace, the believable chemistry between Keaton and Allen, the unique direction (ranging from split-screens to cartoon imagery to on-screen subtitles of what the actors are thinking), but mostly because it's the rare film to find a perfect balance between sheer entertainment, humor, and poignancy.<br/><br/>\nWhen the dust had settled, Diane Keaton deservedly won an Academy Award for her performance, Allen took home Oscars for direction and writing, and the film beat out Star Wars for Best Picture, which most people consider a complete sham.  Evidently, those people didn't see Annie Hall, for if they had, they'd recognize that the acting, writing, and even the direction in Star Wars can't hold a candle to Annie Hall, one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>10/10",
    "A really good movie and not a bad action movie I really like it, the whole gang is here. Fast Five (2011) is still to me the best one and my favorite in the franchise and then it would be Furious 6 than The Fast and the Furious I think this would be my fourth favorite film in the franchise. It is an entertaining fun fast paced action film and that really a good one. But it is not perfect I have issues with the film which I will get to it but first I want to write goods about this film.I can't wait till I watch The Fate of the Furious I am getting on Blu-ray next week so yesterday I re-watch this film and I have enjoy it. <br/><br/>Furious 7 is the seventh installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the sixth highest-grossing opening of all time. The film has grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide – more than the franchise's first five installments combined – making it the highest-grossing film of the franchise after just twelve days, the third highest-grossing film of 2015 and the sixth highest-grossing film of all time. A sequel, The Fate of the Furious, was released on April 14, 2017.<br/><br/>The film's about Dominic Toretto (Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), until Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother, puts the team in danger once again. <br/><br/>The cast includes: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell, and Jason Statham. <br/><br/>I like this flick they action is crazier than ever, there's some unnecessary camera moves and this one needs an even bigger suspension of disbelief, it barely pauses in between set pieces. Kurt Russell is in this and like I have said in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 my review I hated his performance in that movie but in here I loved him he was awesome and a really good guy and likable. He has more to do in this film than he did in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto is always terrific and a bad-ass I absolutely love him. Jason Statham is a crazy motherf***** in this I have enjoyed him I always wanted Statham as a bad guy. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz Dom's girlfriend was hot as always I have simply enjoyed her. The rest of the cast was alright.<br/><br/>The issues with the film I have is: Why is shaky cam in the beginning of the fights between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham and on the end of the fights between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham that really hurts this film. I got a migraine because of the shaking cam.<br/><br/>Dwayne Johnson was only in the beginning of the film and for the rest of the film he was departure he appeared only on the end of the film in the final showdown I only wish he would be more in this film and he would have more to do but I still have enjoyed his performance awesome. <br/><br/>Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto is useless in this movie she doesn't do nothing her character is just wasted and useless. I don't know why they put her character in this movie. Lucky Michelle Rodriguez fulfill the emptiness in Dom's crew. <br/><br/>Car's with flying parachutes also doesn't fit in the film because of the metal weight parachutes can't hold that kind of metal and some unnecessary CGI was used in this film that also hurt the movie. <br/><br/>Those are all the issues I have, I can't wait for The Fate of the Furious to see it I heard it is a good film.<br/><br/>The rating this film get's is a A 9/10 I would have give it 10 but those issues in my opinion hurt the film. <br/><br/>Paul Walker died in November 30 2013 so his two brothers Caleb and Cody Walker replaced him and they help to make this film right so I have enjoy from all three brothers performance. R.I.P. Paul Walker my favorite actor and my all time favorite character of the franchise Brian O'Conner. This film is dedicated to his memory which I love. <br/><br/>Furious 7 (alternatively known as Fast & Furious 7 and Fast 7) is a 2015 American action film directed by James Wan and written by Chris Morgan.

    "In bringing together elements from Inglourious Basterds, Ocean's Eleven and Museum Hours, George Clooney certainly had plenty of opportunity for a rich and interesting story. War heroes who appreciate fine art played by the likes of Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray and John Goodman (plus a few \"that guy\"s), attempting to steal back priceless works of art from the Nazis, it sounds amazing.<br/><br/>So what went wrong? Well, to begin with, for a movie about a team, we're given very little time with them as a group. Almost immediately they pair off on their own little adventures. Instead of using these exploits to let us know a little more about the characters as individuals, we get the usual oddball pairings and some mildly amusing, but ultimately hollow, vignettes. Even when we lose some of our team, it really feels like nothing more than just something that happened on the trip, like \"oh, and I also saw a horse.\" We have hardly any sense of them as a group and far less about them as people. The only character whose motivations we can understand is the one played by Cate Blanchett, but her limited chemistry with Matt Damon dooms what little redemptive quality her character had.<br/><br/>Also, and particularly troubling for a movie involving art, George Clooney's lens has little reverence for the work it shows. Though the film heavy-handedly ponders whether a piece of art is worth a human life, the camera never does. Even when a character lays down his life for a sculpture, it comes off less dramatic than inevitable. The film treats the works as being mostly historically significant and never finds that lover's gaze that tells the audience why.<br/><br/>What we're left with is a bag of spare parts. It's a popcorn movie with no setpieces. A war movie with no battles. A heist movie with no scheming. An art movie with no inspiration. Were they to have found some of Inglourious Basterds' bluster, Ocean's Eleven smarts or Museum Hour's insight, they may have found a formula that works, but that's not the movie we have here. I'll be damned if George Clooney doesn't look good in a moustache, though.",
    "I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. <br/><br/>All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards. Still, the plusses (John Toll's magnificent cinematography, Stephen Warbeck's great score, etc) I felt did not outweigh my initial negatives (Cage's miscasting, a heavily diluted script).<br/><br/>But, two days later, I was queuing again to see Corelli, and although not perfect, I have to admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected. Cage is actually brilliant in a role that even de Berniere was concerned was not a fully rounded character: his carefree spirit which gives way to shattered remorse is spot on, and complements the superb double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt perfectly. David Morrissey is quietly effective as Weber, the Nazi officer trying to reconcile his feelings for his newfound Italian friends and his inbred superiority complex to those around him. And the fine Greco-Italian supporting cast bring de Berniere's sundrenched world of Cepholonia dazzlingly alive.<br/><br/>On leaving the cinema second time around, I finally let go my passion for the novel which prevented me from fully appreciating the story of WW2 Cepholonia in cinematic terms. My hat goes off to John Madden who, despite the almost expected critical drubbing he is receiving from the British critics (any director who has had a major success like Shakespeare in Love behind them is always a target for these moaning ninnies!),has managed to transfer a terrifically difficult book to the big screen with such heart, verve and humanity (the core virtues of the novel, in fact) that he has created another classic love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has settled a few years from now.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the book, like me, it's hard, but try not to make the same mistake on your initial viewing. Try to erase the book from your mind for two hours, bathe yourself in the glorious Mediterranean atmosphere, and discover Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, Dr Iannis, as if for the first time (pretend you're watching something made from an original screenplay), and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>In fact, you'll be eagerly waiting to own your own copy of this delightful movie on video or DVD.<br/><br/>8/10",
    "'The Godfather' is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in America', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's \"threshold\". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a feared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a respected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse's head), 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made.",
    "THE IMPOSSIBLE (2012) <br/><br/>The 2004 tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters on record. Because it occurred in the Christmas season and hit many resort area beaches its death toll of almost 250,000 was indiscriminate, taking not only South Asians but many visiting vacationers. People everywhere were affected by it. My own relatives who were then living in Thailand were destined that day to be on the beach, but, unknown to the rest of us, illness caused them to alter their plans. I personally heard from Thai acquaintances the story of nieces and nephews who excitedly ran to the shore to see the wondrous phenomenon of the receding ocean, only to be swamped by its return. Weeks later, flying over the Indonesian coastline, I could see with my own eyes just how far inland the wave had rushed, and the devastation it had wrought.<br/><br/>How do you frame such a catastrophe in human terms, and present a situation of pure chaos in a way that makes a compelling story? How do you tell such a tale in a way that respects both the lost and the survivors, many of whom suffered personal tragedies as well, and more of whom bore the guilt of survival? How does one story tell some of the many stories of that day? These were among the challenges that faced director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez when they decided to put an account of the 2004 tsunami on the screen. Their solution was to deal with one British family on vacation in Thailand from Japan, but their film uses that family as a catalyst to show the tsunami's awful effect not only on the tourist population but on the local people who suffered even more.<br/><br/>Both the film itself and the filmmakers have taken pains to say that this is a \"true story,\" and they have aimed for the greatest possible authenticity in the circumstances. They have based themselves on detailed interviews with the family members and with other survivors, some of whom actually appear in the film. (For example, those who tell their tales to Ewan McGregor at the bus station are almost all actual survivors.) While footage of the tsunami strike itself was shot in a water tank at Alicante on the Spanish coast, and a couple of days filming of interiors took place in Spanish studios, the remainder of this picture was shot on location in Thailand using the real places of the story, such as the Orchid Beach Hotel in Phang Nga, and the actual hospital where much of the action occurs.<br/><br/>The actual Thai locations and the many Thai actors keep the production values superb, and give this film an authenticity it would not otherwise have. So of course do the survivors who take part, whose emotions are sometimes all too real. Many video shots exist of the tsunami hitting the Asian beaches, but no one who was not there can have any real idea of what it must have been like to have been caught up by its waters. Bayona has chosen to focus not so much on the massive power of the tidal wave itself but on the sheer terror and disorientation it must have created for those submerged in it, and upon the human toll it took. But his scenes of its striking are horrific enough to give some sense of its magnitude, even on the screen. Nor does he pull his punches in some of the grisly scenes that follow. The impressive results that display both the striking wave and its terrible aftermath owe much to production designer Eugenio Caballero.<br/><br/>The big names here are Ewan MacGregor as Henry and Naomi Watts as Maria, his doctor wife, while Geraldine Chaplin has a cameo role as a lady who comforts one of their sons on a starlit night. MacGregor and Watts seem to suit their parts, but in a sense they are playing predictable roles. They become a couple literally torn apart, a father having to search among the debris for the remainder of his family and a mother who for much of the picture hovers close to death. The family's three sons are played by Tom Holland (Lucas), Samuel Joslin (Thomas) and Oaklee Pendergast (Simon). The two younger boys are cute as well as being effective, but that is not really a word that suits Tom Holland. The young British actor displays a surprising maturity and delivers a wonderfully measured performance, reminiscent of a younger Daniel Radcliffe. Despite the bigger names involved, it is his portrayal of Lucas that carries the picture since he is the hub around whom events revolve as the individual stories unfold. That is a lot to ask of a young actor, but Holland delivers.<br/><br/>No one story can ever do justice to the events of that day and the days that followed. Nor can a story set in just one location ever capture just how wide-ranging were the tsunami's effects. How can you tell the story of what happened almost simultaneously in Indonesia and India, Myanmar and Malaysia, and eventually affected even the African coast. Thankfully, Bayona doesn't try. He focuses on the few, hoping that through them audiences will better understand the tale of the many. For such a story, The Impossible is perhaps a more than fitting title, but the film works and gives a view that is both visually impressive and dramatically moving.<br/><br/>The Impossible premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2012. It will open in Spain on October 11, and go into general release in North America in the last week of December.<br/><br/>Ray Lahey",
    "In the midst of the many wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick, it is strange to note how rarely people mention \"Barry Lyndon\".<br/><br/>The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.<br/><br/>Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in \"Barry Lyndon\" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.<br/><br/>The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.<br/><br/>\"Barry Lyndon is\", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them! KimotoCat",
    "In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends because he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it was free, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.",
    "Burn After Reading is a weird movie. It takes everything that makes a good spy flick and turn it on its head. You can't help but incredulously laugh at what happens. This is all about oddballs.<br/><br/>The good. Excellent acting. Totally off the wall characters, actions and situations, yet completely logical. Story with twists within twists. Well paced scenario. Solid dialogs. Nice action.<br/><br/>The actors. George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, and John Malkovich play disturbingly crazy roles stuffed with delusion and heavily dosed with stupidity. While Richard Jenkins, David Rasche, and J.K. Simmons seem almost out of place as the standard bearers of reason.<br/><br/>The bad. Since it's so bizarre, it won't please everyone.<br/><br/>The ugly. Nothing.<br/><br/>The result. Offbeat and cooky comedy. Don't think you'll see your run of the mill kind of film and you'll have fun.",
    "... in that you can argue about almost every stroke in the painting, yet when you stand back a few feet from the work, you realize that this is a more accurate portrayal of Steve Jobs than any photograph could be.<br/><br/>For example, Michael Fassbender looks nothing like Steve Jobs did at any point in his adult life, sounds nothing like Steve Jobs did. Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.<br/><br/>Kate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.<br/><br/>As for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.<br/><br/>So don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended.",
    "Is this a huge stepup from the original \"Thor\" movie. No, unfortunately not. Is it another watchable, fun superhero movie; yes, definitely. It's a really good movie and if we look at the way Alan Taylor directs this movie, it's actually not that much different from what Branagh did back in 2011. Chris Hemsworth is good as usual and Tom Hiddleston is more wonderful than ever as Loki, but the villain Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, unfortunately, is a bit of a disappointment, mostly because of the lack of motivation.",
    "This film is the equivalent to a sixteen year old, fairly privileged middle class boy, who has a baseball cap, curtains and t-shirt with the marijuana leaf on it yet has only ever smoked one spliff and made a huge deal about it. He thinks that smoking weed makes him relevant. So he needs to let everyone know he does it because there's nothing else that will appeal about him. Because he doesn't want to come off as a nerd, he lowers his intelligence and because he is too 'dumb' to actually be funny, he swears every 10 seconds to constitute humour. Possibly still faps over that one single poster of a tanned girl in a bikini that his Uncle bought him on his birthday because he was 'becoming a man, bro.'<br/><br/>It was described to my boyfriend as 'offensive'. It wasn't. It's vulgar. It's not even the funny kind.<br/><br/>I watched it last night with my boyfriend. Only us and a group of three 'lads' were in the cinema. Understand, we all laughed more during the adverts and trailers than we did the actual movie.<br/><br/>Within the first five minutes, I was embarrassed that I subjected my boyfriend and I to this and knew it was going to disappoint me.<br/><br/>Immediately, you're met with profanity. Now, once or twice to give the impression that hot dogs swear is fine. Swearing so much to substitute for lack of humour is just pathetic. Amidst the language, nothing funny was said. That's bad writing.<br/><br/>There's the joke that hot dogs are having sex with buns when they're put into the buns. That makes sense as a joke. It's a safe bet. This would have been modestly funny had it not been repeated throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Yes, we get it. The sausage is a phallic shape and goes into a bun.<br/><br/>It really puts it to you within the first few minutes. A pack of sausages shaming each other about their size and shape. (BECAUSE THEY ARE METAPHORICAL PENISES DON'T YOU KNOW! HAR HAR!) Again though, not funny or clever. Then courting the lady-buns by being vulgar. Sausage calls bun a b***h.<br/><br/>It was clear that I'd sat us down for an uninspired and lazy flop.<br/><br/>I laughed modestly twice. I laughed out of obligation and embarrassment about 5 times.<br/><br/>There were a few clever bits. I am a fan of wordplay, so to see someone riding a bottle of 'Horseradish Sauce' was satisfying. The Frankfurters were played as Nazis who hated 'Juice' and their symbol was 'ff', made to look the Nazi alternative. Offensive, yes, but a little clever. I like offensive humour.<br/><br/>There were so many opportunities for actual humour it hurts. Nothing that could have been funny was displayed for more than a second.<br/><br/>There was a graphic rape scene.<br/><br/>I get that it sounds ridiculous when you hear that it's a douche forcefully sucking the juice out of a carton.<br/><br/>You might think I am being silly, but I swear to you, if it had been humans, it would have been pretty horrific.<br/><br/>Because it was a cartoon, you were expected to laugh at rape.<br/><br/>Ha ha. No. I don't think any of the viewers found that funny, even the 'laddish' blokes at the back didn't crack a humoured grin.<br/><br/>There's also this really awkward sex scene at the end where all the food engage. This is to really bring home the hot-dog/penis metaphor.<br/><br/>A taco has lesbian sex with a bread roll.<br/><br/>My fingers hurt from typing.<br/><br/>If you're 12 years old and completely new to sex, drugs and swearwords, you and your dude-bros will love this.<br/><br/>If you require a little more maturity and intelligence in your humour, AVOID. Otherwise you'll leave needing to take a shower and needing to withdraw from cinema.",
    "As a husband who has a wife battling for her life with recurrent ovarian cancer, this movie struck very close to home. We a both in our late 20's and I am facing the possibility of burying my wife far to young, so suffice to say we both went to the movie and had a hard time keeping the eyes dry. There is nothing worse then prospect or actuality of burying your lover and your friend. I know this movie got a lot of negative reviews but when you see your life mirrored on the big screen you can't help but be moved by her struggle to move on and his undying love for her. I see another reviewer said to keep the boyfriends/husbands home, these people obviously have not faced such tragic circumstances. Usually I'd be the first to tear apart a click flick, but this didn't feel as cliché as most and I liked how the ending wasn't as predictable as click flick movies usually are.",
    "Saw II follows on the heels of Saw, as another taught, tense thriller. The mark of a great thriller/shocker/horror movie is the number of twists and turns, and this is what identifies Saw II as one of the better members of its genre.<br/><br/>This is NOT a movie where people walk backwards into dark rooms. This is NOT a movie where people pull sheets off bodies. That's all too predictable for Saw II. In fact, there's virtually nowhere in this film, where you can say that you've got it figured out.<br/><br/>Few movies keep me on the edge of my seat. This was one of them. There was no one dozing off during this flick. And the number of folks who walked out to take/make cell phone calls was the lowest I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Like Saw, this sequel is more than a little bloody in some places, but that's to be understood. It was never promoted as a walk in the park. If you're in the mood for a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is worth a try.<br/><br/>And this movie left more than a few folks in the audience waiting for another sequel.",
    "There are many good things about The Machinist that are well deserving of praise. The very atmospheric nature of the film is supported very strongly by excellent performances all around. Christian Bale takes things to the extreme in his embodiment of his character. It is hard to take seeing him in his near-starvation body mass, which elevates the tension of this piece even further. The storyline leaves a little to be desired. While it creates its mood excellently, it does tend to plod along a little too much.<br/><br/>One thing that does stand out is how reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock this film plays. Almost everything about the film screams Hitchcock, from the editing of certain scenes (the driving sequences are very much in the style of Psycho) to the Bernard Herrmann-esquire score (lots of bass clarinet), the lack of fully-exploring/revealing some of the creepier points of the film (what is dripping from the fridge?), and the washed out, grainy photography. If you want to see what a film would look like if Hitchcock were alive to film it today, this is the closest thing you could probably come across. And if that was part of Brad Anderson's intention in directing this, I have to commend him on the execution because it is uncanny.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this film, but not to casual movie-goers. This is very much a movie-phile experience for those who appreciate character development and cinematography as much as plot points and a storyline that can be defined and followed from one action to the next. In that way it is closer to films like Magnolia or the Others, where the apex is the characters. If you are looking for a typical popcorn Hollywood thriller, this is not what you are looking for.",
    "I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. <br/><br/>I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone",
    "I feel this movie gets a lot more hate than it deserves. Sure it may not be as good as the second one, and let's face it it's hard to top T2. But that doesn't make this a bad film. I actually like how John Connor is portrayed in this. Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.<br/><br/>And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",
    "You will not so much as want to take a sip of wine after watching this mesmerizing film about the horrors of drug addiction.  I was not a fan of director Darren Aronofsky's debut film \"Pi,\" but with this movie he proves to be a filmmaker of unlimited vision and style.  Four characters in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn are all driven to despair due to their drug abuse, the saddest being Ellen Burstyn as a nice Jewish widow who unwittingly becomes addicted to prescription diet pills that help her lose weight but drag her into a world of hallucinations and paranoia.  Burstyn is superb. It is so refreshing to see such a great veteran like her in such a challenging leading role, one in which she goes through a hell worse than that in \"The Exorcist.\"<br/><br/>But this is a director's film if there ever was one.  Aronofsky knows how to tell a story in a way that is dazzling in its use of sound, editing, and cinematography.  The score by the Kronos Quartet and Clint Mansell is the most striking movie music I have heard in a very long time.<br/><br/>\"Requiem for a Dream\" is not a movie for everyone.  It is the essence of independent filmmaking, a daring, engrossing, artful film that stays with you long after you leave the theater.  Hollywood bubblegum this ain't.",
    "If I stay is a beautiful, moving film about a teenage girl and the life or death decision she must make. Mia is a teenage girl that has a wonderful, quirky family, a boyfriend who loves her to pieces, and a bright, ambitious future. But, all of that changes when she and her family are in a fatal car accident. While Mia's body is in a coma, her mind journeys back to all of her memories, triumphs, heart breaks and future. She has to make the decision on whether or not to fight and stay alive, or let go and leave this world. Will Mia stay? <br/><br/>I love this movie. It made me laugh, cry and it helped me to see all of the good in my own life that I should cherish, because you never know when it could all change. The cinematography is beautiful. Most of the film is filled with memories that Mia has and the way they are portrayed is very neat. The music is also beautiful. Mia is a cellist and a lot of the film focuses on her dreams of becoming a successful musician, so the film is filled with beautiful classical music. <br/><br/>My Favorite character is Mia played by Chloe Moretz. This film shows so many aspects of Mia's life, so it's easy to find something to relate to. She has a great passion for playing the cello and dedicates most of her life to it. She has difficulties relating to her parents and even her boyfriend since their musicals tastes are far more edgy than hers. She has to face her insane loss and she has to choose between many different things in life. There's something about her life that I think anyone can relate to, so she's a wonderful character. Chloe does a wonderful job portraying everything she's going through and she moved me to tears many times.<br/><br/>This film makes me think about my own family and everything I would do for them. It makes me think of my life and all the joys and sorrows I've faced. There was not a dry eye in the audience because this film provokes unique memories for every individual. I felt especially connected to Mia's family because I too have a younger brother and am very close with my parents, so I was very touched by Mia's situation. <br/><br/>I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 because of the intense emotions and mature content. Make sure you check out If I Stay in theaters August 22nd.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",
    "The best we should reasonably expect from a movie like `Blue Crush' is that we will be treated to some stunning footage of surfers riding the world's greatest waves (along Hawaii's Pipeline, natch) to personal fame and glory. We certainly get that in abundance - but what we have less right to expect, perhaps, is that the film will offer anything else of any real quality. After all, we've been to these kinds of movies before, harking all the way back to those halcyon Bleach Blanket Bingo days when Gidget, Moondoggie and the rest of those addle-brained, teeny-bopper cut-ups aspired to nothing higher than a life of eternal youth spent wallowing in the bleach-white sands of Santa Monica or Malibu.  In the case of `Blue Crush,' therefore, I am happy to report that the screenplay - by Lizzy Weiss (based on a magazine article by Susan Orlean) -provides just enough touches of realism to keep this new film both life-sized and interesting.  And the majority of the credit goes to the film's protagonist, Anne Marie Chadwick who, much to our surprise, engages our sympathies from first moment to last. <br/><br/>\nAnne Marie is no bubble-headed, bleached-blond bimbo with nothing on her mind but winning the big Pipeline competition.  Although that is, indeed, part of her life's plan, Anne Marie is, also, an intelligent, pragmatic young woman, fully aware of both her strengths and weaknesses and just trying the best she knows how to make her life work for her, the young sister in her charge and the two surf buddy girlfriends she lives and works with.  Anne Marie is also riddled with insecurities, as she struggles to overcome the fear instilled in her by a near-fatal accident in that very same spot a few years earlier.  Meanwhile, she and her pals work hard trying to eke out a living as maids at a posh hotel, earning just enough money to keep a roof over their heads and pay some of their bills so they will be free to head to the coast at the first sign of prime `Surf's Up' conditions.<br/><br/>\nThe acting in the film is really quite impressive.  As Anne Marie, Kate Bosworth lights up the screen with her subtly nuanced, poised and dignified performance.   She knows how to use understated facial expressions to convey the thoughts and feelings of the character she is portraying.   Equally compelling are Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake as her fun-loving buddies, Mika Boorem as her little sister, and Matthew Davis as the professional football quarterback who becomes her love interest.  Director John Stockwell, to his credit, manages to keep the majority of the scenes intimate in tone and realistic in nature, rarely allowing the narrative to wander into overwrought melodrama or teen-movie farce.  Even the obligatory fight scene is kept restrained and believable.<br/><br/>There are occasional weaknesses in the film  a gaggle of snooty football wives and groupies who snub Anne Marie for being too lower class for their tastes are the primary offenders  but, on the whole, `Blue Crush' turns out to be a much better film than its subject matter would ever lead us to expect.  That comes as a particularly pleasant and un-looked-for surprise here in the shank of the summer movie going season.",
    "I attended the Cast and Crew screening on Sunday, in Leicester Square, with high hopes for this film as it's without doubt the most exciting job I've had. This was my first feature experience, and working for Tim Burton was a hell of a way to start.<br/><br/>But, even as someone with a lot of time for his films, and a pre-existing bias, I couldn't really connect with this. The cast acquit themselves well, especially considering the noted difficulty in emoting to a tennis ball on a stick, but all their tics and quirks seem to be masking a void at the centre of what should be a free-floating, evocative trip. Sure, it's weird looking, but we've seen it before, and back then in films like Edward Scissorhands it had a sense of purpose. Now we're left exploring a CGI wonderland that seems to be without a great deal of wonder. The book revels in its bizarre environs, absurd dialogue and whimsical characters. This film grounds them, drains them of that mystery and leaves us with a colourful but forgettable retread. It seems intent on driving us to a narrative conclusion that few people will have had much stake in through its running time, simply because we're not giving much to care for.<br/><br/>With a source material so familiar, even to those whose knowledge is second hand references, there needs to be a degree of innovation (as in Svenkmejer's dark stop-motion version, or the co-opting of Terry Gilliam in to his \"Tideland\" narrative), or else a studious and inspired adaptation that completely returns to Lewis Carroll. What we end up with is a mid-point that fails to get to grips with what enchants people about the Alice story, and another chance to see a beautiful waif walk around twisted, quasi-Gothic landscapes to a score by Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>Not that this isn't an enjoyable experience in itself, and as seen in the vast Screen 1 at the Empire it is at times breathtakingly pretty. It's just inessential, and while it may be unfair to expect a classic from a favoured filmmaker every time out, when they tackle something with the pedigree and history of Alice In Wonderland you can't help but hope for something special. And that's the problem, that Tim Burton, while he is still making decent films, has been a long way off special for some time now.<br/><br/>6/10 (if they gave half stars it'd be 6.5), but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. It's possible that my grade is affected by high expectations and lost potential. If you have kids, I'm sure it'll be better than 90% of the dross that passes for family films now. At least there is some artistry involved, and while he might not be at his best I'll still always pay to see a Tim Burton film (although I got this one for free...)",
    "Cube is a movie that explores human nature and our instinctive urges for survival vs our humanitarianism. Not a new concept, I know, however this movie does it in style, with a plot so simple that it could only be the work of a conceptual genius. I don't intend to give too much away, as the power of the film lies in it's mystery, but I will say that this movie could almost be classified as disturbing, not due to its content, but rather the thoughts that it instills in the audience. I found myself rather shaken as I left the cinema, feeling as though I had been exposed to an ugly, hidden side of humanity and society. Don't get me wrong, this movie is definitely worth seeing, I would even be so bold as to say that it must be seen! I must admit that there are few movies I have seen that have had such a profound affect on me, and I don't think I am alone in my feelings.",
    "Hitchcock made at least 11 films about the ordinary man, wrongly accused, on the run (sometimes really running, sometimes not) to prove his innocence in a situation beyond his control, the first one being \"The 39 Steps\", which really made him popular in Great Britain. It really is his signature theme.<br/><br/>Others include \"Young and Innocent\", \"Saboteur\", \"Spellbound\", \"Stage Fright\", \"Strangers on a Train\", \"I Confess\", \"To Catch a Thief\", \"The Wrong Man\", \"North by Northwest\", and finally \"Frenzy\". \"Saboteur\" starts Robert Cummings as Barry Kane, a wartime aircraft plant worker during wartime accused of murdering his co-worker and best friend during an act of sabotage on the plant. He meets up with model Patricia Martin, played by actress Priscilla Lane, during his run from the law, and later, of course, the various Nazi/Fascist sympathizers along the way.<br/><br/>\"Saboteur\" is mainly like \"The 39 Steps\", even including similar plot devices such as handcuffs, the blonde who doesn't trust the main character in the beginning, a race across the country (in one case London to Scotland, and in the other California to New York), and meeting the \"colorful\" locals along the way. And so, just like \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\", I believe this is an American remake of one of Hitchcock's earlier works.<br/><br/>I think Robert Cummings was chosen because he comes across as a very ordinary American, sort of an \"everyman\" with whom the audience can identify. I like Priscilla Lane because her character is a more involved in the action than Madeline Carroll in \"The 39 Steps\" and Ruth Roman in \"Strangers on a Train\". As mentioned elsewhere, though, Otto Kruger steals the show as the villain. I also liked Vaughan Glaser's performance as the blind uncle; his lines are great. There are some funny touches all along the way for some comic relief, such as road signs featuring Priscilla Lane's character on them, and circus sideshow performers, and the truck driver, Murray Alper. Contrary to other opinions here, there aren't too many characters who believe Barry Kane's innocence immediately.<br/><br/>There are some slow parts, mainly when the action first moves to New York, but it picks up quickly when the last planned act of the fifth columnists gets underway.<br/><br/>It's one of my favorite films from Hitchcock (I put it in my top 5), especially in these days of the new war on terrorism. I think it hits home.<br/><br/>It makes you think, \"Could my coworker be involved in something evil?\" In fact, one of the movie posters for \"Saboteur\" proclaimed \"Watch Out for the Man behind your back!\" Imagine how that played in the mind of adults during the Second World War.",
    "The Ring usually gets a bad rep for being \"too slow\" and some people even say that \"nothing happens\" in the movie. Unless you have ADD or something, you have to at least appreciate what Gore Verbinski achieved in 2002. What he did was he basically took the premise of Ringu, a good suspenseful Japanese horror flick and made it more suspenseful and filled with creepy visuals.<br/><br/>I am a huge horror fan, and this is one of the movies that unsettles me the most. The suspenseful pace, the incredible, beautiful but haunting visuals make this a unique experience. I love gory films, but this one relies a lot more on psychological horror and imagery to create scares. No jump scares, just good story telling.<br/><br/>The movie may not answer all the questions it creates, but the viewer, if he pays attention accordingly, will be able to figure them out for himself. <br/><br/>Unsettling to the bone, The Ring is one of my favorite horror films of all time. Truly underrated.",
    "Being German I'm not really into the Hooligan way of life. I'm just fond of the Brit way of making films and this one is just brilliant. Of course you can argue about whether the director Nick Love is showing the life of some football thugs too positive and without the \"never do this, kids\" attitude, but...this is just a great piece of film. It has terrific acting (especially Frank Harper does a great job), splendid camera and editing and a more than suiting soundtrack. Watched it with some pals and it was just great fun. The scene where Rod tells his girlfriend's parents about his inner thoughts is a highlight. So if you're able to shut out all thoughts of moral and you're just interested in 90 minutes of quality film-making of today...watch this. It's definitely all worth it!",
    "Perhaps I'm a little biased. After all, this is set in the city I live and work in, and seeing Oxford Street and Piccadilly Circus, which I pass by every morning and which are usually teeming with crowds of people, completely empty was enough to send shivers down my spine. Usually when you watch a movie like this it's located in some nondescript Midwestern village, which makes it easy to detach yourself from the events unfolding on screen. But seeing them occur in the place you call home is something that gives it an entirely new sense of reality, and one I was previously unaccustomed to.<br/><br/>Still, judging 28 Days Later entirely on its merit as a film, it's easy to arrive at the conclusion that it's a fantastic achievement, as well as a coming-of-age of sorts for director Danny Boyle; I can't say the MTV-inspired vanity of The Beach, or the self-consciously trendy posturing of Trainspotting appealed to me, and to my shame I initially expected 28 Days Later to be given a similar treatment. Thankfully, my fears proved unfounded, discarded straight after a opening sequence which is at once effortless and fearsome. The rest of the movie was a joy. A terrifying joy, but a joy nonetheless.<br/><br/>It's true that sometimes minimalism can be more effective than overblown bravado, and it's definitely true for this movie. It's the scenes of complete silence which get to you the most; an entire metropolis empty. The grainy picture serves to add a documentary-style quality to the film, which makes the whole situation seem almost too real to bear. Definitely a wise choice to film this on digital video.<br/><br/>You will occasionally meet people who thought 28 Days Later wasn't 'scary' or 'gory' enough. These are the same people who will tell you that 2001 was 'boring', or that Memento was 'confusing'. Ignore them. Others didn't understand the purpose of the second half, or were confused by its change of pace, feeling that it distracted from the movie as a whole. However, I personally regard the second half as very important because, as another reviewer pointed out, it makes a very succinct point: What is scarier, the end of the world, or having the world repopulated by maniacs? That, I think, is where the real Horror of 28 Days Later lies.<br/><br/>28 Days Later, like the Romero zombie flicks of yore, is ultimately an allegory of the days we are living in, an age in which we are constantly confronted with violence by the media (much like the ape right at the start of the film), where violence begets violence, and humanity faces an uncertain future. I applaud Danny Boyle's bravery in making 28 Days Later because he undoubtedly took a big commercial risk when the majority of the cinema-going public might prefer escapism to words of caution. Remember, Rage is a human-made disease. Quite the allegory there.<br/><br/>Like most great masterpieces of their time, 28 Days Later has been misunderstood by a considerable amount of people. I have no doubt it will go down in history as a classic, the one movie which perfectly sums up the confused era we are living in. And even if you didn't like it, it would be advisable to give 28 Days Later another chance; it's a haunting experience when looked at from the right angle. Danny Boyle has many years left in him, I hope he'll continue making more movies like this.",
    "Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!",
    "After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions, ridiculous CG-assisted stunts and mindless action, I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better. <br/><br/>The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle. <br/><br/>De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots, but all are carefully tied into the through-line of the story to match the main character's progression. <br/><br/>The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story, The Bay of Pigs debacle, and traces the steps that lead to it, one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character, Edward Wilson, barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did (the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wire-rimmed or horn-rimmed glasses), but it didn't ruin the film for me. <br/><br/>Overall though, definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand, rather than forget.",

It was a hit!<br/><br/>George : Well here's an idea.Let's make a sequel!<br/><br/>Matt : Fantastic idea!

Steven Soderbergh's a friend of mine so he'll love directing us again.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, he'll do it. He won't have to work too hard though because it's got us in it.

    "Well I guess it's official, I'm eating my words as we speak. Yeah, I'm the guy who doesn't like sequels and yet here I am giving positive ratings to Star Trek Into Darkness and now The Hangover Part III. It's scary to think of what I might do next. If the new Fast and the Furious movie impresses me, I guess I'll just skip reviewing it and go straight into denial. But seriously folks, I went into the new Hangover with really low expectations. We're talking bottom feeder if you know what I mean. So from now on I think that's the key. I'm going to take this approach with every film I see. That way I'll stroll out of the theater as a movie critic that raves about everything and comes off as not so darn grumpy. Whoa, forget what I just said. I was merely kidding people!<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what occurs in part III. At the very beginning, we find mentally unstable \"wolfpack\" member Alan (Zach Galifianakis getting the most exposure he's had in any of the Hangover films) buying a giraffe, putting it in the back of his truck, and killing it on the freeway (I'm thinking you know how it happened). Upon doing this, he irritates his family and draws concern from the other \"wolfpack\" members (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha). Everyone but Alan, stages an intervention on his behalf to get him to a treatment center somewhere in Arizona. He'll agree to go if his three buds will drive him there. As the four of them set out on a moderately short road trip, their car is rammed off the road, they are dragged out of it (held at gunpoint mind you), and one of the crew (Bartha of course) is taken hostage. This sets off a chain of events which leads everybody to venture back to good old Sin City.<br/><br/>Well let's get down to it. Right off the bat I want to let you know why I liked The Hangover Part III. I enjoyed it for the exact reason that some critics panned it. This flick doesn't try to be like the other two in the trilogy. In fact, it feels like a totally different animal all together. Yes there is a dash of the funny (something part I did effortlessly and part II attempted miserably), but there's also a hint of darkness that comes close to turning everything into a sort of black comedy with shards of mild violence. For me, this is an effective way to wrap things up (unless there is a part IV of course). You can tell that the director (Todd Phillips) wanted to avoid copping out and injected part III with a little more juice (this is the other reason I liked it and most critics didn't. They think Phillips went way over the top or felt he had to prove something). He did the film justice by avoiding the same tired plot line (everyone gets smashed and wakes up not knowing what the heck just happened) while making an effort to tie together loose ends from the other two movies (by way of flashbacks). This is done to effect in the first 15 minutes and it sets everything in motion.<br/><br/>The actors then promptly assume their personalities from the first two installments. Doug Billings who's never around for the debauchery, plays the happily married nice guy. Alan, plays the screw loose, borderline mental patient who nonchalantly goes about his business. Phil, is the smug, unhappily married school teacher who is calm under pressure, and Stu is the manic anxiety ridden dentist who thinks all hope is gone. Together they fit their roles like comfortable old shoes. Overall their performances are manically unhinged. You get what's required of them coupled with a fresher more potently nasty script this time around (part II's had lazy written all over it).<br/><br/>As far as supporting work goes, I thought John Goodman (gangster Marshall) was a nice little addition to the Hangover family (he riffs off his Big Lebowski character but just not quite as intense). I also like the addition of a love interest for Alan (someone besides man crush Phil) in Melissa McCarthy. She seems to make a cameo in everything these days and certainly is a hoot as a pawn shop owner who candidly berates her wheelchair confined mother.<br/><br/>The only setback for this Hangover is the blatant deviation from the focus of the four stars of the movie (the infamous \"wolfpack\"). This exercise is bent on giving two supporting characters their own vehicle (Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Galifianakis). True these guys are funny and steal many a scene, but the other members of the cast don't get a lot of room to breathe. They get kind of pushed to the side and become sort of frowned upon (Bradley Cooper recently got nominated for an Oscar, give him some props for gosh sakes). And what's with always having Justin Bartha's character not present with the other members of the \"pack\" when the madness of their misadventures is going down. It seems predetermined and silly. What, is he not good enough an actor to occupy some precious screen time with his buddies (Bartha was in the colossal flop Gigli (2003) so maybe that's it, who knows).<br/><br/>When it all comes down to it, I found myself at ease with the way part III whisked by. It's darker than the first one, funnier than the second one, and more daring than both of them. I laughed, I winced, and felt confident in recommending this hot mess of a movie. It's a sequel all right, but it tries really hard not to be one. I admire that. With nothing to lose, you should go check out The Hangover part III. It's a solid time killer and a required \"hair of the dog\" if you will.",
    "Spoilers Ahead, DO NOT CONTINUE!!<br/><br/>Look, it's an interesting film that's an ok way to kill 2 hours. But the ending complete ruins the entire premise of the film.<br/><br/>The mother we believe to be the good mother is actually the \"evil\" version (who swapped identities in the beginning of the film unbeknownst to the audience).<br/><br/>1. The original premise - that the mother does not remember what happened in the mirror house, is perfectly logical. She has amnesia due to fear. However, the amnesia and fear does not hold up if the mother was the evil version all along. There should be no amnesia and the only reason for it is to deliberately trick the audience.<br/><br/>2. If the mom was the evil version all along, she shouldn't be scared of a \"shadow\" of herself as she claims. Sure she could be scared (of being revealed to be a fraud by the true her) but not of a shadow. Again, purposeful misleading to set up the twist.<br/><br/>3. Why does the good version go insane and deciude the only way to get revenge on her evil self is to raise an army of evil duplicates that murder their good halves? Again, contrived and makes no sense.<br/><br/>4. Why didn't/ couldn't the good version of the girl use the escalators to escape the evil realm? This really doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>5. How the hell did all of the evil versions have enough food/ water to survive?<br/><br/>6. Surely not every single copy of everyone in the world was stored in the one bunker shown. So how did the \"Good\" girl convince all of the evil copies (of all the rest of the world) to arise??<br/><br/>There are probably many many MANY more issues with this film. But god does it destroy itself trying way too hard to set up a profound twist that is just completely illogical.",
    "What an enviable list of voice-over stars. <br/><br/>What fun characters mouthing multi-language pseudo-meaninged gibberish (as opposed to just gibberish). <br/><br/>What a great start with a series of interesting minion history snippets (all of them already in the trailer - yes, those are the best bits and nothing else in the rest of the movie comes close).<br/><br/>What frustration when the gear just gets stuck - and the whole thing numbingly grinds into predictable land with uninteresting plot, an array of boring characters  blah blah  and ends up just another multimillion gibberish animation.<br/><br/>After the first 10 mins, Minions is plagued by too many unnecessary pointless characters, plain villains, inconsequential dialogue and actions  and the boredom (and depression) that the Minions experience on screen is unfortunately also paralleled at the same time by the audience and never really lifted up after that.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Allison Janney's character and voice was the most distinctive, but it was only a minor role. Sandra Bullock's villain Scarlett Overkill is way underdone, and the character visualization lacks any wickedly engaging factor, just boringly unlikeable. Jon Hamm's character adds nothing at all to the flimsy plot and his voice is too generic to matter as to who is doing it. All the other stars had inconsequential and indistinctive who-cares voice-overs.<br/><br/>The whole thing is so bland that the leery voice of Young Gru (Steve Carrell) right at movie's end was such a welcomed relief - at last (and alas it was the end) a little promise of inventive fun  but way too late.<br/><br/>Watch it, but don't expect too much and you'd probably be mildly entertained.",
    "Much as I admire Spike Lee's talent and audacity, this film just didn't work for me. Too many preposterous plot points while the motivations (of everyone, it seemed) were never clear. The whole thing was just confusing.<br/><br/>And yes, disjointed.",
    "The concept of Limitless is fantastic - what would happen if you could take a pill (NZT) that would allow you to use 100% of your brain (instead of the standard 20%) and function on a level higher than you have ever functioned before? The possibilities for such a movie idea are well, limitless - pun intended - but unfortunately, despite some great acting, especially by Bradley Cooper, who plays Eddie Morra - the lead whose life the movie follows throughout it's duration, the film just could not overcome some major plot holes, sloppy writing and nonsensical moments.<br/><br/>LOTS OF SPOILERS...<br/><br/>Many times throughout the film, the script uses PLOT driven storyline instead of CHARACTER driven storyline in order to go from Point A to Point B which the script called for & in the process, didn't make much sense given who the characters were in the picture. Some examples:<br/><br/>1) The movie needed for Eddie to find the NZT stash & money in his Brother in Law's apartment, steal it, get away with it and then take the pill, feel the effects, and use the money to regain his life. Problem? It's absolutely ridiculous to imply that the cops wouldn't have searched him or at the very least patted him down after calling in a murder & going down to the station for questioning. Of course, the huge wad of cash/pills he shoved down the back of his pants would have been found had they searched him so it didn't happen. It's illogical and absolutely ridiculous that he would be able to steal what he did from the apartment, an apartment that he locked himself in when the police initially arrived - and have no issues.<br/><br/>2) The movie needed for the Russian thug to come after Eddie in order to find the NZT, take it and then make trouble for him the entire movie. Problem? It's not believable that super smart Eddie wouldn't remember to pay back the 100k that he borrowed especially when the money was constantly on his mind and he had just made 2 million off of what he borrowed. This is clear cut plot driven over character driven storyline because it's ridiculous for Eddie, the character, to not remember such a basic task, especially when there was direct danger to his life if he forgot.<br/><br/>3) The movie needed for Atwood's lawyer to steal Eddie's stash of pills causing Eddie to spiral out. Problem? Isn't it far fetched to imply that Atwood's henchman killed the woman in the hotel to frame her murder on Eddie at the oft chance that Eddie would retain the same lawyer that worked for Atwood just so he could get close to him to steal his pills for Atwood to save Atwood's life? Huh? How did the henchman/lawyer even know that the pills would be on Eddie to take? They never used to be - the custom suit w/ hidden pocket was something new. He certainly didn't carry them on him back when the woman was initially killed. This whole setup was contrived and made no sense and was based on a lot of coincidences, ones that no one could have predicted.<br/><br/>That is just a few examples of sloppy storytelling. There are also a bunch of basic nit picks that I have like: 1) Why didn't Eddie, who was fearing for his life, buy a gun & train how to use it under the help of NZT? He hires bodyguards and buys a fortress to live in but doesn't purchase a handgun? 2) Why didn't the scientists who made NZT take it themselves in order to use their super smarts to perfect the drug and make it what Eddie's scientists were able to create in the end without the aid of being under the drug's influence? 3) After drinking the Russian's NZT laced blood, why did Eddie lie there on the ground waiting for the henchmen to return so he could poke one in the eye w/ a needle? Why not get out of there? Did we really need that stupid fight scene? 4)Breaking into the safe with a chainsaw in minutes? Impressive 5) Is it really believable that NZT wouldn't have hit the black market and been all over the place?<br/><br/>Lastly - a huge problem I had with Limitless was the happy, Hollywood, contrived Ending. Withdrawal from NZT? Side effects? Once the drug wears off so does the heightened brain activity? No problem - the movie flashes forward 12 months to give Eddie Morra a rainbows, puppies & sunshine like ending where his labs have now created a pill that works like NZT only there are no side effects and the super smart effects are permanent. How nice! He's all happy now & brilliant forever & running for Senate - he's with his girlfriend & their ordering food and look, he's fluent in a foreign language because he's so smart and YUCK. The ending was so over the top in an 'everything worked out in the end' way. I hated it. I didn't need for Eddie to die or crash and burn or anything like that but Limitless took the concept of a happy ending to another level.<br/><br/>Also, with the ending comes a rushed attempt to villanize De Niro's character of Carl Van Loon who out of no where makes a pathetic power play by trying to blackmail Eddie & is quickly shot down. The whole scene between them fell flat for me and felt incredibly sloppy and quickly put together.<br/><br/>Overall, in spite of all the shortcomings, Limitless is still a really good movie. It's thrilling, fast paced and the basic concept is interesting and makes for an entertaining film - you just can't really think about things like logic or else you will be disappointed. 7/10",
    "Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been \"asked\" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.<br/><br/>Perhaps these comments will not make sense to the average movie goer who will dismiss this film--and, unfortunately, its premise--as another hollywood flick filled with gratuitous violence. I'd go as far as to say that this film is not about violence. It is about choices. It is about activity. It is about lethargy. It is about waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we've gone to the toilet and thrown up our dreams without even realizing that society has stuck its fingers down our throat.<br/><br/>I would argue that anyone caught, at some point in their lives, between a rock and a hard place--anyone who has reached bottom on a mental level--anyone who has uttered to themselves \"Wait, this isn't right. I would not do/say/feel what it is that I just did/said/felt... I do not like this. I must change before I am forever stuck being the person that I am not.\" These people, they will know what I'm talking about. These people will not only recognize the similarities between Edward Norton's character and themselves--they will be uncomfortably familiar with him. These people will appreciate Fight Club for what it is: a wake up call that we are not alone.<br/><br/>As David Berman once said: \"I'm afraid I've got more in common with who I was than who I am becoming.\" If this sentence makes any sense to you, go see Fight Club. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>L.",
    "I have enjoyed most of the computer-animated films made so far, ranging from Pixar films like \"Toy Story\" and \"The Incredibles\" to DreamWorks films like \"Shrek.\" But \"Finding Nemo\" is the one that remains unparalleled, not because of its comedy or creativity, both of which are equaled in the \"Toy Story\" movies and in \"Monsters Inc.,\" but because it truly, more than any of the previous computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children's animated film.<br/><br/>Humor in traditional animation is usually based on broad slapstick and physical exaggeration. There are occasional nods to this brand of humor in \"Finding Nemo,\" as when a flock of seagulls ram into a boat and we see their beaks crowing on the other side of the sail. But such sequences only call attention to how far this movie generally departs from old cartoon conventions. Instead, the movie invests its world of sentient animals with a surprisingly scientific texture. All of the animals are based on real species. The fish tank is constructed out of real devices. There is a strong sense of locale, as Marlin (Albert Brooks) travels across the Pacific to Australia, where even the animals speak with an Australian accent. In a scene that I'm sure Gary Larson of \"Far Side\" fame loved, a pelican discusses with a group of fish the intricate details of dentistry. The fact that the animals talk and understand what's going on is treated as though it were a natural feature of the world. The realism is so striking that by the end of the film, you'll almost believe it possible for fish to plot an escape from a tank.<br/><br/>Far from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of the humor is based on parodies of human behavior: repentant sharks start a club that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns, and a four-year-old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive. The manner in which Marlin finds his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.<br/><br/>The story employs the same basic formula used in \"Toy Story,\" in which two characters, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they're forced to journey through a world populated by creatures that are a lot more knowing than the humans realize. This movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real human disorder is risky, to say the least, and I'm glad the filmmakers didn't lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only generates some of the film's biggest laughs, but reinforces the character interaction that is so central to the story. This is in fact the only Pixar film to feature true character development. In the course of his voyage, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the film's director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns to be self-reliant.<br/><br/>Of course, none of the sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans that Marlin encounters along the way really mean any harm. They're just doing what they do. As Nigel the Pelican tells Nemo at one point, \"Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.\" That's perhaps the film's most interesting insight, that there are no true villains, just creatures that act according to their nature, and a few that transcend it.",
    "Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.<br/><br/>The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous \"blondes\"), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.<br/><br/>\"To reveal more,\" as Leonard Maltin wrote, \"would be unthinkable.\"<br/><br/>While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!<br/><br/>One of the all-time greats. They definitely don't make them like this anymore.",
    "Some reviewers have suggested that the storyline of this movie is a bit plodding and portentous, and I'd be willing to allow that. But even if this film had absolutely no plot to speak of, I would have considered the money I plunked down yesterday to see \"Hero\" to be money well-spent, because I have been witness to some of the most achingly beautiful film-making I've ever seen. As in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" the characters here fly through the air and dance across water, but \"Crouching Tiger\" surely could have benefited from the sublime camera eye of \"Hero.\" One scene of swordplay in particular that takes place in a grove of trees amongst swirling yellow leaves almost stopped my heart in my chest: It was that gorgeous. And yes, there is a plot also, one that involves various assassins with names like Sky, and Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. I have to admit that the tales and counter-tales told were a bit confusing at first, but by the time the film is over, all the pieces have fallen into place, and this chapter of ancient Chinese history has assumed a truly mythical quality. At a time when movie theaters show a lot of utter dreck, we ought to be supporting movies like this.",
    "Don't look at the movie the way it is. You can hate it for whatever reasons you like but this movie isn't just stupid, soulless and pointless sexual fantasy. There is more thought put into it than you could ever imagine. Too bad critics panned the movie for the things that couldn't comprehend and the audience went with it.<br/><br/>The whole thing is a big fantasy that does not exist or happening in the real world. The movie is actually about Sweet Pea(Abbie Cornish). She is the star of the show. Snyder made that very clear from the start. Babydoll(Emily Browning) is a figment of Sweet Pea's imagination. She is the physical embodiment of Sweet Pea. She is the 5th thing. She is the guardian angel that Sweet Pea created to deal with her trash life. The entire film is a reflection of the internal struggle of Sweet Pea. That's why she is the one who's narrating the film. The stuff that we've seen with Babydoll during the first act, that's all Sweet Pea acting out her past trauma in her mind, just as she was taught to do in the mental institution. That's why the movie opens on a stage that direct parallel to how Sweet Pea is acting out that same trauma on a stage when Babydoll first arrives in the mental institution aka the theater. After that, the lobotomy comes, the key to everything that happens in the movie. Reimagined through Babydoll perspective, Sweet Pea disassociates from reality when the needle plunges into her brain, retreating into her mind in the same way she's taught to by Dr. Gorski. She's not in the real world anymore. This is also what happened in Sweet Pea's real life. And the effect of that lobotomy is the goddamned movie. Yes, this movie is the result of a lobotomy. Just one big subconscious coping mechanism for Sweet Pea to find peace. And this girl is able to interrupt the lobotomy, intruding on her own story. She's even able to repurpose the accidental killing of her sister into a deliberate and necessary sacrifice on her sister's part to save her. In this second layer of fantasy, Sweet Pea imagines herself and the rest of the girls working in a brothel, objectified and lusted after by an audience. This mirrors us tuning in to see these girls perform for us in various outfits. This connection is made clear from the opening of the film, which lets us know that we're the audience watching all this unfold on stage. By choosing to watch the movie, we are complicit in everything that's happening. Of course, this doesn't mean to condemn you for wanting to see nubile girls kicking ass. What this movie is really about is the difference between empowerment and exploitation. This is represented through three layers of fantasy, first was the mental institution, second is the brothel, third is the fantasy-action scenes, each exploring a different set of social values, each aligning with different phases of the feminist movement. First up is a grim incarnation of the '60s -the mental institution- set during the second wave of the feminist movement, when gender inequality was much more widespread. That gender inequality is amplified in the second world -the brothel- which takes us back even further, to a time when women were literally treated like property. And finally we have the pop culture world -the world of today, action scenes- which imagines Babydoll's dancing through various aspects of modern geek culture, dressing the girls up in all the typical fetishistic attire we've come to expect video games, TV, movies, etc... Sweet Pea is aware of how sick this is and rejects that Baby Doll's dancing could possibly be empowering. It's only through seeing its effect on men does she start to see how much power they really have, as the girls start taking back the control they've lost by using men's objectification of them to their advantage. By embracing their sexuality instead of fearing it, they learn that their inherent femininity can be better used as a means of holding men under their sway. Suddenly, it's the men who become helpless instead of them. Point being, men may be in a position to physically overpower women, but women have the power to psychologically overpower men, thus inverting history's long-standing power dynamic between men and women. This is then mirrored to very much the same effect in the action fantasy scenarios - a symbolic gesture on Snyder's part to show women taking back geek culture, which men have been dominating with their boy club mentality and pervasive misogyny for far too long. This is demonstrated further once we cut back to Babydoll's lobotomy after Sweet Pea has found peace. While Sweet Pea busy imagining that she's taking the magic school bus to a better world, Blue has plans of his own. But its no use, she's already escaped, even if it's only mentally. Sweet Pea sacrifices her body -Babydoll- and retreats into the comfort of her own mind, a paradise over which nobody has control of but her. Blue may have control over her body, but without her mind, he has nothing. The importance of this is also apparent during Babydoll's encounter with the High Roller, who recognizes that the choice to truly be with someone lies with you and you alone. As the scene with the High Roller reaffirms, the distinction between exploitation and empowerment all comes down to personal choice. And that is just half of the point this movie trying to make. Women deserve just as much control over their bodies as they have over their minds. You can interpret this movie so many ways, it's beyond belief. It gives you so many options to think. It's really funny that the one who made this kind of a movie and the one who is trying to defend it is a male. But it is what it is. If this movie made by someone like Stanley Kubrick, probably everyone would have tried to decipher the depth of it and wouldn't have even minded the bad reviews.<br/><br/>It's really sad that people turn off their brains and see everything literal, and never uses their brain to read the images that appear on the screen when they see a Snyder film.",
    "This film is an insult to Faith Sultan Mehmet, to Ottoman history, and to the intelligence of any audience. It is the very example of how western orientalizm can be internalized. The reason why the conquest of Constantinopolis was a matter of survival for the Turks -the economical, political reasons- were totally non existent. Mehmet II, a well educated man, is nothing more than a religious zealot in this film. Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, who is well respected by the Turks, is a caricature. <br/><br/>Suicide bombings, only a phenomenon of late 20th century, is a common theme in the film: all Ottoman soldiers behave like suicide bombers! What is this? What are they trying to imply? This is a part of the recent series of superficial films and TV shows which seem to aim de-educating Turkey, constantly attack reason, and play at Turkish people's feelings of being under attack of western contempt, orientalizm and memories of WWI defeat.<br/><br/>The side themes fail as hard as the main theme: an absurd love story, a wife with no dialogue, unexplainable motives of Urban, and so on... <br/><br/>This film is harshly criticized in Turkey. I can't imagine why it is being defended so eagerly on IMDb. Because it fails in stirring any feeling of satisfaction of national pride as well. No character study, no context, no wit, not even a propaganda, just the first depiction of the conquest with a relatively big production, a way to imagine how it was, and that's why people go to see this movie in masses. One can't deny the production of war scenes is an improvement for Turkish film industry, but unfortunately, that's all.",

    "Many people compare \"Once Upon a Time in America\" with \"The Godfather\". In my opinion these two movies can't be compared. Both are masterpieces in their own way, but each of them has a different style. You don't compare a Picasso to Michelangelo's Sixteen Chapel either, do you?<br/><br/>What is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? Well, first of all there is the director. Sergio Leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere, full of mystery, surprises and drama... He's one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end. <br/><br/>The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director's cut. <br/><br/>The second reason why this movie is so great is the music. Ennio Morricone, who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever, did an excellent job. Together with the images, the music speaks for itself in this movie. From time to time there isn't said a word, but the music and the images on their own tell the story. He understood perfectly what Sergio Leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot.<br/><br/>Last but not least there is also the acting and the script. The actors all did an excellent job. But what else can you expect from actors like Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci... They helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. The script helped them with it. It took twelve years to complete, but it hasn't left any detail untouched. The writers really thought of everything when creating it.<br/><br/>I can really recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to people who like the gangster genre. When you want to see the movie, you better be sure that you will have the time for it. This isn't a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. You'll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes, which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused, you'll find this one of the best movies you've ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10.",
    "Amistad is a very well crafted, well acted, and well told story. It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad 'mutiny', and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America's darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.<br/><br/>Amistad ranks as one of McConaughey's finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. <br/><br/>Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.",
    "I've noticed a lot of the negative comments about this title tend to focus on this movie's vulgar, 'stupid' humor. Now let's get one thing straight. Knocked Up is vulgar, absolutely it is, but is is not stupid. Stupid humor is crap like \"Mr. Woodcock\" and \"Good Luck Chuck,\" movies with no real craft to any of their jokes.<br/><br/>\"Jessica Alba fell down!!! Ahahahahahaha!\" <br/><br/>\"He yelled 'sex' really loud!!! Pssshhahahahahaaheheheheeee!\" <br/><br/>No. Die.<br/><br/>Knocked Up, on the other hand, is actually pretty clever most of the time. And even the movie's vulgarity isn't done in an over-the-top, simply-for-gross-out way (cite the fat bitch from Good Luck Chuck). It's what I guess you could call 'relevant vulgarity.' Anyway, the movie is extremely funny. Every joke is naturalistic, but not expected. The movie's characters are all convincing and multi-dimensional, and above all likable. Seth Rogan really does make the movie, though. He is hilarious, but he comes off more like a real nice, frank, down-to-Earth guy. Just the kind of guy you'd like to sit down and have a beer with. The kind of guy you'd more than like to get smashed with. The kind of guy you'd really like to have ill advised unprotected sex with. The kind of guy you'd love to raise a bastard child with. Needless to say, he's the reason the movie works.",
    "I found this thriller to be enjoyable. Lots of action - some of it pretty unbelievable - and some twists in the story. Very well acted on all parts. I really like Jolie much more in these action movies than the dramas she does.",
    "Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel \"Hearts of darkness\" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.<br/><br/>The film has a simple premise, US Army Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into Cambodia through a river, to assassinate a renegade, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. It's an accessible premise, allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers, and yet this film is anything but shallow. It's a journey into madness and hysteria, an observation into the darkness of humanity. I could write a book analyzing this film, there's just so much to talk about. My interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find Kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character's inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie, dehumanization. The journey through the river is also reminiscent of Dante's perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. There are three major stops before Kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought, as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.<br/><br/>The first stop is with lieutenant Kilgore. That stop shows that Kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. Their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can't comprehend the consequences the war will bring. In one scene of the movie, the \"heroic\" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies, Captain Kilgore uses Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures Valkyries, he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. At this stage, although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy, they still understand the innocent.<br/><br/>The second stop is the USO show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. At this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself, becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. The soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. Now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.\nThe last stop before Kurtz is the Do-long Bridge and it's at this point that a soldier has gone too far, he's experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can't return to a normal state of mind.<br/><br/>The final stop on the journey is Kurtz, at this point only Willard and Kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness, the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. Kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. Bypassing the madness stage he's able to see the world for what it truly is, filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. Willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. He kills Kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. In the end Willard has a choice, succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken Kurtz's place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon, he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving Lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe, he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. Both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn't, they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.<br/><br/>The film presents this study of the human psyche through Carmine Coppola's eerie score, hypnotic images, and some haunting scenes, essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. It's here where Coppola succeeds the most. His ability to create a living \"hell\" is so amazing, and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. It provides a commentary on war and religion, making the subtext even vaster. The film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film's runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat, and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner, conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer's breath away. Coppola's direction transcends itself, the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows, most notable during Col. Kurtz's first appearance. The troubled production obviously didn't hurt the film at all, and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. Apocalypse Now is beautifully haunting, utterly hellish, terrifyingly intelligent, and magnificently wrought, it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war, but also its meaningfulness and beauty. Not only is this one of the best films ever made, it's a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. It is Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. Rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon, immortal for its contribution to cinema, and a truly unforgettable experience, Apocalypse Now is cinema at its most complete, crystalline and pure.",
    "The trouble with making a children's film has always been to keep the kids happy but avoid making Mum and Dad fall asleep. Disney have always stuck to a solid \"one cute song for every acidic aside\" ratio which meant that the over-15's got Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy doing a stripped down routine whilst the 10 year olds got pretty pictures, cute animals and plenty of slapstick. This is what has made the House of Mouse the dominant toon makers but their mastery is under attack from Dreamworks SKG. While Walt & Co. delivered Mulan, Mr. Spielberg gave us Prince of Egypt and though Disney won, narrowly, the next round isn't going to be so easy.<br/><br/>Antz is brilliant. Don't let anybody tell you differently. We've got stunning visuals, great jokes, some brilliant scenes and some very likeable characters. What we have is a very smart film. Maybe too smart. The jokes are funny if you're old enough to get them. The sight of a neurotic ant lying on a therapist's leaf complaining about his anxious childhood is hilarious. Especially when the biggest neurotic in the world, Woody Allen, is delivering the lines. His timing, throughout the entire film, is exquisite and the script takes advantage of this at every opportunity i.e.:<br/><br/>Mandible: I like an ant that laughs in the face of death.<br/><br/>Z: Actually I stand behind Death and make belittling comments at its back.<br/><br/>It reads like one of Woody's early, funny films (sorry, but I couldn't resist it) and the rest of the cast are good too but that's because the script takes advantage of their history. Weaver acts like Stallone, Cutter acts like Walken and Barbatus acts like Glover. Anybody that's seen one of their films instantly recognises the voice behind the ant because of how they speak and act. They also bypass the sing-along route and insert a grisly battle sequence similar to Starship Troopers. The adults in the audience will love it. Children may be a little underwhelmed.<br/><br/>How many kids have seen an Allen, Stallone or Walken film? Not many I expect. How many kids have seen Troopers or Metropolis, (which is a big inspiration for the visuals)? Very few. There are a lot of jokes they just won't get. They may enjoy the pretty pictures but there's a distinct lack of cuddly animals, obvious slapstick or happy tunes. Boredom may set in and there may be a few cries during the battle sequence so be ready. Another downside is a slightly weak villain. Hackman does well with what he has but it's not much and truly cool bad guys like James Woods' Hades run circles round him.<br/><br/>Despite that Antz is a blast. As funny and enjoyable for adults as a child-orientated flick could be. It's not the best toon but it's a definite step forward. Maybe Disney have finally met their match.",
    "I am 31 so I was 3 when this movie came out. The first time I saw Saturday Night Fever was the \"Edited For Television\" version probably when I was 6 or 7 years old. At that point, it was about the music, the dance scenes and the clothes.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be until years later that I understood what a great story this is. It's a coming of age movie. It's a modern day tragedy. It's a love story.<br/><br/>The first thing that people think about when they hear Saturday Night Fever is disco and bell bottoms, but the story is timeless. Travolta plays Tony Manero, a loser in a nowhere job who only feels alive when he is on the dance floor at the local disco. There he is adored by his friends, by women and by strangers. There he is king. Everywhere else he is nobody. Even at home.<br/><br/>Tony becomes infatuated with a woman named Stephanie. On the surface Stephanie appears to be much better off than Tony. For the most part Stephanie is a big talker, but Tony is bothered by her observations.<br/><br/>\"Let me guess. You work all week long at some dead end job and then you go and blow it at all at 2001 (the disco) on the weekends. You're a cliché. You're no one, going nowhere.\" As much as Tony is upset by her words he can't argue with them. Soon Tony becomes frustrated with his \"station in life\" and tells Stephanie he wants out (of Brooklyn).<br/><br/>What makes Saturday Night Fever work so much for me is Tony is very typical of a lot of males who would rather have a good time and party now than build something toward the future. Bars are full of guys like Tony. Guys who are super stars in their local drinking establishments, but have no life outside of the night life.<br/><br/>And of course there's the superb dance scenes that most people remember Saturday Night Fever for. The soundtrack is also one of the best out there.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, Saturday Night Fever also has my favorite closing shot of all time. It's really nothing special, but I get choked up every time I see it.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever is also a snapshot of a period in recent American history. The movie took place in 1977. The country was a mess after the Vitenam war ended and before Reagan stormed Washington and once again instilled a sense of pride in Americans. There was no longer a war to protest, but the average American didn't have much faith in our country. I think Saturday Night Fever does an excellent job of capturing what was probably a common attitude among young adults during the late 70's. Live for the moment because the future is pretty bleak.",
    "Wow...I just got back from a preview showing of \"We Are Marshall,\" and I am still in shock I'll admit it, I originally only went to see this movie to see Matthew Fox. I mean I like football, but normally I wouldn't go to the theaters to see a movie on it. I expected it to be like a lot of sports movies--good, but repetitive and forgettable. However, I was completely wrong. The movie is excellent on so many levels. The acting is extremely good. Matthew Mcconaughey is extremely likable as the head coach, Matthew Fox is incredible as the assistant coach (especially his emotional scenes), and so is the supporting cast. The film itself is just extremely well-made as a whole, and extremely touching and moving.<br/><br/>Right now, I feel really bad that the movie hasn't gotten more buzz than it has. It was one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. I am surprised that it didn't get nominated for any Golden Globes because it really is probably better than a lot of the movies that got nominated. But really, it is an extremely good movie, and not just your typical, cliché, sports movie. It was such a nice surprise, and I am really glad i decided to see it.",
    "A stand-alone monument in cinema history, Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is an undeniable masterpiece. 2001 not only shattered science fiction genre conventions, but gave cinema a whole new meaning. From the grandiosity of its futuristic idea to its ambitious execution, 2001 isn't concerned with entertaining us- but rather to inspire us with awe. I've never seen a person say, \"2001: A Space Odyssey? I don't think I've seen it... oh wait, the one with like, the spaceships and stuff?\", while most movies today are forgotten once the credits roll. What viewers must understand is that 2001 not the type of movie where you \"get it\" or not, nor is it designed to thrill us with flashy special effects- but as Kubrick said, is \"...intended to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness.\" In it of itself, exploring the philosophical and scientific arenas of mankind while serving as a groundbreaking achievement both on a conceptual and technical level is a hell of an accomplishment, but to transcend the audience to a whole new dimension all in one- that's sheer genius at its highest form.<br/><br/>At its premiere, 2001 polarized critics and audiences alike. Walkouts numbered well over 200, including Rock Hudson who asked, \"Will someone tell me what the hell this is all about?\" The New York Times remarked, \"Somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring.\" \"Superb photography major asset to confusing, long-unfolding plot,\" Newsday commented. Renowned critic Pauline Kael even went as far as calling 2001 \"trash masquerading as art\". It's understandable, though. In a time in which excitement revolving around interstellar exploration and extra-terrestrial life was everyday talk, audiences came into 2001 expecting answers. When will we reach the moon? What does the future hold? Are we alone? To their great surprise, 2001 did the paradoxical; leaving more questions to answer than answered questions.<br/><br/>Even though the late 60s marked the height of technological optimism, Kubrick saw ahead, highlighting the potential negatives of technological advancement. Notice the contrast between how apes and humans approach the monolith. The apes approach it with dignity, respect, and mindfulness. The humans approach it with arrogance, grouping astronauts in front of the monolith to take a picture. Since the monolith represents the incomprehensible (man, with his limited senses, cannot comprehend the absence (perfect black) of color or light), Kubrick may be suggesting the manner in which we handle new information is careless and hasty, emphasized in the Clavius base briefing. Scientists discuss how to distribute this exciting news to the public, for \"if the facts were prematurely and suddenly stated without adequate preparation and conditioning\", as stated by Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester), it may cause \"cultural shock and social disorientation\". It's a significant message to the anxious people of 1968 to perceive fresh information precisely and draw conclusions logically.<br/><br/>Yet apes are not much better. They're not willing to share food and water with their fellow apes, and with the discovery of bones as weapons, kill their own race for a puddle of water- possibly foreshadowing our own demise if we continue to advance artificial intelligence. Because like our ancestors, at heart, mankind has been and will always be selfish.<br/><br/>Far before The Terminator (1984) or The Matrix (1999) accentuated the dangers of artificial intelligence, there was 2001. H.A.L 9000, voice played by Douglas Rain, was ingeniously crafted into one of the most terrifying villains in film history. There's something about his calm voice, unpredictability, and especially, his omniscient single red eye that's so frightening. Kubrick utilizes one of his favorite filmmaking devices to compare artificial intelligence with humans: irony. Neither Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) or Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) display much emotion throughout the film, while H.A.L, albeit a machine, exhibits some while pleading for life singing \"Daisy\" (which, by the way, is a heart-wrenching scene) and murdering his crew members. There are clear connotations of humanity's fate when H.A.L attempts to kill Frank, Dave, and the hibernating crew members. Yet H.A.L, contrast to what he may think, is not perfect. If he was incapable of miscalculating even the slightest bit, he wouldn't have gotten himself killed. Kubrick implies that artificial intelligence has not yet reached the level of annihilating the human race, but if we are not careful, they soon will.<br/><br/>This idea coincides with the perplexing final sequence, resembling man reaching the next stage of evolution. After the famous \"Star Gate\" sequence, Dave is enlightened in a room. The setting hints at the Enlightenment Era, exquisitely decorated in 18th century style and embellished with lavish paintings and furniture. Notice how the room is solely lit through the transparent ground, establishing a heavenly environment. The eerie silence is ominous, magnifying the mystical aura that is ever so present in the timelessness of the final scene. As Dave exits his EVA pod, he watches himself age rapidly through one-point perspective. He knocks over a wine glass while eating, suggesting that man, no matter how advanced, will keep making mistakes. As he lays on his deathbed later, he reaches out to the monolith, alluding to Adam reaching out to God in Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. After man is enlightened, he inevitably dies.<br/><br/>A pessimistic ending? No. Man is then transported back to Earth as a \"Space Baby\", an infinitely more advanced race, marking a new age of evolution. A masterful stroke of genius, Kubrick ends hopeful, giving us another chance to improve on our mistakes. Or is it hopeful? Is he implying that civilization is evolving badly? Or is he suggesting that civilization will NEVER evolve? There are multiple interpretations of the ending, and it's a question for you to answer.<br/><br/>There is such a great deal of symmetry in 2001's composition throughout the film, possibly suggesting the equilibrium present in the universe. The painstakingly slow pace also compliments the exactness of its harmony, practically forcing you to admire its artistry. While Andrei Tarkovsky's work would breathe with such organic and poetic beauty, Kubrick's artificial visual fluidity mesmerizes the eye with meticulous precision and thoroughness. Each shot, averaging 13.6 seconds, possesses a sense of purity and perfection that can only be achieved through the medium of cinema.<br/><br/>But of course, it's impossible not to talk about 2001 without mentioning one aspect. The visual effects are so unanimously praised that it's hopeless to even try to describe how groundbreaking and influential they were. Hopeless. I can talk for days about the impeccable zero-gravity effects, clever rotating sets, fastidiously constructed spaceships, the brilliant use of slit-scan photography for the psychedelic Star Gate sequence, or how it pioneered the use of front projection with retroreflective matting, but what's the point? You don't need me to appreciate 2001's immaculate visuals.<br/><br/>Finally, the choice of music is outstanding. Originally, Alex North was appointed to score the film, but Kubrick turned it down in post-production. Critic Roger Ebert explains it perfectly, \"North's (rejected) score, which is available on a recording, is a good job of film composition, but would have been wrong for 2001 because, like all scores, it attempts to underline the action-to give us emotional cues. The classical music chosen by Kubrick exists outside the action. It uplifts. It wants to be sublime; it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals.\"<br/><br/>\"But why all the slow parts?\" asks the one who fell asleep. Primarily, to establish tone. Unlike the low-budget commercial science fiction movies preceding it, 2001 was meant to be taken seriously. It symbolizes a quest for whether God exists or not, challenges humanity's fate, and questions evolution as a whole. If each shot's average length was two seconds and there was some sappy romantic love subplot mixed in between, the whole film would've been a mess. Space isn't fast-paced like we see in most movies. Space is slow-really, really, slow. The addition of three minutes and seventeen seconds of a black screen in the beginning was also pure genius, a signal for casual moviegoers to get out of the theater now and save your time.<br/><br/>Thankfully, its ingenuity was gradually recognized, and it's now widely regarded as one of the greatest and influential films of all time. It stands at an impressive #6 on the BFI \"Sight and Sound\" Critics' poll in 2012, ties for 2nd in the Director's poll, places 15th on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies, and tops the Online Film Critics Society list of \"greatest science-fiction films of all time\".<br/><br/>2001: A Space Odyssey breaks almost every rule there is in filmmaking. The first half drags, the dialogue is unnatural, the static camera creates no visual interest, there are barely any emotional punches, characters are monotonous, and none of the protagonists, if there even are, have dimensionality, arcs or epiphanies. Nonetheless, it's transcendental and sublime, awe-inspiring and thought-provoking, visually revolutionary, technically impeccable, monumentally imaginative, substantially rich, and way ahead of its time, thriving with unparalleled originality and ambition.<br/><br/>Only a few films will live forever. 2001 is one of them. Happy 50th birthday.",
    "Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.<br/><br/>This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.<br/><br/>In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word \"epic\" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.<br/><br/>10/10",
    "There has been next to no fanfare for the release of this murder mystery. Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in front of the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it (writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks of top-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with a heart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crime thriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allows the snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in a world that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally. When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feels like another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock is replaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemn defeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen's junior FBI agent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities if she's to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner's local hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a past family disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the former hiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-city attitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veteran character actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of how to deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy, well it is, but Sheridan's careful to inject a healthy dose of suspense and mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; the finale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictable but extremely effective manner. An intelligent, slow burning and provocative viewing that enthrals from start to finish, Wind River is an understated gem that deserves an audience.",
    "It was made to be silly. There's nothing in this movie that's meant to offend anyone. It's a silly, fun-loving, harmless movie. I enjoyed it when I was 8 and I still do now at 18. Anyone who takes this movie seriously, needs to relax, have fun, enjoy the goofiness. This movie is one you can enjoy with your friends, family and young children DON'T have to be sent out of the room for inappropriate action.<br/><br/>It's silly, remember that. It's supposed to make you laugh!<br/><br/>All the girls are young, and the band still together. A few years later, everything fell apart for them. Enjoy the youth and laughter while you can.",
    "From hit or miss comedy to Get Out, Jordan Peele proves to us that he has certainly matured as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Get Out is one of the best and most refreshingly original horror movies in the last decade.\nRather than having in your face predictable jump scares and cheesy music, Get Out dwells on the mind and relies on the fear of the unknown while giving subtle messages on racism and what's it like to be black in America and for an anti-racism movie everything is handled very well due to Peele's great writing.\nAs I've already mentioned the best aspect of Get Out is the writing; the characters are intelligent people and behave like logical human beings instead of cliché horror movie idiots. Everything happens for a reason and there is a meaning behind everything. Also unlike other horror movie clichés Get Out doesn't fake its scares or replaces them with needless humour. Instead, the humour (mainly Lil Rel Howery's character) is perfectly balanced with the story and shows up at adequate times.<br/><br/>Creepy, unsettling and filled with brilliant performances (primarily from Daniel Kaluuya) and even better writing, Get Out perfectly represents the US society in its current era.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8+/10",
    "I was very skeptical about this movie from the very beginning, because I thought that this would probably be a dumb monster movie with a similar theme like \"Beauty and the Beast\". However, I was very surprised when I saw the movie and think that it was brilliant!<br/><br/>After reading the reviews on this site, it is my understanding that many people that saw this move completely misunderstood it, both the people that loved it and the ones who hated it. <br/><br/>The theme of the movie is not something similar to Beauty and the Beast for those who might think that! <br/><br/>There are several themes in this movie, but the overall theme is about minorities and how privileged people view those who are different. However to make this message more clear the movie is set in the 1960's, where minorities were generally marginalized. <br/><br/>The lead character Elisa Esposito is a mute woman, who was an orphaned child that was found in a river with wounds on her neck and communicates through sign language. She works in a government laboratory as a cleaning lady. Her friends are her co-worker Zelda, a black woman who serves as an interpreter for Elisa, and her next-door neighbor Giles, a closeted gay man. Elisa discovers a mysterious creature in the facility and begins to bond with it. The creature is a mute humanoid amphibian that was captured in a river in South America by Strickland, who is in charge of the project to study it.<br/><br/>Elisa is the main protagonist in this story, and together with Zelda and Giles, they represent a social minority. Women, handicapped people, black people and gay people are all amongst those that were outcast by society at the time. On the other hand, there is Strickland who is the main antagonist in the story and he represents the privileged people at the time. He is a white man in a privileged position, married with children, religious, and is hostile to those who are not like him. He treats the creature hostilely, beats and abuses it, and calls it a monster.<br/><br/>When Elisa learns that Strickland plans to vivisect the creature, she hatches a plan with the help of her friends to free the creature and keeping it in a bathtub at her apartment and planning to set it free in the ocean. Elisa and the creature bond romantically and it is revealed that the creature has healing powers.<br/><br/>When the day arrives to set the creature free, Strickland arrives and shoots Elisa and the creature. The creature heals itself and kills Strickland. The creature takes Elisa and jumps into the ocean where it heals her. When the creature applies his healing touch to the scars on her neck, she starts to breathe through gills.<br/><br/>Here is the TWIST: This scene reveals that Elisa was of the same kind as the creature all along. She just had a more human like form than the creature. There are different clues throughout the film. She was found as child next to a river like the creature. She was found with the \"scars\" on her neck and they turned out to be dormant gills as the creature healed her. She was mute like the creature. She loved being in water as shown in her morning habits. She was initially attracted to the creature whereas most people would fear it. She comes from a Spanish speaking country, as her last name is Spanish whereas the creature was found in a river in South America.<br/><br/>The creature itself and Elisa represent a minority, as they are alike. The fact that the creature is different yet human like, symbolizes how privileged people viewed minorities at the time. The point of the monster is simply to symbolize how we sometimes view other people that are different from us.<br/><br/>The message of the story is this: You view other people that are different from yourself as \"monsters\" if you don't try to understand them. However, if you try to understand people who are different from yourself, then you will see that we are basically all alike even though we look different.<br/><br/>I think this movie was brilliant and very clever. Guillermo Del Toro did a great job. It is definitely a movie worth watching.<br/><br/>This is my point of view and I hope that you found this helpful.",
    "Much to my surprise, as I begrudgingly went to the movies with my 12 yr old son, I LOVED this film. I expected nothing, yet in return, I received a wonderful 1 hour and 40 minute respite from the real world, filled with slapstick humor and total silliness. Slapstick humor always walks a tightrope between bad taste and belly laughs. The Three Stooges are mind-numbingly inane: most laugh intensely and some never get the joke. Laurel and Hardy isn't for everyone either. Nacho Libre is not filled with Woody Allen irony, it doesn't have Christopher Guest's drollness, and it's not James Brook slick. It's not sophisticated humor! How can any film featuring Jack Black as a Mexican friar/fryer/wrestler/wannabe wooer ... all for the \"good of the orphans\" be taken seriously? It's simply for the 12 year old boy in all of us who laughs when Moe hits Curly and laughs when fat guys, even with over the top Mexican accents, are paired with skinny guys ... in a wrestling ring ... with stretchy pants.<br/><br/>I originally wrote this as a reply to a poster who asked if the mean IQ of people who liked this was 93, but the post was subsequently deleted. But to him I say, \"By the way, I'm a physician and my IQ is a tad over 93. But even if I had no job at all and even if my IQ was 93 ... who cares ... I laughed, with my son, eating popcorn, in the dark. And that's the joy of sharing a movie like this.\" No es?",
    "Child actors are a dime a dozen, yet Abraham Attah is something else. He transcends the category and remains such a demanding presence throughout the entire film, matching even Idris Elba's poise. His character's transformation is just one of the remarkable feats of storytelling that Beasts of No Nation graces us. A gripping account of modern day war seen through a child's eyes, Beasts of No Nation is easily one of the best of the year.<br/><br/>The first thing you'll notice is how beautiful the film is. The stark landscapes of West Africa draw you in, and the color palette for the film is quite something. Director and cinematographer Cary Fukunaga makes sure you remember the reality of this not-so-fictional story, paralleling Agu's family life and how his world was flipped upside down when he joined a group of mercenary fighters. Initially, Agu has no choice and uses them as an escape and a way to reunite with his mother, but the ruthless commandant (Elba) changes him.<br/><br/>The writing is fantastic as you see the war through Agu's eyes, and it's not pretty. This kind of situation is almost completely unfamiliar for most audiences, and Fukunaga manages to supplement fear for grace. He never lets us forget the harsh realities of war, touching on familiar themes like family but going a step further by making it personal for Agu. As the film is his story through and through, the adult details of war are kept to a minimum. The audience is just like Agu, unaware of exactly why there is fighting but rolling with it because it's his only choice. There's no strategic battle scenes, no planning on a map or signing peace treaties, as we are thrust into moments just like Agu is.<br/><br/>When the violence does break out, it's brutal and harrowing. Young actor Attah is ferocious yet sympathetic, and he brings these battle sequences down to earth. The creative risks that Fukunaga takes with these sequences might come across as pandering, yet they make sense cinematically and come across as action poetry. There's a certain lyricism to the war torn villages and jungles of the continent, and it's beautiful and unforgettable.<br/><br/>There isn't much dialogue in the film, but when there is it's brilliant. The unnamed commandant's ideology becomes clearer as the film goes on, and it reaches a disturbing peak. Fukunaga contrasts him with the initially innocent Agu and the two are at odds yet retain respect for one another. There are times when Agu could simply point a gun at the commandant and be done with it, but there's a humanity to the film that respects all lives. War isn't pretty, and Beasts of No Nation knows that. Yet this risky piece of entertainment remembers to be a film first and everything else second. The result is a rhythmic work of art with one of the best young performances I've seen.",
    "As Ang Lee, I grew up reading wuxia novels in Taiwan. Those novels usually mixed engrossing history, thrilling action, enchanting romance. But when these novels were made into movies or TV series, none of them could match my imagination. It's either because of wrong casting, bad acting, tedious costumes, sloppy storytelling, minimal budget (so everything is shot in studio rather than in the grand Chinese landscapes as they were told in books), fake action... I could go on and on. Now Ang Lee finally made a wuxia film that captures my imagination and fulfills my dream of childhood.<br/><br/>\nThe casting of CTHD is perfect. No disrespect to Jet Li, but Jet Li would not make Li Mu Bai into what he should be: noble, wise but weary. Chow Yun Fat conveys the unspoken feelings of Li Mu Bai in a way I can't imagine anyone else can. But he's known for his acting, Michelle Yeoh was known for her fighting skills. Here in CTHD, she proves herself as an excellent dramatic actress. The secrete longing for Li and the confusion of Li's true feelings were clearly conveyed by her eyes. The scenes between them are heartbreaking. Zhang Zi Yi is a true discovery! What a wonderful talent to steal scenes after scenes from the veterans around her. She ran from looking innocent, haughty, feisty to loving and distraught. She made the complex Jen a real flesh and blood believable human being. Chang Chen made a perfectly sexy and charming bandit.<br/><br/>The scenery and the photography was beyond belief. The majestic landscapes of China match my imagination when I read all the beautiful Chinese poems of the Tang and Sung dynasties. No wonder those poets could come up with those masterpieces. They sure had the best inspiration. Peter Pau not only captured the landscapes and the settings, he also managed to capture the fast-as-lightening action wonderfully. The shot of Jen gliding over water just lodged in my mind. The soundtrack is also excellent. Tan Dun used different instruments to match the different locales. He mixed in Central Asian music in the desert sequence and Chinese flute in the Southern China scenes. Yo-yo Ma's cello in the main theme makes me want to weep everytime I hear it.<br/><br/>The storytelling was also done expertly. As a romantic-at-heart, I love the desert romance between Jen and Lo. It's one of the most charming and believable love stories that I can remember. Most people gave credit of the fighting to Yuen Wo Ping. I'd give kudos to Ang Lee. I've seen Yuen's martial art films before, but they're never done in such an imaginative and artistic way. The artistic vision has to come from Ang Lee.<br/><br/>To sum it up, three cheers for Ang Lee! You not only fulfilled your childhood dream, you fulfilled mine too. It's such a pleasure to finally see a wuxia novel be done right. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!",
    "Match Point just joined Brokeback Mountain and Cinderella Man in the top three films for me this year. Like Brokeback Mountain, however, it is almost impossible to write a reasonably intelligent review without writing a spoiler.<br/><br/>I have been a hot and cold Woody Allen watcher, but was only a fan during his comedic phase. So, despite hearing from a few reliable sources that this is Woody's masterpiece, I was skeptical and went in with few expectations. I am glad. Approaching the movie this way allowed it to creep up on me. <br/><br/>The NYC Jewish dialog is gone. The quirky sense of humor is nowhere to be found. the hypersensitivity is missing. Where's Woody? Well, he's in London, but the place and time, despite the opinions of some critics, are largely irrelevant in this film.<br/><br/>There is only one line in this film that indicates its origin - it has something to do with 'intertwined neuroses' and nearly made me laugh. <br/><br/>The first 3/4ths of this film is almost completely taken up with character development, but also contains all of the basics of the inexorable plot that truly unfolds near the end. The characters are all quite likable, and, if you're like me, you will yearn for a happy ending. Watch out! - you've just been hooked and Woody's about to reel you in! <br/><br/>Match Point draws its audience in quietly and slowly at first, defining its territory as a smart, hip, and sophisticated character study early on (in no way unexpected for Mr. Allen), but then it takes an irreversibly sinister turn as one man threatens to bring everybody we have grown to love and respect down with him. <br/><br/>The performances and cinematography in this film are all-around the best I've seen this year. Allen uses a lot of very close-in face shots, and his cast handles it with ease, performing their parts with accuracy and no lack of passion. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Emily Mortimer, and Scarlett Johanssen are all excellent, and the rest of the cast lends excellent support. I found no fault in the pace or the plot - this is easily Woody's most plot-heavy film, and you can tell that he had a great time putting it together. <br/><br/>The story line of Match Point is powerful, disturbing, and exceedingly clever. Philosophical folks will likely want to talk about it afterward. Some will find it frustrating and others will find it pretentious. Still others will point to Woody's own life and claim that this film is some form of perverse confession. Well, from my perspective, it is simply damn good story-telling.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for adult audiences.",
    "Tony D'Amato(Al Pacino) is the head coach of the Miami Sharks who are owned by the Christina Pagniacci(Cameron Diaz) who is using the Miami Franchise only for profit. Trouble stirs up after long time star quarterback Cap Rooney(Dennis Quaid)is injured along with his back up bringing in third string quarterback Willie Beamen(Jamie Foxx) who becomes the face of the franchise after having great game after great game. The only problem is that he plays only with his head and not with his heart, with an aging team that needs an emotional leader to guide them to victory. Also Starring: James Woods, Matthew Modine, LL Cool J, Bill Bellemy, Lawrence Taylor, Charelton Heston, Aaron Eckhart, and John C. McGinley.<br/><br/>In a cinema that rarely produces pro football movies, this is the cream of the crop. It captures the reality along with the heroic story of a nobody rising to the top. The movie is humorous, dramatic, and a thriller for all sports fans.<br/><br/>This is not only one of Oliver Stone's best films but this is also the start of Jamie Foxx's \"good\" acting career. Forget what the critics said about Collateral or Ray being the beginning for Jamie Foxx. It was Any Given Sunday. Willie Beaman is a complex character and Foxx nailed the part. He was magnificent. He played the part to perfection and out shined the great Al Pacino. The supporting cast was also incredible with great performances from Cameron Diaz, LL Cool J, James Woods, and surprisingly John C. McGinley. It is very rare to find a great dramatic football movie but this is definitely one those small few.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the greatest sports movies of all time and it is highly enjoyable for adult audiences.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "Yes, the original film was like a lot of 80s movies--campy, silly and sometimes just about the music—but this remake should have been forgotten. While the writers kept quite a few original lines and the director kept some iconic scenes, something was lost in translation. That loss cannot be blamed on any one part of the film but rather the disgraceful whole.<br/><br/>There some changes that I enjoyed. The opening scene, though storyline changed a bit, had more of an impact behind the impetus of the town's laws. The dancing was top notch by today's standards though a little raunchy a time or two. Kenny Wormald did justice to Kevin Bacon's dance in the warehouse, changing it just enough to make it his own. Julianna Hough kept up with him every step of the way during the dance scenes. Even the at the end, it was refreshing in this day of girl-power to see the football team told by a teammate to \"man-up\" and ask the girls to dance.<br/><br/>That said, the rest of the film is an empty cardboard parody, lacking any sense of poignancy that endeared the original to a generation. The soundtrack fell below the standard set in 1984, though they sort of kept Whitney Houston's original \"Let's Hear it for the Boy\" when Willard learns to dance (a highlight in both films). Also, they changed Beamis Mill (which I believe dealt with concrete) to a cotton gin mill, very poor taste.<br/><br/>The characters are hollow and thanks to the deletion of several key scenes, the actors are not given a chance to redeem themselves and give us characters we can empathize with.<br/><br/>Kenny Wormald was a great choice for the dancing scenes. It's impeccable and when when he dances you can feel his passion come through the screen. His acting, however, was limited to cockiness and poker face. Kenny seemed to struggle to find the balance in that sweet spot between underacting and overacting. Two scenes that clearly show this is when his aunt asked him why the dance was important and when he stands before the town counsel. Both times lack passion, conviction and inflection. He could very well have been reading the nutrition panel on the side of a bag of bread. The closest I came to identifying with him was when his Uncle talked about him taking care of his mom. Kenny could not seem to remember he was supposed to be a rebel with a cause and not just another rebellious teenager.<br/><br/>Julianna Hough is gorgeous and confident. Confidence like hers can hinder a performance when you are supposed to be playing a wild child who is acting out because of insecurity. I am trying to give her the benefit of the doubt as key scenes were not in the film that would have brought depth to her character. You miss out on the deep reasons behind the hurt and vulnerability that Lori Singer pulled off wonderfully. For example, the scene about types of music in the original between Ariel and Shaw went a long way to deepen the dynamics of father-daughter relationship, and helped build each character's journey in the minds and hearts of the audience. Or the scene with the music box, showed the vulnerability of Ariel as she shared who she really is with Ren, brave and yet fearful of rejection for her real self. Those scenes might have saved Hough's performance. Instead, her version of Ariel came across as an angry brat who looked good dancing.<br/><br/>Dennis Quaid looked ill-at-ease throughout the entire movie, and even when he's angry he looks like he might lose his breakfast. Again, I am trying to give his performance the benefit of the doubt as they cut several key character-development scenes which would have shown how he grew throughout the course of the film. For example, the book-burning scene in the original is a major turning point for this character. John Lithgow's heart (original) could be seen in that scene when he sees what he's done. It's a point of no return when he had to really think about what he'd done and why and how he will proceed. Had they kept that scene, he would have reason, he would have believability. Now, instead, Shaw comes across as another fumbling close-minded dad/leader who had no clue about real life until his wife and daughter school him, along with a very brief talk with Ren.<br/><br/>Andie MacDowell didn't have much chance with the majority of Vi's scenes cut. That said, had been included them it would not have mattered. Only once during this film did she remind me of the quiet strength and dignity that Dianne Wiest brought to the role (town meeting). Her few scenes with Dennis Quaid are almost belittling and instead of the gentle correction of Vi quietly convicting Shaw Andie's Vi seemed to constantly condemn him.<br/><br/>Miles Teller as Willard is probably the most enjoyable of the entire cast. I know some out there have decried his performance, but I think he took the role and made it his own while retaining the child-like naiveté that was Willard. He was a little on the over-sexed teen side of things in this film (which got old), but otherwise, he was fun to watch.<br/><br/>The flaws are many in this film. I would give this film 2 out of 5 stars simply for the dancing, The tag line is \"Cut Loose\" and they stripped away any of the sentimentality that would have made this a fun film to watch over and over again.<br/><br/>They removed what made Footloose so foot loose. They simply cut too loose.",
    "The internet is a funny place... it seems to be filled with people who have graduated with 5 Ph.Ds. and clearly seem to be smarter than everybody else (thousands of astronauts and astrophysicists on IMDb apparently). One star rating? Come on... Clearly, you haven't watched enough films to know decent from terrible.<br/><br/>I watched this film without having heard of it (no trailers, spoilers or anything). I'm a sci-fi fan and thought this was a good watch.<br/><br/>I found the characters to lack depth and their actions were questionable at times but the plot was believable and the acting decent. Special effects were good and made the movie believable in my opinion. The movie was well shot and I thought the scenes with the creature were pretty cool.<br/><br/>I don't get how people even compare this movie to \"Aliens\"; it's nothing alike. Overall, I thought it was pretty good.",
    "The Clash of the Titans remade is more like a brute version of it. It's fun but its a mess. It's more of a spectacle rather than telling a story bout the whole mythology epic with its characters though I'm seeing a lot of CGI extravaganza with over the top results which my eyes are bleeding like hell . This is one of those films where there are a lot of super good casts in a bad production.",
    "I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in the TOP 10, but that this one isn't even in the TOP 100.<br/><br/>This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie:<br/><br/>-The Rescue of Han Solo from Jabba: This official wraps up the Han Solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in A NEW HOPE.<br/><br/>-The Emperor was Finally Revealled: Well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw The Emperor as kids.<br/><br/>-The Speeder Bike Chase: Alright, so this was a special effects moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films!<br/><br/>-The 3 Part Climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (Led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke Confronts his Father & The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Destruction of the Second Death Star (Lando's Moment)<br/><br/>-The Final Celebration with Our Heroes: Like I said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the Ewoks but I think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other.<br/><br/>All in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the STAR WARS story.",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "The first time I saw To Kill A Mockingbird was at a drive-in theater.  I was probably about ten or eleven at the time.  Even at a young age I was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that I could easily relate to.  Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, held a kind of mystery and an eeriness for me, much in the way a ghost story would.  I'm not about to make the pretense that I understood the social significance of To Kill A Mockingbird at the age of ten, or even the greatness of the film.  That would come later in life, after having viewed it in one of it's first network television broadcasts.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes To Kill A Mockingbird a truly great film is the love and respect everyone involved in bringing Harper Lee's novel to the screen had for the original source material.  It shows up on screen in every single frame.  Each performance in this film is beyond reproach.  Gregory Peck had many fine performances over his storied career, but none every approached the perfection he brought to his portrayal of Atticus Finch.  As Atticus, Peck brings us the depth of understanding as to how his love for Jem and Scout enables him to treat his children with respect and honesty. He never talks down to them, but approaches them on a level in which children of their age can comprehend and learn from his own wisdom.  Yet, he is still able to retain the same no nonsense approach as other parents. Atticus is also a man who believes in the integrity of justice, yet recognizes the failings of our justice system.  When called upon to do his duty, he does so, despite the hatred and venom brought to bear upon him and his children by the citizens of the town in which he lives.<br/><br/>In casting Jem, Scout and Dill, Producer Alan J. Pakula and Director Robert Mulligan faced a daunting task.  So much of the success of To Kill A Mockingbird depended on the pivotal role these characters would play in the film.  For Jem he chose Philip Alford, for Scout, Mary Badham, and for Dill, John Megna.  Alford and Badham were both southern natives who had never been in films before.  Megna was a New York native but was also inexperienced. It is this inexperience and lack of polish that enables all three to shine on the screen.  Mulligan began filming by letting them act as if making a film was like recess, allowing them to play on the set, and only moving the camera gradually as they became accustomed to their surroundings.  It paid off in every way imaginable.  None of the three ever appear as if they are actors acting, and bring a childlike wonder and presence to their roles that I had never seen before, and will unlikely witness again.<br/><br/>Brock Peters as Tom Robinson, the black man falsely accused of raping a white girl, also gives a performance which he would never again surpass. You will not find anywhere a more memorable scene in any court room than when he testifies on the witness stand.  Because he dared to care about a white girl, he now faces almost certain death if convicted, and perhaps even if not convicted.  It is the first time I was able to begin to understand the effects of man's prejudice and hatred of a man simply because of the color of his skin.  Just as Jem and Scout came of age, and realized the significance of the injustices of racial hatred, so did I.<br/><br/>Equally significant, is Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell. She makes it easy for many to hate her, but like Atticus, we see in her a person to be more pitied than hated.  She is a product of not only the times in which she lives, but even more so of her wretched upbringing.  Mayella is what she is, but only because of the deep cutting prejudices of those around her.  To Mayella, being caught enticing a black man into your house for relations, is the ultimate crime and the penalty for doing so is unthinkable to her.<br/><br/>\nIn his screen debut as Boo Radley, Robert Duvall also brings to life the mysterious neighbor that once frightened Jem, Dill, and Scout so much. Though on the screen for a short length of time, without uttering a word, Duvall shows us a man tortured by years of cruelty, mistreatment, and the gossip and whispers of neighbors.  He is a man who wants only to live in his own way, yet the bond that links him to Jem and Scout is significant.  They are the childhood he had never really known.  Just as Tom Robinson, he has never brought harm to anyone, yet suffers significantly just for the right to be able to exist.<br/><br/>The care with which To Kill A Mockingbird was brought to the screen can also be seen in the Art Direction by Henry Bumstead and Set Decoration by Oliver Emert.  They indeed bring to life what a small Southern Town would have been like in the early thirties. Cinematographer Russel Harlan's black and white photography brings it all vividly to the screen, especially in the way he captures the foreboding of the Radley house, the moments when Bob Ewell approaches Jem when he is left in a car alone, and even more noteworthy near the end of the film when Jem and Scout are walking home from a school play. Elmer Bernstein's score is never boisterous, but yet is as important to setting the mood of many of the scenes played out before us.<br/><br/>There have been many eloquent words written in many of the comments on this board about To Kill A Mockingbird. Many of the words are far better than those that I have written.  Then again, maybe a few simple paragraphs cannot truly describe the significant achievement in film making that To Kill A Mockingbird is.  It will be forever remembered, long after you and I have departed from this world.  It is at this point that I usually grade a film. I will skip that here, simply because there is no grade that I can give that could possibly do justice for To Kill A Mockingbird.",
    "In this 2nd installment of John Wick, the stylish visual and hard core action returns twice the level of the first film. So prepare for another suspenseful and cliffhanging sequences flow from this action movie when you watch this. The story goes deeper and the action scenes were incredibly entertaining! The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film. The ending of this film opened the possibility of many more franchise of this movie.",
    "\"Not only is Singer's film-making aesthetically frustrating (lacking coherent visual rhythm) but his juvenile regard of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler -- one of 15 documented attempts -- is intellectually insulting...\" New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film. Critics bashed it for being insulting, unoriginal, and unmoving. Let me make some corrections for them so that they can save a little face.<br/><br/>I'm no Tom Cruise fan. A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in. Mostly this has to do with Cruise's personal life and beliefs (just watch an episode of South Park to see how some people view him and you'll see what I mean). People have similar feelings toward Mel Gibson ...but I digress.<br/><br/>VALKYRIE, as most of you probably now know, is the final of 15 attempts on Hitler's life. Shortly after this (about nine months) he committed suicide in his bunker. But this is about the one time where it almost succeeded. I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...<br/><br/>What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.<br/><br/>It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.<br/><br/>If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that \"I was on the edge of my seat\" throughout the second half of the film.<br/><br/>So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.",
    "I have seen \"Bloody Sunday\" twice now - once on the big screen and once on DVD - and read Don Mullen's book, \"Eyewitness Bloody Sunday.\"  This movie is a very realistic depiction of the defining moment of the \"troubles\" in Northern Ireland.  The hand-held cameras and grainy film style make it feel more like a documentary than a movie, which of course is the intent.  As another reviewer has mentioned, the acting is very natural throughout.  It does take some time to get started, but once the the shooting starts it hits the viewer like a sledgehammer.  Very powerful.<br/><br/>     The film jumps so frequently from scene to scene that at times it is distracting, though I was much less annoyed by this the second time around. And, having seen it once with and once without subtitles, I must say that although the subtitles (optional on the DVD) are intrusive they are quite welcome.  I love the Irish accent but at times it can be difficult for me to decipher,and much of the dialogue in the movie is muted.  It was good to know what was being said.  <br/><br/>    As for the objectivity, of course the movie is slanted - so was the situation.  But it is not unreasonably slanted.  The British are not shown as one-dimensional demons - in particular, Nicholas Farrell does a great job of conveying Brigadier Mclellan's ambiguity and even disapproval of the course taken against his wishes by the supposed \"Observer,\" Maj. Gen. Ford (who, if the movie has a villain, is the prime candidate.)  At one point early on several Paras are discussing the day's prospects, and reveal how tired they are of being harassed, shot at and otherwise abused by the native population.  This makes the day's events more understandable.  This does not EXCUSE the cold-blooded gunning down of 27 people - there is no excuse for that - but at least one can see a contributing factor.  And protesters are shown, once or twice, firing back.  (The key here is firing BACK - evidence indicates that no marchers fired until the first two protesters were wounded.  And those scattered few that attempted return fire were quickly dissuaded by their countrymen.  Later in the day the IRA did go into action, but not until after the bloodletting in Bogside was over with.)  Ivan Cooper's (James Nesbitt) words at the close of the film were shown to be all too true in the years since the actual incident.  The IRA was on unsteady legs at the time, but has never lacked support since January 30, 1972.<br/><br/>     The film is a powerful object lesson concerning the misuse of force, and one that governments everywhere - including my own country, the United States - should take to heart.  It has a few flaws, but I think deserves the awards it has received.  8/10 points.",
    "Anyone who knows me knows my favorite band is The Beach Boys, and my favorite musician is their leader, Brian Wilson. I first got deep into their music last November when I heard their album SMiLE, an album which wasn't officially released until 45 years after its conception and recording. It was worth the wait, as I consider it the best album I've ever heard.<br/><br/>I found out that a biopic of Wilson was in the works, and would be screening at SXSW with Wilson in attendance. I knew I had to go and see this film. The experience is one that will stick with me for the rest of my life as one of the most emotionally powerful events I have been a part of.<br/><br/>Love and Mercy is the story of The Beach Boys' founder Brian Wilson. The film chronicles his rise to fame in the 1960's and the his decline into mental illness, and his escape from the control of his therapist in the 1980's.<br/><br/>Paul Dano plays Wilson in the 1960's, and John Cusack plays him in the 1980's. It also stars Elizabeth Banks as Wilson's future wife, Melinda Ledbetter, and Paul Giamatti as his therapist, Eugene Landy.<br/><br/>Paul Dano exudes the boyish look of young Wilson perfectly. He relearned how to play piano for the role, and sings much of the music in the film.<br/><br/>His performance is hard to watch at times because of how depressing it is seeing him devolve from an energetic, fun young man into a tortured, drained artist. Dano handles the role with passion and care, and his performance never feels forced or fake.<br/><br/>When Wilson begins to suffer a panic attack, anyone who's had one will feel deeply for him. When he starts to have physical symptoms of depression after years of physical and mental abuse from his father and disapproval of his musical direction from fellow band mate Mike Love, Dano portrays the hurt that comes from those events with subtle facial expressions and natural transition.<br/><br/>John Cusack looks less like Wilson physically, but his performance may be even more complex. His Wilson has been to the bottom, and he brilliantly portrays how challenging it is to rebuild your life after going through mental and physical anguish.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Banks has a great departure from her more well known comedic film roles, and as Ledbetter, she shows her strength and respect for the man she loves through actions and subtle expressions instead of overt, over the top dialog.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti has the most campy role in the film as Eugene Landy, but this is unfortunately how Landy was in real life. He was as violent and controlling over Wilson's life as the movie portrays, so his abusive, manipulative, angering performance is highly accurate.<br/><br/>One of the best things about Love and Mercy is that it doesn't exaggerate or make up events to make the film more interesting. The filmmakers trust the strength of its source material is interesting enough to make for a great story.<br/><br/>The storytelling structure of the movie is interesting and risky. The film jumps from the 60's to the 80's without warning, and it works. The slightly askew technique allows the audience to experience the downfall and uprising of Wilson's life simultaneously, and allows the movie to end on a happy note.<br/><br/>One complaint people have is that the film skips over the 1970's, Wilson's most tumultuous period in which he weighed 300 pounds and spent the majority of three years in bed, crippled by depression and drug addiction. However, this allows the audience to examine the reasons for his downfall and redemption instead of indulging in the horrible escapism Wilson turned to.<br/><br/>Beach Boys fans will appreciate the movie more than the average film-goer. Mike Love in hats, dancing, and mentioning \"the formula\"? Check. Drug tent and piano in the sandbox in Wilson's living room? Check. The infamous \"Fire\" session? Check. Everything is on point, from the scarily accurate wardrobe down to recreating the \"Sloop John B.\" and \"Surf's Up\" promo videos shot for shot. It's these moments that show the film was made by fans with an attention for detail.<br/><br/>Almost every song on the album Pet Sounds is featured in the film somewhere. Seeing Wilson's unorthodox recording techniques is such a pleasure for music nerds.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Robert Yeoman, best known for creating the look of Wes Anderson's films, blends stylistic tone with realistic camera work, creating a sense of false nostalgia that is surreal yet inviting and intense.<br/><br/>Composer Atticus Ross works wonders with the score, using a great wealth of Wilson's music in different ways and choosing songs that fit with the emotional tone of the scene brilliantly. Hearing the instrumental version of \"Don't Talk\" play as Wilson takes LSD for the first time is haunting. Witnessing the song \"Til' I Die\" play over a surreal, Kubrickian scene in which Wilson has an epiphany made me cry because of the powerful combination of imagery and music.<br/><br/>The film is being released on June 5, to capitalize on The Beach Boys music being a staple of the summer, but it feels more like a Thanksgiving release to me. The cinematography, acting, script, and score are all Oscar worthy in my opinion, but the film may get lost in the race to other contenders, which is a shame.<br/><br/>Love and Mercy is an awesome, unorthodox biopic that takes risks with form and narrative that has strong performances, script, cinematography, and of course, an amazing soundtrack. It will expose young people to the brilliance of Wilson's music and give older fans an insight into why Wilson is the poster boy for using creativity as an escape and an outlet from the pain of life and mental illness.<br/><br/>And seriously, listen to the album SMiLE.",
    "Spectre was a classy action movie....making the expected James Bond signatures always look new. loved the suave and class of our favourite British spy. Daniel Craig just re-immersed us in giving us another classic to relish for years.",
    "I'll start this off with a warning. If you're a mainstream horror fan, you will not like this. It is not The Conjuring, it does not have jump scares, it is a slow movie. It's not scary in the way that most horror films are scary. It doesn't frighten you. It felt traumatic. This is an artsy movie for sure. If you don't like that, don't see it.<br/><br/>Florence Pugh is absolutely phenomenal. She provides the heart for the film and is what keeps the audience emotionally invensted in such a disturbing film. It's one of the greatest horror performances that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The cinematography is stunningly gorgeous. I've never seen a film look so gory and grotesque and yet absolutely beatiful at the same time. It's some of the best cinematography that I've seen in years. The art direction is also phenomenal in providing us with a floral, candy colored, nightmare world.<br/><br/>And Ari Aster's screenplay and direction is what makes this so special and separates it from other horror pieces. It's slow, methodical, eerie. But the characters are psychological and deep. The dialogue is real and colorful. The plot is surreal and disturbing. He let's the scares crawl at you as opposed to jump at you. He allows you to see what will happen, process it, feel the shock of what's about to happen, and then still shock you even more when it happens.<br/><br/>This film will be divisive. I have no doubt that many people here will hate this. However, while this is a challenging film, it's also a great film. Halfway through a character says something along the lines of \"That was so messed up, but I'm trying to keep an open mind.\" I suggest that audiences take this advice.<br/><br/>PSA, this movie is extremely violent, bloody, and gory. It's pretty horrifying and it could have stuff that is triggering.",
    "A true best of both worlds for classic Disney and classic Pixar fans. It had already been many years since the acquisition, but for me this was the first time Disney's buyout felt like a positive direction for the animation pioneers. Filled with possibly Pixar's most attractive environments, character designs (Side note: Merida has my favorite character design of any animated human character. I mean seriously her hair alone is a thing of beauty.), and easily its best score, the studio does a deft send up of classic princess movies while instilling the pure feeling of magic they are known for though Scotland's rich Celtic lore and cryptic mysticism. Brave is a criminally underrated installment in the Pixar cannon that I hope grows in stature over the years. If Wreck It Ralph is Disney doing Pixar, Brave is Pixar doing Disney.",
    "As a fan of the book, I really wasn't sure I wanted to see this movie. Great books hardly ever adapt into good films. But my friend wanted to see it, so I agreed to tag along on opening night. <br/><br/>I have to say, as a movie, it is genuinely enjoyable. The visuals are starkly entrancing without being distracting. The casting is pitch-perfect - Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield, in particular, do a great job. The ending is particularly well done (don't worry - it wasn't really spoiled by the trailer). <br/><br/>The problem is, it's really just a caricature of the book. The drama in Battle School moves too quickly, the characters of Peter and Valentine are almost completely absent, and even Ender's video game is sadly underdone. I'm not usually a fan of splitting books into multiple movies, but this is one where two films would have done it justice. Also, the kids are just too old - there's an ironic moment in the movie where two officers talk about how conscripting kids under 15 \"used to be illegal\", yet all the actors playing the kids look 15 or older!<br/><br/>Still, it's a fun ride, and if you hadn't read the book these flaws really wouldn't be apparent. Definitely see it in the theater if you can - the battle room scenes are best on a big screen.",
    "I really enjoy the Star Trek TV series (original, TNG and DS9) and admit that I am late to this review. As much as I enjoy Star Trek and its ideals I had watched Star Wars The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams and I hated that. Star Wars rebooted with completely non-plot for pre-teens and one-liners, wise-cracks and plot holes so big that even Donald Trump's ego could drive through them was not for me.<br/><br/>So, anyway with a certain amount of hesitation I finally watched the reboot of Star Trek.... and it was as bad as I feared. Since it was expected I was not disappointed, but by gosh what is with the people who hire the director JJ Abrams? He makes every character a cartoon character. Never mind that the utopian and progressive society of the Federation is completely glossed over and ignored, but these characters with the formulaic backgrounds and corny lines and false tensions is just terrible. The Vulcans and Romulans' feud has never been as cliché-ridden I would say.<br/><br/>Look, I get it. People pay for reboots and remakes and sequels and so Hollywood serves them up (or is it the other way around?), but use some imagination, have one novel or original idea at least. I am too old for cartoons... which explains why I won't be watching the next Star Trek or fifteen Star Wars coming out. Obviously the director JJ Abrams is specialized in reboots and remakes and sequels and not original ideas.",
    "Over the years Akshay Kumar's choice of selecting the films has certainly improved with significant examples being Holiday, Baby, Special Chabbis, Gabbar Is Back to name few. Move over commercial masala potboilers with item songs, hero smashing 10 guys with a single blow and typical song-dance routine – Raja Menon's Airlift will give you goosebumps with fast-paced gritting thrills and excitement.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Airlift speaks about the Ranjit Katyal (played by Akshay Kumar) who helps the Indian Government collaborate with Air India to help evacuate 1,70,000 Indians from Kuwait after Iraq raided the country.<br/><br/>From the director of critical acclaimed films like Bas Yun Hi and Barah Aana, Raja Menon does a fantastic research about the feat that was even recorded in the Guinness Book of World Record and surprisingly people are unaware about it. Airlift will consume you right from the beginning especially when Akshay's family faces the issue of Iraqi raiding Kuwait. From here onward, there is no turning back as the movie gives you nice twist-n-turns with well- choreographed action scenes. Icing on the cake is the climax scenes which has been well executed. On the flip side, length of the movie could have been reduced little further. But brilliant screenplay, Art direction and cinematography is spellbinding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Dialogues are fine. The music of the film is doing well on the chartbuster. The soulful number such as 'Soch Na Sake' is already a superhit among the viewers. Besides, other tracks are catching up fast as well.<br/><br/>It is Akshay Kumar's show all the way. A thumbs up to him for doing something different from his usual masala potboilers. After giving back-to-back hits in 2015 with Baby, Gabbar Is Back and Singh Is Bliing, Akshay Kumar is definitely on a roll. With Holiday, Baby and now Airlift, Akshay Kumar has managed to create a image of \"Mera Bharat Mahaan\" actor and fans will love him in new avatar. The fresh pairing of Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur works well. Nimrat Kaur's realistic subtlety would harness Akshay Kumar's machismo and give us that perfect thriller<br/><br/>Overall , Airlift is nail-biting, reality-based action thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4.5/5",
    "This is a bad film, I know that right off the bat. Some pretty bad acting, camera work and scene slow-mo, ridiculous action parts, like Alice jumping 30 feet in the air over a fence. But, these Resident Evil films are pure guilty pleasure films. I loved the Nemesis creature (Matt). That all this movie is, pure guilty pleasure.",
    "\"Shaun of the Dead\" is not only the best zombie flick I've seen in a long time, it is simply the best film I've seen in a long time, PERIOD! Clever, witty, sweet and nasty and, at times, gory and horrific, SOTD has it all. Of course, I didn't think I could go very far wrong with a film that George Romero himself said he enjoyed.<br/><br/>Shaun (Simon Pegg) isn't having a very good week. His co-workers have no respect for him, his uptight stepfather is on his back and his beloved girlfriend Liz has had enough of his laziness and inconsideration. Really, Shaun isn't such a bad guy, but he has no ambition and seems to prefer the company of his unemployed, flatulent, video-game obsessed slob of a flatmate Ed to anyone else. And as if this were not enough, the dead have risen and are walking the earth in search of human flesh to feast upon. Shaun doesn't notice this fact as quick as he should, but Shaun is somewhat of a zombie himself, lost in his own world and distracted by his own thoughts as he strolls right past the rotting cadavers that now fill the streets of Britain. Not even news flashes can get through to Shaun, as (in an incredibly hysterical scene) he channel surfs rapidly, every station finishing the sentence of the one before and giving everyone but the oblivious Shaun the grim news of what is happening in the world. When Shaun and Ed finally do realize what is happening, it quickly becomes a race against time: save Shaun's mum, rescue Liz and go to the pub where they can wait out the zombie infestation with a pint and a smoke. <br/><br/>Of course, not everything goes as smoothly as planned. There's undead flatmates to deal with, \"bitey\" zombies along the way, petty arguments between friends and Ed's cell phone going off at inopportune moments. But Shaun, armed with a cricket bat, is determined to save the woman he loves and nothing is going to get in his way!<br/><br/>This film should be seen side by side with Romero's \"Dawn of the Dead\" as both films cleverly and sarcastically comment on our zombified society and virtually show no difference between the living and the living dead. There's not much gore here, but there is one very unexpected and Savini-worthy moment in \"Shaun\" when the zombies rip a living man to shreds, yanking out intestines and tearing off limbs. I really hadn't seen such a gory scene coming and was too stunned to look away. It's truly graphic and nauseating...and, though I usually hate gore, very well done. For a low budget film, the zombies are pretty menacing looking and there are some genuinely scary moments to be found in \"Shaun.\" There's also several touching scenes between Shaun and his mum and dad...sorry, I mean stepdad. Shaun himself is forced to grow up and take charge as the zombies close in around them. <br/><br/>I don't want to give away the incredible ending of \"Shaun\" except to say that the living dead are not immune from pop-culture commercialization, and though loved ones may die, video games are forever. <br/><br/>SEE THIS FILM!!! You do NOT have to be a fan of horror movies to appreciate the sublime satire that is \"Shaun of the Dead.\" I haven't seen a movie this good for a very long time. 10 stars.",
    "Adapted from an off-Broadway show, \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" is the end result of 6 years of character and idea evolution by creator John Cameron Mitchell.  Equal parts musical, mockumentary, and drama, the film pleases on all levels.<br/><br/>The film's musical numbers are brilliantly crafted and cross several different genres.  A country-flavored number, \"Sugar Daddy\", appears smack-dab in the middle of all the punk and glam rock tunes, daring anyone to doubt the soundtrack's variety.  The majority of the songs are catchy and great fun to listen to (\"Wig in a Box\" even has a karaoke sing-a-long during the second chorus), while staying true to the themes of the movie and Hedwig's life.  John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig) sings live vocals over a pre-recorded band mix, and this definitely lends more of a live concert feel than if he had simply lip-synched all the songs for the role.  The majority of the cast is reunited from the original cast of the \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" play, so fans of the original play who have not seen the movie need not worry about \"outsiders\" ruining it in transition.<br/><br/>The film's mockumentary nature mainly results from how the songs, being \"autobiographical\", are preceded by scenes of commentary by Hedwig and a flashback from her life.  While the transition from real time to flashback is usually made quite clear, some scenes (particularly the climax, which is a mess trying to piece together) are confusing as to what is real and what is flashback.  The rest of the mockumentary comes between musical sequences, during Hedwig's interaction with her manager, band, and showing of mixed feelings towards Tommy Gnosis, an ex-lover who stole all her material for his own album and is now a popular teen idol.  Her interactions with husband Yitzhak (who, due to an excellent make-up job and performance by original cast member Miriam Shor, I had no idea was played by a woman until I saw \"Like It or Not\", a documentary on the film included on the DVD)  would have made the list as well, had a vital character-development scene with Yitzhak (the only non-Hedwig flashback in the entire movie) been left in the final cut; as it is, Yitzhak serves only as Hedwig's back-up singer and whipping boy, a much less important character.  Most of the film's situations, however, are explained well, via flashback or dialogue, and have well-written gay and transsexual jokes.<br/><br/>Underneath all the humor and the music, however, is the serious theme of feeling spiritually \"whole\".  Hedwig seems to interpret this (through the song \"Origin of Love\" and some interesting animated vignettes) as through finding love and one's soul-mate.  Mitchell, who knows his character better than anyone, gives an amazing performance and is not only able to portray Hedwig's bitchy diva side, but also able to make the audience sympathize with why she acts that way (unlike real-life divas), and how deeply her inner feelings and her failures so far at \"becoming whole\" through a relationship trouble her.<br/><br/>Having not even the faintest idea of what the film was about other than that it was a musical, I was very pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had with Hedwig, and how at the same time it never strayed far from its serious theme.  In its journey from a character, to a play, to a movie, \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" has won over audiences as well as taken home accolades at Sundance, but has not had much mainstream success (chalk this up to its \"controversial\" transsexual main character and the popularity of \"Moulin Rouge!\", an experiment in stylistic over-extravagance, which is bigger and flashier than \"Hedwig\" due to its grand budget but lacks the sense of \"genuine\" emotion in the plot).  This is quite tragic, because in retrospect, \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" was definitely one of 2001's best films.",
    "Incredibly moving, yet definitely not for everyone, Hustle & Flow tells the story of D-Jay, an incredibly conflicted Memphis pimp down on his luck. In one of the most raw and intense performances of recent memory, newcomer Terrence Howard embodies D-Jay with an animal-like ferocity that will help you overcome what few formulaic clichés embody the script. In his mid forties, D-Jay seems too old and far too nice for his profession, and his \"hos\" seem to take notice. You see, D-Jay represents a lifetime of failed dreams, ambitions, and wrong turns. It seems as if it could all be over, but then fate offers him the opportunity to realize his life-long goal of becoming a successful rap star. D-Jay pours his heart and soul into his music, just as Howard pours his into the performance, and the result is somewhat of a urban Rocky, a true underdog tale. This is perhaps the first hip-hop film to actually get it right, and everything that 8-Mile should have been. Don't let the subject matter keep you from enjoying Howard's brutal tour-de-force.",
    "I'll be honest, I don't think any of the reviewers that have given this movie 10 stars have seen any episodes of the show pre-2000.<br/><br/>I went into the movie thinking it would probably be decent. I figured it would probably be in the style of the newer episodes but with better overall material. That's pretty much how it turned out. Anyone who says it was a return to the older *better* Simpsons is kidding themselves.<br/><br/>The Simpsons greatness was based, in my opinion, on two things: characters that we imagine existing in our society (think the comic book guy, Moe, Flanders) and simply hilarious and very quotable lines. This formula has since been replaced by humor that is situationally based, and quite frankly, just not very funny.<br/><br/>I saw this movie yesterday afternoon, and I can hardly think of one line that had me cracking up. There were some funny moments, yes, but nothing comparable to the brilliant one-liners from the show's glory years.",
    "Paul Newman reprised his role of Eddie Felson from \"The Hustler\" (1961), on all short lists of great movies, to star in \"The Color of Money\", a worthy sequel in the way \"Rocky II\" was to \"Rocky\" -- not a great movie, but very good.<br/><br/>Eddie, advancing in years, has apparently left the hustling circuit for a more respectable job as a liquor wholesalesman. On his route, he encounters a brash, obnoxious pool shark named Vincent (Tom Cruise) and his girlfriend (Mary Mastrantonio). Vincent has the talent, but not the brains or knowledge, to be another great hustler, so Eddie, his desire for the circuit reignited, offers to stake Vincent and teach him the ropes, in exchange for a substantial piece of the winnings. At first, Vincent's ego and obnoxiousness threaten his development, but he soon learns all of Eddie's tricks -- and a few of his own. By the time of the big tournament at the end of the movie, Eddie and Vince have split ways -- and find themselves on a collision course.<br/><br/>I just realized that \"The Color of Money\" is my favorite Tom Cruise movie, but not my favorite Paul Newman movie (which could well be \"The Hustler\"). I re-viewed this movie recently after a long discussion with some friends about the difference between a movie star and an actor, and the few living legends that are both (besides Newman, I'd include Jack Nicholson and Robert de Niro). As always, Newman, even with such a huge public persona, disappears into the role of the middle-aged grifter, heartbroken how far his game has fallen in the days since he left the pool hall circuit. But he also makes the other performers around him shine. Cruise's trademark cockiness shines through in Vincent. Besides Mastrantonio, one of my favorite actresses Helen Shaver turns in a nice performance as Eddie's girlfriend, and Forest Whitaker first appeared on my radar in his short time on screen.<br/><br/>The other star of the movie is the game. While Scorsese didn't make his movie into the character study of \"The Hustler\", he uses the pool tables and balls as a medium for many artistic scenes. If you are someone who enjoys looking at beautiful movies, you won't be disappointed. And there might even be some real pool players -- you never know...<br/><br/>The story is good, not great. \"The Color of Money\" is not cut from the same felt as \"The Hustler\", and does not try to be. It is a movie about pool, not a character study. I don't think I would be up to repeated viewings as frequent as \"The Hustler\", but it's a fine way to spend an evening watching Newman and Cruise shoot pool.",
    "Tommy Lee Jones & Will Smith give great performances, but it is not enough to grasp the attention of its audience as it fails to garner the touch from its predecessor. Men in Black II lacks the originality and goes excessively in too deep on its already familiar settlement.",
    "Underrated doesn't deserve the hate. Back to the Future Part III is so unappreciated. I keep hearing from people how bad this film is. Am I the only one who enjoyed this film? It is not a masterpiece like the first one is but it is a tied with the first one and it is a great sequel a great end to an excellent trilogy. Back to the Future is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I love the first film to death and it is a masterpiece and I love this (the third film) to death. Back to the Future Part III in my opinion it is tied with the first one and it is one of the best sequels of all time. It is my second favorite film in the trilogy in my opinion it is better than Part II I have enjoyed it more than Part II.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox , Christopher Lloyd and Mary Steenburgen are excellent at acting I have enjoyed their performances. Robert Zemeckis writes and directs excellent this sequel. Alan Silvestri writes a beautiful score for third film which it was shot back to back with the second film. I Love the new score for this movie. <br/><br/>Back to the Future Part III (1990)<br/><br/>I love that this film was set in the Old West back in 1885. I love the rescue mission in which Marty goes back in time from the year 1955 back in to the past in to the Old West to save his best friend Doc Brown from getting killed by an outlaw Buford Tannen. I love western movies and Marty McFly was naming him self as Clint Eastwood in this film which it was brilliant. They even make similarity from A Fistful of Dollars (one of my all time favorite western films) in which Marty wears a boiler plate as a bullet proof vest in which Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) shoots Marty. This movie has comedy, adventure, action, bank robbery, train robbery, gun fights, fist fights and one explosion. Great acting from the actors, great direction and great writing, great score. This movie shows group of Indians, followed closely by Cavalry men who are chasing them. Doc saves Marty just before he would be hang by Buford and his men. <br/><br/>I did like that the film was more focusing on Doc and Marty the characters that we care about. Rather then Loraine and Biff like Part II did. The movie wasn't dark like the second was. I love how Doc and Marty pushes the DeLorean along the spur line, on the tracks attempting to get it up to 88 miles per hour. DeLorean then reaches 88mph and disappears...with the locomotive barreling over the side of the ravine, and exploding in a huge fireball, brilliant and well done special effect. I love that the movie does not messes with the first two movies and it is an original film I appreciate that. <br/><br/>It is Rated PG for language, sensuality and violence. It is a perfect film from the 90's that I have grew up with it. It is my second favorite film in the trilogy I love, love this film to death and doesn't deserve the hate. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval a perfect score for me.",
    "I've been slowly making my way through Guillermo del Toro's catalogue of movies and this is my first time watching Hell Boy. If you're a Del Toro fan, then this one won't disappoint. He's such a superior director - he adds artistry to this action film through his use of shot making, pacing and colour. At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself.",
    "That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.<br/><br/>This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.<br/><br/>The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.<br/><br/>I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.<br/><br/>I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.<br/><br/>This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant \"hungry for more.\" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.<br/><br/>Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful.

    "I saw this movie on a fluke.I was standing on 42nd street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started passing out free tickets for a preview of this movie.I gave it a chance not expecting much.The promotional movie posters I've seen on the subway station walls do not give this film justice at all.<br/><br/>The movie is about a young rocker who goes on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metal.I'll leave it there.The movie is a heavy comedy and lot's of fun.If your are old enough to remember when Heavy Metal dominated the music scene in the eighties you are going to love this film.Jack Black is an amazingly talented comedian and actor and assuming he really wrote and performed the songs in this film he is also a talented musician.<br/><br/>Tenacious D is definitely worth a look!",
    "2012's Magic Mike wasn't exactly about the stripping. Sure, it features a lot of it, but the real center of the movie was the lifestyle of its main character, Mike. This latest installment showcases more of the crew and how they put up the show. It's more choreography driven than some commentary, which actually made it more appropriate to this material. It still has the stunning style of the first one, though it mostly feels quite forced, but if the movie tries to be itself, then there it actually shines. Magic Mike XXL indeed brings much of what you expect from it.<br/><br/>While the first movie basically shows the art of its aesthetics, this sequel rather shows the art of stripping. The story isn't quite remarkable; it's so simple that it's nothing more than an excuse to show more of these acts, which is both a good thing and otherwise. But really, that's what the target audience really came here for. Just like the first one, it's all atmosphere than following a plot. We just see these characters trying to get along, hint some commentary, and do some stripping. The difference however is the stripping is the real showcase, as in the direction and choreography improves within that aspect which makes these performances speak what this movie is truly about. People would immediately think that this would only appeal female viewers, but even as a straight man as I am, I would actually be impressed by the choreography displayed on those scenes.<br/><br/>The direction does try to keep Soderbergh's style going in this sequel, though only eschewing the intense sepia and welcoming other colors on the daylight. The new style is sometimes indefinite, specifically the vague lighting in some scenes, but then, the movie eventually breaks the pretense once the characters start dancing on screen, having more focus on their moves, and of course, bodies. Star, Channing Tatum, still has the charm as he always has. The other performers also get their characters expanded, staying natural whenever they bond and fight off on screen, treating them beyond than typical eye candy compared to the first one.<br/><br/>Many may call Magic Mike XXL a totally needless sequel or a cash grab for those who seek for more endless dose of shirtless men, but I believe this movie actually exists to make up for its own value. The story may not be as meaty as its predecessor's, but it shows everything what its audiences actually wanted for it. And it is done elegantly, proving that stripping apparently has more to offer than just lust for flesh. It sounds incredibly weird if you say it that way, but looking at these performances seems like this is an art that we didn't see coming. Again, there's nothing remarkable about the story, though if you're curious about the appeal of this career, then it gives a room for fascination.",
    "Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.<br/><br/>I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.<br/><br/>Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.<br/><br/>Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.<br/><br/>Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.<br/><br/>This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.<br/><br/>With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.<br/><br/>This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.<br/><br/>Masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Cast are great again<br/><br/>Charm returns<br/><br/>Excellent nostalgic soundtrack<br/><br/>Looks amazing<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Only one movie with Baby Groot?

    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>\nDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says \"Russell Crowe\", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a \"hunk\" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.<br/><br/>And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.<br/><br/>And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.<br/><br/>At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",
    "Ever wondered what it would be like to see Tom Cruise taking a break from his usual Sci-Fi & Impossible series \"avatar\". Well, here is your answer - It gets even more exciting and entertaining. This is Tom Cruise's real life take on the impossible series where Barry Seal replaces Ethan Hunt and CIA as the agency, which dictates the terms. It's just that Barry loves to go with the flow and without any intention of getting involved with anything that seems out of his league and this is something each one of us can relate to. He is your usual guy who happens to be a pilot and wants to make some extra cash with every extra mile. So what's wrong with it? Well nothing is wrong when you do it for the right guys, and nothing gets more exciting and dangerous when those right guys turn out to be CIA.<br/><br/>What is even more amusing and entertaining to watch is the fact that despite having no choice left but to cooperate with CIA, \"Barry Seal never says no\" to any offer (even if it comes from any drug lord) that helps him maintain his cash flow that obviously was becoming unmanageable for him by every passing day. Although, I must admit that it was quite a fun to watch him trying to manage millions of cash that he had no idea how to spend. <br/><br/>You will definitely enjoy watching Tom cruise as Barry Seal who uses CIA to get his end of the bargain (and they thought that they were the only smart guys who live in one of the greatest countries of the world).<br/><br/>If you want to go on an adventure trip, go watch this movie and you will understand what Tom Cruise really means when he says, \"I am just a gringo who always delivers\".",
    "Pier Paolo Pasolini, as is well known, was murdered not long after he finished work on this, his most audacious and confrontational film, yet even the most casual viewing of SALO begs the question - had he not been murdered, would he have taken his own life anyway? Every sequence, every shot and practically every moment of this film is so burdened with despair, barely concealed rage and a towering disgust with the human race, one gets the impression that Pasolini was barely hanging onto life - and any attendant shreds of hope - by his fingernails. Although ostensibly an adaptation of one of DeSade's most depraved works channeled through the horrifying excesses of the Second World War with the Fascist ruling classes as its (authentically vile) villains, SALO also contains a lot of contemporary criticism - Pasolini hated the modern world, and explained the stomach-churning 'banquet of s**t' as a none-too-subtle attack on the encroaching global domination of the fast food chains. (The scenes of sexual excess can similarly be read as a despairing attack on the permissive society - those who come to SALO expecting titillation or B-movie sleaze will be sorely disappointed.) Beyond the nihilistic content, which has been well documented elsewhere, the film has an overall mood that seems to have been engineered to make the viewer thoroughly depressed. Shot on washed-out, faded film stock using primarily static cameras, long shots, choppy editing and very few cutaways, SALO has a visual style reminiscent of cinema-verite documentary. Add to this the unnerving use of big band music, piano dirges and the (intentionally?) scrappy post-dubbed dialogue, and the distancing effect on the viewer is complete. SALO comes across as one long primal scream of rage, designed to shake the viewer out of his complacency, and in this respect, the film succeeds unequivocally. Whether or not you would care to watch this more than once, or indeed for 'entertainment', is another matter, but SALO is an important film that demands a careful viewing ONLY by those prepared for it.",
    "I'd have to say this is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago. I can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office. Apparently, a lot of people liked this movie.<br/><br/>A gorgeous color palette (man, this looks good) and a lot of good adult (but clean) humor make this a big winner. The opening 3-4-minute scene with \"Scat,\" is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him. \"Sid\" the sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the movie. He usually has something funny to say throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the big character of the film, literally, while Denis Leary is the ferocious bad-guy-turned-good sabertooth tiger<br/><br/>This isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice, sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters. This isn't interrupted with a lot of songs, either: one only brief one and there is nothing offensive, language-wise.<br/><br/>If more animated movies were this good, I'd own more.",
    "I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for \"colored\" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, \"Hidden Figures,\" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.<br/><br/>The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human \"computers\" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As \"colored\" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.<br/><br/>At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.<br/><br/>There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.",
    "The Silence of the Lambs is a timeless classic, whose more than adequate storytelling never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most entertaining but least fun films to watch all because of its disturbingly genius atmosphere.\nIt's masterfully acted, especially from Hopkins's side turning this film into a clever and unforgettable masterpiece. Even though Hopkins and Foster don't have much screentime together they still put on a show to remember. Aside from top of the line acting and the directing the script from Ted Tally's (based on the novel by Thomas Harris) is career-defining. From thriller to psychological horror, this movie handles the tone and atmosphere perfectly while switching between the two. In terms of being a psychological horror movie, it does it perfecting as it wraps itself around the viewers' head and proves that gore and blood aren't needed to scare an audience. Surprisingly (and deservedly) this film swooped all five major Oscar categories (Best actor, actress, director, screenplay and picture) even though it was released in February, a whole year before the academy awards.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable feat in film making and you be seen by everyone, a film lover or not. Shocking and suspenseful it is a thrill to behold.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10",
    "Thor is a film that takes risks - and they pay off wonderfully. The movie grounds itself in reality while keeping a mythological and fantasy-esqe tone, and it never loses sight of the humanity within the characters, with elevates this above standard superhero fare.",
    "On his first day at a new school, Cameron falls for Bianca Stratford. However not only is she popular and beautiful but her father has forbidden her to date until her older sister does too.  The problem is her sister, Kat, is negative, bad tempered and unfriendly and certainly undateable. Cameron seeks the services of school bad boy Pat who he arranges to be paid to date Kat and thus allow him to go out with Bianca - but things never go smoothly when it comes to love.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of teen comedies.  They mostly are lame, trading on the same old plots and clichés that have been around since Animal House and Porkies.  The recent trend has just seen classical texts adapted giving rise to some poor films like `She's all that'.  The plot for this is basically `The Taming of the Shrew' updated - most of it bares little resemblance to the play but that doesn't matter - the core is interesting enough to stand on it's own.  It may not surprise you in terms of who gets which girl and it's fairly predictable in a romantic comedy type way but that's not it.<br/><br/>No - the film is funny, lively and pretty enjoyable.  The comedy is built around the central plot with lots of nice touches and characters that are genuinely funny, such Mr Morgan and the erotic drama writing headmistress. The jokes happily never stoop to the gross-out type and this helps it feel fresh and lively, rather than just scrapping the bottom of the barrel.<br/><br/>Another strength is that the cast are all very likeable and give good performances all round.  Compared to the horror or Prince and Lillard in `She's all that' this was a dream cast.  Ledger is a real up and comer and he does well here - he doesn't over-egg his bad boy cake and his fall into love is believable.  Stiles is very cool and better than the teen roles she has had of late.  Here she rises above the `outsider' cliché given to her and does good work - again being a likeable and believable character.. Gordon-Levitt is OK but quite characterless compared to the main two roles, likewise Oleynik.  The bets roles are those on the edges and the three adult support roles really do well and are very funny -  Janney, Mitchell and especially Miller on good form.  Gabrielle Union is once again given a side role that doesn't play to her strength.  I like her and want to see her in bigger roles but here she is a `minority face' in a predominately white film, just as she was in She's All That - maybe I'm being a little paranoid but that's what it feels like.<br/><br/>Overall I was taken by surprise as to how funny and lively this film was. It didn't sink to the gross out comedy of so many teen movies and had characters and actors who brought spark and energy to the screen.  It may be predictable but it works and the jokes and side characters just add to the sense of fun.  Not brilliant but compared to the mediocre bunch of teen comedies you COULD watch, this is fantastic!",
    "Completely brilliant. This film is amazing in its characterization, its pacing, its character development and its visuals.\nThe book is superb, but Stanley is a genius who has a midas touch.<br/><br/>Glory glory violence.",
    "Please take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really write reviews, but I really felt compelled to say something about this movie and it's decaying genre.<br/><br/>I'm conflicted, because I know my opinion is getting more and more jaded with every new superhero flick- but I am quickly reaching the end of my rope here. All these movies feel so predictable and cliché anymore, and as much as I truly want to enjoy them it is becoming more and more difficult.<br/><br/>The main actors in this movie were pretty good, but what can you do with yet another weak story that has already been rehashed in other films. The writing felt subpar, and in the end it came off as being full of gimmicks and convenient sub plot.<br/><br/>It just doesn't feel real anymore, it doesn't feel believable. It feels like a fantasy world created for superfans who never take a step back and critique.<br/><br/>These superhero movies are becoming more and more uninspired, and while I try to give them all a chance I am just getting tired of it all. It feels like the quality is being diluted, all that matters anymore is the quantity. All that matters is the money.<br/><br/>I still hold out hope- just look at the 'zombie' genre. Just because there is dilution within the genre doesn't mean a sporadic gem can't be made. However, if you are of a similar mindset as me, you might want to keep looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!",
    "A great story of friendship and survival where an animal escapes from the zoo and his friends go to pick it up but everything goes wrong. The plot and their misadventures are quite original and the whole thing is rendered very well and generates great fun",
    "Blade Runner 2049 is a continuation of 1982's Blade Runner a seemingly impossible task. Against all odds and logic, the movie pulls it off.<br/><br/>The Good: The greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story. Without delving into spoiler territory Blade Runner 2049 concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises. There are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all. <br/><br/>The idea of keeping the cold war and old Iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless. Blade Runner 2049 does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today. It does not wink at the fears of today's audience. It is its own self-contained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago.<br/><br/>The acting is strong across the board with Harrison Ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film (and looking fit to boot). Also, Ana de Armas needs to be in every movie moving forward. A truly star-making turn.<br/><br/>\nThe Bad: A combination of a long running time, a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful. I confess a strong ending brought me back into the film It was losing me for a while there.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: This movie sticks to the ribs after viewing. It seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing (see leisurely pace above). Blade Runner 2049 pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films (Jared Leto). In many ways, it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be. A triumph.",
    "I was intrigued by the title so thought give it a go. disappointingly there were no special effects, explosions or alien monsters just a simple story relayed to us by actors of all things,because of all this it will not qualify for any awards other than my own lowly opinion.\nI laughed I cried, became angry and gave it the accolade of the best film I have seen for a long time, whatever tosh other people may say about this tale I enjoyed it, so lets have some more films with a story to tell without the bangs and bloodbaths",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "Screened overnite in Australia for critics and industry.<br/><br/>Ten minutes into director Bill Condon's adaptation of the hit musical, I whispered to my friend \"There's no way the film can go at this pace for two hours!\" Because up to that point, we had been utterly dazzled by breathtaking staging, impassioned performances and a display of film-making craftsmanship in all its forms (direction, editing, design) that had the packed audience stunned.<br/><br/>Well, two hours later, I'd been proved wrong. Condon has created a vivid, emotional spectacle that will dominate the 06/07 Oscar nominations. Dreamgirls is one of the five best movie musicals ever made.<br/><br/>There is really nothing new about the storyline - smalltown singers make it big and ride the roller-coaster of fame. But thats what works so well for the film - the great cinematic clichés are embraced and played to the hilt by a creative team, both behind and in front of the camera, that knows what makes a great Hollywood musical.<br/><br/>There's not one weak link in the cast. Condon's camera is in love with Beyonce Knowles and she handles the journey from the innocence of the groups early years to the staggering success and fortune of the group at its peak with surprising range. While most singer/actress attempts are failures (Madonna, Whitney, Britney, k.d. lang), Beyonce proves to have genuine talent.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx centres and grounds the film in a less-flashy role but one that is crucial to the films credibility.<br/><br/>But there are two standouts. Eddie Murphy as fading star Early has never done better work. And Jennifer Hudson delivers an absolute tour-de-force performance in a role that sees her dominate every scene she is in. Her belting solo number was applauded by the audience (a rare enough occurrence during an industry screening but a moment that was repeated a few times thru the film). Hudson is a lock for the supporting actress Oscar, even this far from the ceremony.<br/><br/>Dreamgirls is a better movie in every way than recent award winning musicals Chicago and Moulin Rouge (both of which I am a huge fan). It is a film that tells a classic rags-to-riches story utilising great cinematic technique and bravado. 2006 has offered up some great movie-going experiences for me (Thank You For Smoking, Children Of Men, V For Vendetta, Little Miss Sunshine); for the sheer cinematic thrill it provides, however, Dreamgirls proves to be the best two hours I've spent in a cinema this year.",
    "The saga of John du Pont is one of the more bizarre and tragic stories from the mid-1990s. In Bennett Miller's dark and ominous Foxcatcher, the episode is framed as a true-life Faustian Tale. But the story is almost secondary to three outstanding dramatic performances -- two of which are given by men who are better known for their work in other genres.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum stars as Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz. When we first meet him, he's already reached elite status by winning a gold medal. But the achievement hasn't allowed him to escape the shadow of his older brother, Dave, also a gold medalist. The younger Schultz wants more. He wants to be the best. His past prize also doesn't pay the bills. After training sessions, he's eating ramen noodles. All that changes, however, with a phone call from du Pont (Steve Carell) who offers to pay him and set him up in a first-class training facility on his Pennsylvania estate.<br/><br/>Like Schultz, the multi-millionaire du Pont is a man in a seemingly enviable position who nevertheless wants something greater. He has family issues of his own, as he strives to please his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave). He hopes he can make her proud by leading a team of wrestlers to gold in Seoul in 1988. But du Pont doesn't just want to be a benefactor. Even though he's little more than an extremely wealthy fan, with only a rudimentary knowledge of the sport, he wants to be seen as a coach and mentor to his wrestlers. And so, when Dave arrives to guide his brother, jealousy develops. Dave is everything du Pont wishes he could be, but isn't. He's a great teacher, a great leader. This leads to tension that slowly builds toward the story's shocking climax as du Pont's demons emerge.<br/><br/>As du Pont, Carell is almost unrecognizable beneath make-up and prosthetics. It's a quietly disturbing performance that will definitely have audiences and critics seeing the comic talent in a new light. Action/comedy star Tatum also has a breakthrough turn as the intense and driven young Schultz who grows increasingly uncomfortable under du Pont's subjugation. As a past Academy Award nominee, Mark Ruffalo's exceptional portrayal of the older Schultz comes as less of a surprise. But that doesn't make it any less notable or transformative. The normally wiry Ruffalo packed on a lot of muscle to play Dave Schultz. Here, he looks less like his Bruce Banner alter ego, and more like the Hulk himself. All three performances are a study in the art of subtly. This is a movie that derives drama from silent moments. In many key scenes, it's the words that aren't said that speak volumes.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher features themes of control and manipulation, and wrestling functions as an apt metaphor. It's that most primal of sports – one in which you literally bend another person to your will. Ultimately though, the movie is a story about two people who reach for greatness, only to experience a great fall. And it's also the tale of a great man caught in the middle. The saddest part is that it actually happened.",
    "Not much to say except I'm really annoyed by the critics sometimes. This movie is solid. Has a vintage old-time feel to it. Well acted. Deals with the problems of the times (racism, bullying, war, alcoholism, death) in a dramatic, humorous and clever way.<br/><br/>Great story. Whole family loved it. They dealt with faith in a reasonable way. They pulled heartstrings without being saccharine. The critics are just so dead-set on hating any movie that deals with faith, especially the Christian faith. This movie soft-pedals that faith - but it definitely is a strong element.<br/><br/>Wholeheartedly recommend this movie to families who want to be able to go out together for a movie, and be inspired and entertained at the same time.",
    "I was reluctant to see this movie. As a veteran of Desert Shield/Storm, I spent my first 90 days in-theater in the Weapons Co of A Swofford's Battalion. I later was moved to the 1st Bn of 7th Marines, but having been in the same unit for some of the same time I felt I could offer readers a unique perspective on the film's accuracy.<br/><br/>From a purely aesthetic perspective I thought the film was well done. The acting was very good, and the script was well written, witty, and accurate. The actors were well suited to their roles. My personal preference for a good plot would have been disappointed were it not for my personal interest in the film. In my opinion this film is an outstanding dramatic-documentary, so adjust your expectations accordingly. If you are expecting a driving plot line and all the accompanying dramatic tension, then I think you will be disappointed (as many whose comments I heard exiting the theater certainly were). But if you think of it as a chance to take a glimpse into a point in history, and see it as some of those who lived it did, then I think you will be impressed.<br/><br/>Many people may think that the obscenity of some of the interactions was overdone for effect. But whatever anyone's personal judgment of that behavior, that is the closest portrayal of Marines (or soldiers) being themselves I have yet seen on screen. Marines are vulgar. They do watch porn. They do fight among themselves. They do both hate, and love, the Marine Corps. There is an omni-present anti-war conspiracy theorist. The do say ridiculous things. There are some who are over the line. The reality of the Marine Infantry is that things happen there every day that are well beyond conventional sensibility, and which strain credibility to the average civilian. It's all true. I love the Marine Corps and I am still serving - I don't have an axe to grind. It just happens to be true.<br/><br/>Are there parts of the film that I find incredible? Yes. But they are not the essential things. There is a scene, it's even in the trailer, in which everyone is firing their weapon into the air. I wasn't there, but I can't fathom a breach of discipline on that scale. I can't say it's impossible, but I am doubtful. But whether it's true or not is not important. At its essence this is a film about Marines, how they adjusted to the Marine Corps, each other, and a war. If there are a few incredible details, then we can just be grateful that Hollywood didn't impose a car-chase on us.<br/><br/>This is a film about Marines. At that time, there were very few who turned down scholarships to Ivy League schools to come in. We were from strange backgrounds. We were obscene. We did want to get our kills. Many of us were frustrated that our war was only 100 hrs long. We knew we were filling the footsteps of giants - the Marines of Iwo, The Chosin, Belleau Wood - and I think we all wanted a chance to earn a place next to those men. In our wild, adrenalized youth, those aspirations just took the crude form of looking for a kill. Or at least that's how I've put it in perspective 15 years later.<br/><br/>If you go and see this film, try to recall yourself at 18 (as I was). Suspend your judgment of the obscenity and vulgarity until you're sure you would've done it differently. I can't speak for Swofford, but I am still incredibly proud of my service there. The insanity of this film reminds me why: because it is characteristic of the immense hardship that our youth bears on behalf of the rest. Do the characters look stressed? It's not hyperbole. We were 18 and we thought we were going to die over there. Still, at H-Hour, everyone marched North. In my opinion, you better fill some big shoes before you judge that. <br/><br/>So don't go into this film champing at the bit to pigeon-hole it as \"Anti\" or \"Pro\" war, with all the pre-fab rhetoric that comes with such a judgment. You have an opportunity here to look back into our little moment in history. Swofford has invited you into our memories. They are not Right, and they are not Left, they are just our story as Swofford lived it. If that kind of thing interests you, then go and see this movie.",
    "John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in an eerie hotel, naked and in the bathtub, with no memories and blood on his forehead. (I couldn't imagine a more strange and frightening experience.) The ring of the hotel phone breaks the silence-- a strange man on the other end tells him he must leave because there are people looking for him. Many events such as this one unfold in Dark City, where \"man has no past... and humanity has no future\".<br/><br/>Dark City has been passed over by so many critics it's depressing. I think that it should at least have been up for \"original screenplay\" or SOMETHING at the Oscars to reward Alex Proyas for his fantastic vision. I fail to see why so many people label this movie \"noir\" like it's BAD or something. Being dark and twisted is not a crime, and despite some other people's comments, this movie is NOT just for the trenchcoat-wearing masses (or if it is, maybe the rest of you can learn something from Goths). If you like sci-fi, dark plots and having reality be so well distorted that you don't realize it IS, so you will love Dark City. (People who have seen the Matrix BEFORE this movie MUST see it, it is very similar in these three respects).<br/><br/>I gave it a 9 out of 10 ONLY because I thought the ending fight scene was a bit weak. Great for a fight scene, but because the rest of the movie focuses on John Murdoch's quest to discover his past and the eerie, ominous happenings in the city, the climax seemed hastily thrown together, as if the crew all of a sudden remembered they had a deadline to meet and could no longer continue the plot in the previous fashion.<br/><br/>The visuals in this movie were absolutely stunning. The effects were NOT used to substitute for the plot, like other movies such as Starship Troopers, Lost in Space and Alien: Resurrection. They were used only as needed and were breathtaking. The editing is NOT as choppy as is rumored, it only lends to the power of the movie. There are some heart-stopping images in Dark City. Watch for the Strangers' clock, views of the city and John's memories.<br/><br/>Proyas takes ideas and ambience from many other movies but integrates them all neatly into Dark City. Gotham City is clearly seen as is Metropolis and other influences such as Ed Hopper's \"Nighthawks\" dominate in the diner scenes. The forty-ish era (yet strangely futuristic) city is known to be populated, and yet it is ominously empty (hence one of Hopper's main themes, isolation in large cities). (It's especially quiet at midnight, hehehehe... ;D ) This 40's era ambience together with the sci-fi fantasy undercurrent makes for a very interesting feeling while watching.<br/><br/>I'm happy that Kiefer Sutherland, Richard O'Brien (of Rocky Horror fame) and William Hurt agreed to do this movie, it gave Dark City just that much more validation in the USA (I wish things weren't like this, but they are). Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely wonderful and convincing as the doctor/scientist Dr.Schreber, and Rufus Sewell is a properly confused yet determined John Murdoch. Many critics say that William Hurt's character, the detective, and Jennifer Connelly's Emma Murdoch could have used a little more development, but I think part of the point of Dark City was that you don't really know who people are (not to mention yourself). Richard O'Brien and his character's whole race creep me out every time I see the movie, but he's especially frightening and a strange character. I had to resist the urge to talk like a Stranger after seeing the movie a few times.<br/><br/>Trevor Jones, one of my favorite movie composers, did the score for Dark City, and I must say it's very apropo. The deep, bass vocals and frantic themes are some of my favorite aspects, but \"Memories of Shell Beach\" is a haunting, beautiful song as well. Some of my other favorite scores by him are the Dark Crystal and Last of the Mohicans.<br/><br/>Altogether, I think Alex Proyas had a stroke of genius in the making of this movie. One of the most original dark sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time. It deserves its place with the Matrix, 12 Monkeys and others, pioneers in a field so changed (usually for the worse) since Star Wars and since earlier sci-fi classics. I hope these won't be the last of a (dare I say it?) dying race of movies that have true creativity and originality.",
    "The cultural references of Wayne's World may date it a bit, but the nature and personality of its humor set it apart. There is a kind of naive benevolence and boundless joy which makes this movie so lovable. Its aimless plot and exaggerated humor are cute, without ever transcending that barrier into maudlin sentiment. This is a difficult mix to achieve, especially when so many comedians go out of their way to achieve \"street credibility\" through as much forced vulgarity and stereotypical humor as possible. Campbell and Carvey's characters were the ultimate comedic anti-heroes for generation X, even more so than Jay and Silent Bob, Bill and Ted, or Beavis and Butthead. They championed amateurism, paraded self-affecting humor, and became worshiped for telling everyone they weren't worthy. If '60s pop culture encouraged people to \"do your own thing,\" Wayne and Garth were the genuine article in the '90s. Two complete geeks had fun acting as themselves, and became celebrated in the process. One of the true comedy classics of our time. 8.5/10",
    "After watching the rise of skywalker and the sequels as a whole, I thought It would be fitting to come back here and show the love it truly deserves!<br/><br/>Revenge of the sith is my favourite Star Wars movie, empire being the best. Obi-wan, anakin and palpatine all steal the show as George Lucas shows how to close but also open a trilogy with the perfect bridge of prequel to original trilogy! From jaw dropping lightsaber duels to great story telling it has it all! I really believe so many more will appreciate not only this movie but the prequels as a whole showing that the best way to make a Star Wars movie is originality!<br/><br/>Though at times the script can be clunky, it sure doesn't take away the drama that continues to build throughout the movie as anakin starts to sway deeper into the dark side! Palpatines mischievous yet cunning way of turning anakin to the dark side of the force (did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise?). It really is the perfect bridge as we see dark aspects of the Star Wars universe (order 66) and also the fan pleasing moments and references imply what is to come!<br/><br/>This is Star Wars!",
    "Having watched the film (more than once)i must say that i think that the person who wrote the comment \"A Stupid and Extremely Disappointing Movie\" is being silghtly childish. You cannot watch a film like Van Helsing with out taking it with a pinch of salt - it is a movie with vampires, werewolves and the frankenstine monster in at all at once for goodness sake. So you cannot go in to it thinking in a literal sense. You have to accept that it is not going to be some ground breaking epic and that it is just a bit of fun - but at the end of the day that doesn't matter, because if you go in with the right attitude and you enjoy it, then what does it matter that it is a bit \"off\" in places. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would definitely recommend it to any one who likes action/fantasy films and is up for a bit of fun!",
    "Personally, I've never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical fairytale. What a surreal idea for a movie! It's hard to find an adequate description (because I also don't want to spoil this in the slightest way) but this film has a sense of \"otherness\" to it - for lack of a better word - like none I've ever seen. And the strange, mythical nature of this film - apart from the amazing artwork - is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me. <br/><br/>Maybe the themes of the story don't feel quite as strange to an eastern audience because they fit to a certain degree with some eastern/Asian mythologies - to me, this beautiful piece of wonder was something new. And a profoundly moving experience. <br/><br/>Outstanding animation; funny, weird, scary and touching at the same time, this unique work of art is one I can't recommend enough. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "The first time I saw this film, I was suitably impressed but found I couldn't enjoy it completely.  In order to keep up with the relentless pace of the plot, I didn't pay as much attention to the writing and the performances as I should have.  When it was over, I felt the breakneck pace of the story overshadowed the screenplay and acting, rendering the film an accomplished reprisal of fact but not much else.<br/><br/>What a difference a second viewing made.  My familiarity with the plot allowed me to appreciate all the finer details of the film.   Watching Redford and Hoffman's disciplined performances as Woodward and Bernstein, for instance, is like watching two expert tennis players work in tandem with one another.  When they act together, there is a delightful give-and-take, two masters working their way into a wonderful groove.  While they appear steady and reserved on the surface, the two actors radiate a noticeable undercurrent of excitement and dread, as if underneath their stern countenances they're screaming, \"Holy sh*t!  I can't believe we're doing this!!\"  Redford, not the strongest dramatic actor, finds his normal-guy niche here and gives one of his best performances.  Hoffman is equally strong, making even the simplest scene seem like a masterpiece (the \"count to 10\" phone scene comes to mind).<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Pakula communicates the idea of these two reporters being completely outnumbered by the people responsible for the Watergate break-in.  I loved the numerous overhead shots of Woodward and Bernstein that pull up, up, up, until they're nothing more than specks in the dirty streets of DC.  (This technique is also used in the classic scene where the two guys are searching through old records and the camera pulls up to the ceiling and shows them seated along the edge of a circular series of desks.)<br/><br/>The film rockets right along, leaving the viewers as excited over the reporters' discoveries as they are.  William Goldman's script helps in this regard, I think, sticking straight to the meat and cutting out any unnecessary roughage.  The dialogue gets right down to business while working in realistic vocal habits and the like.  Redford really captures this well (listen to his stammering and self-corrections when he talks on the phone to sources - great stuff!).<br/><br/>I can't recommend \"All the President's Men\" enough.  It's tightly-structured, fiercely-paced, and captivating as all get-out.  If necessary, watch it twice: once to find out who's who, the second time to savour the handiwork.  If you want to talk more about it, leave a red flag on the potted plant on your balcony.",
    "(originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bug's Life was too much, too fast--he was \"dazed and exhausted\" by the visuals, and seemed to ignore the story completely)<br/><br/>Okay, first off, I'm 26 years old, have a job, go to school, and have a fiance'.  So maybe I'm nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being \"wowed\" by each frame visually.  How can you not empathize with Flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life?  \"Heck\" indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy. Of course, it's beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...).  Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!).  But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color.  No, A Bug's Life would be static if it were all that and no story.  But, I'm glad to say, it's not!  A Bug's Life has real heart.   Yes, there's a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them!  Just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think!  Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has.  This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing.  The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. It doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots.  Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not \"dumbing down\" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not.  All I can think is, if you can see A Bug's Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point.  Final words: A+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie); if you loved Toy Story you'll most likely love this (PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won't know what you're missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay?",
    "It may take two or three viewings to warm up to \"Beetlejuice\". It has a kooky, cockeyed sensibility and a rhythm that is by turns easy, lazy and frenetic. A charming couple in New England die and come back to their beloved home as ghosts, determined to rid the place of the horrendous new tenants. Possibly the most benign and engaging performance ever by Alec Baldwin; Geena Davis, Winona Ryder and Sylvia Sidney are also very appealing. The new couple from New York who take over the house (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara) aren't as well written or thought-out as the other characters and some of their bemused, dry-ice comic lines take a few seconds to reach you. Of course, there's Michael Keaton, wildly comic as Betelgeuse. I recall hearing comments back in 1988 that Keaton wasn't around enough to make the picture worthwhile, but that's only if you watch the film for the fast quips and sight-gags. Keaton is truly wonderful, but he's also bombastic, and I felt there was just enough of him to satisfy--it's really not his story anyway, it belongs to Baldwin and Davis; Betelgeuse is used as a horny, vulgar punchline. Director Tim Burton is very careful not to overload the movie with raunch; he is surprisingly careful in setting up this story, and he works magic within a dubious scenario: a comic fantasy about dead folks which ultimately celebrates life. ***1/2 from ****",
    "I wanted to like Wonder Woman, but I just can't get aboard the hype train. It's really the same as every other cartoonish, overblown comic-book action movie, except with a female protagonist.<br/><br/>Actually, this is worse than the average comic book movie, because it preaches to the audience about pacifism but then hypocritically celebrates \"heroic\" violence. In other words: Wonder Woman is an alleged pacifist who kills a bunch of people. Wonder Woman is also an alleged feminist, who allows Steve Trevor to drive the entire plot and basically steal the movie from her. Really, this thing is about as progressive as Dick Cheney's great-great grandfather.<br/><br/>I could forgive Wonder Woman's flimsy social commentary, if it were any good in other respects. But the plot is loose and shabby, the CGI is poor, and about half the scenes were shot in front of a green screen. Sometimes, I couldn't tell if I was watching a real movie, or Patty Jenkins playing God of War on her Playstation 2. (When exactly did cinema and video games blend into this horrible hybrid art form, which has none of the beauty and charm of old-school cinema?)<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the villains. The World War I era Germans are depicted as cartoonishly eeeevil, while the same era's British Empire is held up as a heroic ideal. Meanwhile, the main villain is a nightmare of bad CGI, who looks like he belongs on a 1980s heavy metal album cover. Naturally, they got a wonderful actor for this stupid part and wasted him entirely.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm going overboard on criticisms, but we need some balance to the rapturous praise this film has received. Movie fans often accuse professional critics of being too harsh, but lately, I think critics have actually become too lenient. Mainstream movies get dumber, louder and tackier all the time, and they are increasingly substituting mawkishness for real emotion and character development. And yet the critics have given this thing a great Rotten Tomatoes rating! I guess we've all lowered our standards to rock bottom?",
    "There can be little doubt that Cloud Atlas will become a classic that will be watched over and over again by its devoted followers, just like its predecessors by Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott. Despite the many questions I had in my mind when I left the theater and the moments during the film when I felt disappointed or confused, I knew this, and I have not stopped thinking about the movie and longing to be back in front of the screen.<br/><br/>It is easy to criticize this movie as some have done for being overly ambitious, pandering to low taste, being too simple or too complex, with too few actors or too many, or even for celebrating revenge violence against professional critics who write negative reviews. They may all be correct, but these critics will still put themselves in the same category as those that warned audiences against 2001 or Blade Runner. The truth is that Cloud Atlas is profound in its reach, its visual and acoustic impact, its mesmerizing flow and its completely ground-breaking storytelling, and movie goers will see it and feel it in their guts. <br/><br/>It is a movie that is a product of our age of internet-driven universal knowledge and vision, and the freedom we have to travel the world and jump between ages, genres, images and identities at our will. It reminds us that we are human and that we can still hear our heart beat, if we listen.",
    "I give this movie a 10 because it has a message. It has a true purpose to it, which effects nearly every man on the planet.<br/><br/>Ladies, you can listen to this, but be reasonable. Guys, we all masturbate. Some of us do it more than others, most of us look at porn. Some of us only masturbate to porn and some of us have real hard fetishes.<br/><br/>This movie points to the problem, the process of porn turning our heads, making us believe in perfection and making us ultimately selfish as lovers.<br/><br/>You watch porn, you don't have to please a woman, you don't have to worry about anyone but yourself. It is all perfect. In the real world, in relationships, the other person matters just as much as you, but sometimes, even the real thing is not as good as the fantasy and the ease of it.<br/><br/>Don Jon is about that confusion of liking and appreciating porn more than real women, of becoming addicted to the idea of 'perfection' and the ultimate realization of the effect it has on all us men, making us irritated little boys, incapable of truly connecting with another person.<br/><br/>The message is not that porn is bad, only the way we think and use it is misleading to reality.<br/><br/>But, this is not the type of movie to watch with the family, the girl; it's funny, but not a comedy in a spoof and clown type of way. Watch this movie alone, think about yourself and how porn effects you. It will benefit you greatly.",
    "Really, how to make something original, fresh and odd out of absolutely nothing except a few characters? Using characters, only characters and nothing except characters. That's the simple formula Brooks uses in all of his work, but, for me, he has never created so much charm, warmth and sensibility as he did in `As good as it gets'.<br/><br/>Characters write the screenplay in this movie, and everything that happens - happens because of what they are. They are nothing special Â– they are ordinary people we meet in the street every day and that have the same problems a lot of other people have. This movie presents the example of how much you can pull out of that. And if that is written as well as it is in this case, not even a happy ending can bother you. Because, in real life, shown here, what is the end?<br/><br/>Everything is good and warm in this movie, everything is fresh and vivacious, understandable and well performed. Jack Nicholson brings one of the best performances of his career, that terrific Helen Hunt finally got a chance to show how skilfully an actor can connect naturalism with the laws of the camera performance, and Greg Kinnear shows the most convincing emotions coming from a gay character I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The relationships between the characters are created in the way that you can't predict anything that's going to happen, eventhough you know in advance what could come out of their mouth and what kind of attitude they'll have in a certain situation.<br/><br/>You can simply feel the progressive collaboration that occurred between Brooks and the actors and the mutual understanding they developed, and it's not often that you see that kind of artistic superstructure shining on the screen so much as it does here.<br/><br/>I find `As good as it gets' complexed, vital, intelligent, emotionally deep and studied, fresh, original, amusing, cheerful, funny, and one of the best films of 1997.",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "There aren't many animated Disney films I don't like, basically every single one of them until the end of the seventies was amazing. But for me, this is the one which stands out. <br/><br/>Sadly, Disney himself never got to see the finished film (he died during the production), but this is one he would have been proud of. Crafted beautifully and with attention to every little detail, from the way the different animal species move to the colorful jungle backgrounds. <br/><br/>Wolfgang Reitherman has directed some of the studio's best - but here he has created his masterpiece. Outstanding animation, fantastic characters - and what a killer soundtrack.<br/><br/>A joy for every generation to discover anew (my 9-year old nephew currently has a bit of a Shere Khan fixation), I guess I will never outgrow this timeless classic. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",
    "This is about as scary as I want to movie to be. I genuinely jumped a few times watching this and once or twice muted the sound. Which makes me laugh writing it, but trust me, there are scenes in this film that challenge the old ticker. A cardboard box in the hallway comes to mind. Those who've seen the film will know what I mean. I particularly liked the use of the found footage in this movie. It was very well integrated into the overall film and extremely disturbing. There is definite potential to make a sequel to this, as the story is set up to have a new chapter. I'd watch it during the day next time. Highly recommended for jump-scare horror fans.",
    "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) is a classic phenomenal arguably the best sci-fi film in trilogy away, the one that started all and arguably changed the face of cinema forever. I love this film is actually my number 1 favorite film in the franchise and it is George Lucas masterpiece - the man who make this film happening. He wrote and Directed him self, I love this film to death! I love everything that is in A New Hope. Before I go in to this movie I want to say after watching the new awful horrible movie Episode VII The Force Awakens, I decide to re watch the original Star Wars Trilogy and I have always loved A New Hope and I always will. This was the first film in the trilogy that I have saw as a kid and that I remember. Star Wars are starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.<br/><br/>The plot is actually more about Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. It is a mission returning the plans of Death Star to the Rebel Alliance, while Galactic Empire want's them back and it is lead by Darth Vader (David Prowse). This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and Special Effects.<br/><br/>Star Wars is a film that I have watch it now and I will always watch it , because how much I really, really enjoy this film. This fun, pure joy, entertaining and truly a great film is like a classic, I recommend this film to any fan of the Star Wars trilogy, my favorite will always be A New Hope. This was the film that I have saw the first time as a kid and it grow on me. I love introduction when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking trough the desert on planet Tatooine and are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. Here is the first time we met the character Luke Skywalker. This is the scene where C-3PO is walking trough the desert him self and than he saw someone far away and yells for help. I love this scene and it is the scene I remember from childhood.<br/><br/>Which is your favorite character? My favorite character of all time is Luke Skywalker and I really love him so much. My second favorite character will be Han Solo but Luke Skywalker will be the ultimate hero of the galaxy for me.<br/><br/>I love this flick, I love the end battle on Death Star, Luke joins the Rebel assault squadron and Luke becomes one of the few surviving pilots. Vader leads a squad of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Luke's X-wing fighter, but Han returns and fires on the Imperials, sending Vader spiraling away. Helped by guidance from Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke uses the Force and successfully destroys the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the Rebel base. I love that scene.<br/><br/>I love John Williams score for Star wars which is the best score ever! It is an excellent score makes an actions scenes more exciting and more intense. George Lucas directed this movie well and did an excellent job been a writer as the same time been the director, the pacing is excellent the actors does an awesome job. I also love and I have enjoyed the character Darth Vader and I also love this film because it has a happy ending. Harrison Ford , Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher did all a great joy playing their characters.<br/><br/>Carrie Fisher is really gorgeous in this film and for the 70's film it had great pacing and great imaginary story that dose not gives you only a snippet of the backstory. The fight scene between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi was excellent and the death scene of Obi-Wan was a honorable death. Alec Guinness did a perfect job as Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi he is excellent. <br/><br/>Overall: I have said everything about this film that I love I forgot to mention I love Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker (I love to death), Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2. This flick get's a perfect 10 because it is the best beloved science fiction film.<br/><br/>R.I.P. Carrie Fisher (1956 - 2016) she was the perfect Princess Leia and she is very missed.",
    "This movie is so real..at least to this person, who lived these things that happened in the movie. I will tell a short version of my personal life to let you know how it affected me from my own experience of growing up in the Thirties<br/><br/>I think their must have been more then one car because ours was full of stuff in the back seat, clear up almost to the roof. Frankie, Bill and me (my brothers) all was on top of the stuff in the back seat, had to stay lying down was not enough room to set up. What I remember most about the trip was it was awful hot when we went through Arizona and we had not much water, the water we had was in a canvas bag, hooked to the front bumper to help keep it cool. We did not get much because dad was saving it for the car when the car got to hot. Mom told us to suck on pebbles, and we did. It was a bad time every where. No jobs or anyway to make any money. <br/><br/>We were going to California because their was suppose to be some picking work their, after we got to California we saw miles of potatoes all loose piled up high my guess would be about six feet high, they had put lime or something that looked like lime it was a white powder to keep people from taking them to eat.<br/><br/>We found a place to pick plums that they used to make prunes and we lived in a Quonset hut made of corrugated metal setting on a concrete slab. The public toilets were near were we stayed, Joe and his wife (Family friends)had their own Hutthis was the time that dad & Joe would sell tickets for people to watch them box each other in a ring at the recreation hall on the property. Also they joined a baseball team and played baseball, dad played left field. We got to watch them play for free.<br/><br/>Seems like Frankie and I played together a lot don't think Bill did because he was still a baby his self, Doris and Dorothy (my sisters) was still crawling so Bill could not have been very old at that time. Frank & I would go pick up plums off the ground and we would bring them home, Doris and Dorothy would set in the box and eat them. You can guess what they would look like when mom and dad got home, their was no air condition back then so they would take a hose and squirt water on the tin Quonset hut to try and cool it off some, I know when we went west we looked like those grapes of wrath folks in the movie.<br/><br/>That area was the first time I ever saw a frog walk, it was to hot for them to hop, when they tried to hop their bellies would touch the ground ( gravel) and would burn them, any way that's what we thought at that time. I saw the movie of Grapes of wrath a long time ago, and I remember it so well, I cried most of the time it was on because it reminded me of the hard time we all had back then, I was born in Oklahoma and it was just a terrible time in the late thirties I would love to see the movie again, its to me a history of my family, I am 71 1/2 years old now and still remember it very clearly.<br/><br/>Gene McDaniel",
    "Much has already been written about Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto's astonishing transformations, and brilliant performances. Solid and true, yes. They both deserve enormous accolades, Golden Globe and AMPAS-worthy, for these transformations and the effort of their craft. But I think the true heroes of this project are the Producers who took a chance on such dicey subject matter. Some reviews hail the project as \"A Crowd Pleaser,\" and yet, you realise, these are TRULY marginal characters, and not entirely likable, as some have already said, in an Era (1970s-1980s early AIDS crisis) that is nearly forgotten in this age of HIV exposure-as-a-managed-care-condition, rather than a death sentence, as it was between 1979-1995. As much as this could be a feel-good film for the discovery and pioneer of protease inhibitor cocktails, it is a compelling character study of a time of crisis that has not been well-captured or documented adequately in quite some time. BRAVO to the Producers of this movie for giving this project the Greenlight, because the sexually-active youth of today would never know the Plague and tragedy that preceded their coming-of-age without a reminder like this.",
    "Nightmare Before Christmas is such a classic movie that will always hold a special place in my heart, even if the new emo generation is claiming hold of it, they do realize that this film was made years before, right? Moving on, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a wonderful and charming movie that is original, funny, and moving. I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.<br/><br/>Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to \"Christmas Town\". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Christmas Eve he begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts: shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, only terrify the recipients. Realizing what damage he did Jack attempts to fix what he has done, but has to make sure to make Santa safe and happy again.<br/><br/>People who do not enjoy this movie, I don't understand how you could not honestly. It's such a charming movie and very unforgettable, I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the theater in 1995, I still watch it every year for Halloween and even Christmas. My sister and I are grown women, but if I slip in the soundtrack, we become kids again and start singing to The Boogey Song. I do admit that Spencer's Gifts and Hot Topic have over blown on the Nightmare Before Christmas memorabilia, but everyone wants something from this movie because it's just that memorable and you can't help but fall in love with it. It's positively magical, Jack Skeleton is awesome and can steal any holiday any time, I loved his ideas personally, Easter is next! <br/><br/>10/10",
    "This is not a movie about a rock star with their music simply part of the facts of the story. It is a musical in the truest sense, that uses his own music to show his tribulations through the eyes of a man during the troubled years of his life. The movie is not always chronological and in some cases is more figurative than historical. In this way it can convey Sir Elton John's life and struggles in a way that the viewer may understand on a more personal level. The acting, writing and singing are superb.\nThe star did not try to truly imitate Elton but instead preforned the pieces in his own style that he molded as closely as possible to the original. It sounds odd, but it works.\nAs always you can never sum up any life, book or story in a 2 or so hour movie, but this comes close. You leave feeling like you really got to know the real, yet flawed, human Elton John. Overall a wonderful movie.",
    "There's a lot of anxiety that goes into viewing The Exorcist, \"the scariest movie ever made\", for the very first time. And with that anxiety comes a lot of expectations and preconceived ideas about what The Exorcist *should* be. Especially for someone born after the film. Then on top of that waited years before finally seeing it.<br/><br/>I love the Exorcist, and after exposure to God knows how many horror films, the Exorcist remains my favorite within the genre. And even from a die-hard fan I have to admit, I hate hearing \"scariest movie of all time\" associated with this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, there's no reason to compare fright factor of films, so forget that anyone ever called The Exorcist \"the scariest movie ever made.\" Take any movie  I don't care what movie  and stick a \"greatest/scariest/best\" whatever tag next to it, and you'll have audiences investing in what they *think* it should be instead of letting the film present itself for what it is. And all they see is that it is not what they expected (expectations, I might add, that are shaped by the current gimmicks and trends in Hollywood).<br/><br/>I love the Exorcist because it dared to defy my expectations. This is not a wall-to-wall, credits-to-credits montage of scary imagery inspired by a mere scenario that's supposed to pass as a plot. This isn't a movie about that long dark corridor and something waiting to jump out of the darkness and attack (which is always preceded by a false scare featuring a cat). It's not about that cheap gimmicky scenario of X amount of people isolated from the rest of the world, with a killer/monster/ghost/whatever on the loose.<br/><br/>The Exorcist is a very slow movie that actually features a full blown plot, its characters, and their associated arcs. The original ambition of The Exorcist was to scare the world with imagery and concepts never before seen in cinema. Shocking moments that the audience of 1973 could not believe they would ever see on the silver screen (from a major studio, no less.) After 30 years, the movie isn't so shocking because times have changed, and the success of the Exorcist has guaranteed countless imitation in all forms across all boards. However, the Exorcist is still one of the most ambition horror films ever made, because (are you ready for this?)  the Exorcist dares to tell a story.<br/><br/>Everyone remembers the pea soup, the head spinning, the vulgarities spewed from the demon's mouth, the stairs, the infamous cut (now restored) spider walk. But I adore this movie for the things no one seems to bring up  I love the setup in Iraq where Father Lancaster Merrin detects the signs of his final showdown, and how these abstract scenes on subsequent viewings give the movie a more epic feel. I love the transition from Chris MacNeil to Father Karras walking across campus that's reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock. I became absorbed watching Father Karras caring for his aging mother and the close relationship they have, seeing him depressed and sharing a drink with a fellow priest as he discusses his own issues with faith.<br/><br/>And what impresses me most about a movie named the Exorcist is how it seems to reject the possibility of possession and exorcism as its ultimate and final solution. The characters in the movie don't want it to be true, and in fact don't really even know about the possibility of Exorcism, thus they explore and exhaust all other possibilities (both medical and psychological). I smiled with delight (after all the hospital scenes) in that priceless moment when Chris MacNeil asks Karras, \"And how does one go about getting an exorcism?\" which stops father Karras in his tracks as he, a man of the church, looks at her as though she's lost her mind.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie resists the temptation to jump right into the acknowledgment that Regan is possessed continues to build up the epic Good versus Evil, God versus Satan, the exorcist versus the demon, feel. Like the characters, the movie doesn't want it to be true, it doesn't want to go there and embrace that possibility, but we the audience know what must inevitably happen. And it's almost magical how the movie finally acknowledges Regan's only hope. There's no glorious fanfare nor is there boastful ultimatums, instead the movie lamentingly and silently surrenders to it as we watch Lancaster Merrin walking up the sunny garden path, staring down at a newly delivered envelope. He doesn't have to read it. He already knows what it says, as do we.<br/><br/>The imagery then fades to an ominous foggy night as a taxi pulls up to the MacNeil place in Georgetown, then we're treated to the haunting imagery that inspired the cover art. What must be done, must be done. I love how the movie implies that Merrin has faced this very demon before through its imagery, and through the dialogue as Karras explains he's identified at least three manifestations to which Merrin answers, \"No. There is only one.\" I can address more  the acting, the beautiful cinematography, brilliant makeup  but I'll stop to keep from sounding like a raving fan who over hypes every inch of everything. I'll close with these thoughts: I'm not the type of person who will watch the same movie over and over and over. Most movies I see, the specific imagery and specific ideas don't make a deep enough impression to stick with me for more than a few months. I remember the Exorcist, not because I thought it was the \"scariest movie ever made\", rather because of the wonderful craftsmanship, the fact that it dared to tell a story, and it defied my expectations.<br/><br/>When Friday the 13th, the Grudge, Skeleton Key, and Cursed are reduced to vague memories and general ideas, I will still clearly remember the Exorcist.",
    "This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CGI.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters (1984) is the best classic original spectacular supernatural masterpiece from Ivan Reitman! One of if not the greatest films ever! My favorite film of all time! \"Ghostbusters\" is the film that made me become a fan ever since I was young! It had an awesome cast, cool special effects, hilarious dialogue and a kick-ass soundtrack! The film that can be watched over and over again! I grew up watching Ghostbusters on TV and the animated TV series The Real Ghostbusters (1986 - 1991). Ghostbusters II (1989) actually introduced me in to Ghostbusters. I loved them so much that I even said to my mom, when I grown up I will be a Ghostbuster! It was my fantasy. Watching it yesterday and I still love it. I love this flick to death! I still can't believe it how the world changed and how in the 80's the world was better than today! I always have enjoyed the sequel much better than as a child, it was my first movie but now as an adult, I love and enjoy the original movie to death! It is the only movie I own on Blu-ray disc and I still love it. <br/><br/>This is an amazing movie! Funny, smart, well written and directed. It features an outstanding performance from Bill Murray, great showings by Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis and one of the last documented instances of Dan Aykroyd being funny on film (he was blown by a ghost!). In fact, the film gets a great performances from nearly everyone who appears in it- from Annie Potts, to the guy who played Lenny the Mayor, to the handsome cab driver who calls Rick Moranis an asshole. In addition, they had one of the best \"a-hole\" guys ever to appear on film, as the film's bad guy- I'm talking of course of the grossly under-rated William Atherton- who played the EPA guy, \"Dickless\". Atherton, of course went on to play memorable a-holes in Real Genius and of course he was the annoying reporter in Die Hard (1988) but here in Ghostbusters, you really see a solid performance by maybe the best guy to play an a-hole in films in the 80's. <br/><br/>Next Year the reboot is coming out as Paul Feig's Ghostsnuters, Ghostbitches or Ghostflufers./: Ghostbusters (2016) with women now as a Ghostbusters! Why rebooting this awesome supernatural spectacular comedy flick? I know the sequel failed and Bill Murray did not want anything to do with it. But that doesn't mean that they shouldn't have made Ghostbusters III in the 90's, they should have! Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis tried so hard to convince Bill Murray to do it for the third sequel and they couldn't convinced him. They are going to ruin the Original movie! I don't want to see Ghostbusters with a female leads. Come on? The girls are not the Ghostbusters, they are three man a scientists and a one civilian. The Ghostbusters are the only one Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Bill Murray. They were always be the Ghostbusters that will be the case. No one else will be! No one else will replace them! This is like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) that come out the same year as the Ghostbusters did, they remake it and that remake failed!! It was awful boring! Why remaking or rebooting my classic horror comedy's that I Love?! Ghostbusters (1984) are unique, classic 80's masterpiece! These were the best times for movies ever!!! One of my favorite soundtracks and movie of all time!<br/><br/>They just don't make them like this anymore. This is comedic writing and performance at its peak... with quotes that everyone knows and enjoys. From \"This reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head\" to \"Symmetrical book stacking. Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947\" to \"Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you! \" this is a CLASSIC movie! Ghostbusters is a true classic comedy that stands the test of time. The film is funny, awesome and entertaining. It has a lot of laughs. I love the soundtrack Ghostbusters Written and Performed by Ray Parker Jr. I think he did made a great soundtrack in the 80's. If there's something strange in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!!!! A film that can be watched with the various youngest to the very oldest of the family. Wonderful collection of characters. A film that is treasured by just about everyone that watches it. I miss movies from the 80's and this film felt so realistic. Sigourney Weaver was just so outstanding as Dana Barrett after she made the horror flick Alien (1979 and Aliens (1986). <br/><br/>Ghostbusters is a 1984 American supernatural comedy film, directed and produced by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. The film stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. <br/><br/>10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Columbia Pictures, Black Rhino Delphi Productions Starring: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, William Atherton, Ernie Hudson Director: Ivan Reitman Producer: Ivan Reitman Screenplay: Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis Rated: PG Running Time: 1 Hrs. 45 Mins.

    "For Love Of The Game<br/><br/>Maybe I'm looking at this film through rose colored glasses. Sam Raimi is one of my favorite directors, a real talent with visual ingenuity and a penchant for silliness. With last holiday's bleak A SIMPLE PLAN, Raimi gave up his EVIL DEAD past and churned out the most satisfying dramatic thriller of last year. He is certainly growing by leaps and bounds as a storyteller, and his latest film, FOR LOVE OF THE GAME, is another surprise for those of us who are fans. A truly elegant, dashingly romantic, white-knuckled look at baseball and matters of the human heart, GAME represents what a true Hollywood soap opera should be, effective.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner plays Billy Chapel, an aging pitcher for the Detroit Tigers heading for the mound for may be his last time ever. The team owner has sold the organization to a corporation and they have plans to trade Billy. His arm continues to fail him more every time he steps up to thrown. And to top it all off, Billy must deal with his tempestuous relationship with Jane, a woman he met by a broken down car on the side of the road five years ago and has yet to fully commit to. With all these thoughts swirling inside Billy's head, he unknowingly begins pitching a perfect game. Unable to keep his mind clear, Billy thinks back on his life during the game and considers the mistakes he has made and the people he has met.<br/><br/>Told mostly in flashback, LOVE OF THE GAME is first and foremost a baseball movie. While being knocked for his recent professional choices (yeah, I liked THE POSTMAN, say what you will) Kevin Costner seems to have been crowned king of the baseball flicks. Ron Shelton's BULL DURHAM is pure genius, the best baseball film ever. FIELD OF DREAMS is more like GAME, both share a strong heartbeat and retaining a smart enthusiasm for the sport. Costner has been the glue that held both films together. He's always been a good actor, only reaching brilliance once (DURHAM). He has the rare charm the many actors forget to consider. While not technically proficient, Costner knows screen charisma well. GAME gives us a desperate Costner performance, one which lets the actor take his guard down for once. His Billy Chapel is a man used to success, yet unsure how to use it to his advantage. A man who can hardly imagine himself consumed by anything but baseball. It's a great performance from Costner. My only hope is that public opinion doesn't tarnish the acting for the paying crowd.<br/><br/>Kelly Preston has the more troublesome task of shining brighter than Costner. A working actress for sometime now, this new film feels like the first time Preston is really acting. I enjoyed her supporting work in 1998's underrated JACK FROST, and GAME finally puts her front and center. She bounces effortlessly of Costner, and the two - while skittish at first - melt into a nice chemistry that packs more emotion than I expected. The loopy John C. Reilly (BOOGIE NIGHTS) and Jena Malone (STEPMOM) are also quite pleasant in small roles.<br/><br/>Working with even more restraint than his SIMPLE PLAN, Raimi brings to the table his gift for camera placement and visual tenacity. The baseball scenes in GAME are very romantic, the title doesn't lie. A self-professed fanatic of baseball, Raimi's love of the game shows in each shot. With noted cinematographer John Bailey, the two create a pristine looking film. The stadium scenes are both frightening cinematic and realistic at the same time. The look of the film might not register with many people, but I couldn't help but to admire such attention to detail.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Dana Stevens made quite an impression with her spare and warm CITY OF ANGELS remake. What she brings to GAME is the feeling of courtship that I enjoyed in Costner's last film MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE. Costner and Preston really show the genesis of a relationship, warts and all. The structure of flashback that Stevens uses to tell the story isn't as unfortunate as it sounds. It's all a rather nice mix of familiar baseball melodrama and a hearty dose of Hollywood soap opera. Stevens proves once again that she has a wonderful ear for romantic entanglements.<br/><br/>Call me a sucker for the obvious, but FOR LOVE OF THE GAME really worked for me. I really was moved by the story and enjoyed all the nuances and quirks. This classy film might not have a hero with a chainsaw for a hand, a crispy scientist with a reliance on synthetic skin, or a quickdrawing Sharon Stone. What it does have is strong emotional resonance. A audience film that the mainstream will love and the arthouse will abhor. I'll take that any day.-------- 10/10",
    "It seems this movie has taken a bit of heat, known by many as Shyamalan's \"worst\" film. It is often written off as slow moving, and the twist at the end as unoriginal and boring. I've heard people say the acting and camera work was awkward and stale and that the casting was poor. Ironically enough, as more people begin to dislike this movie, the more I seem to fall in love with it. This film has a lot of personal bearing with me, both as a student of psychology and a lover of movies and just plain art. I feel like I've taken this film under my wing during its times of criticism, and now I'd like to try and show everyone what exactly I love about it so much. <br/><br/>Shyamalan really showed a stroke of brilliance by getting Serra to be his cinematographer and to play around with the aestetics of the film. I don't know how or where Shyamalan is getting these guys for his movies, but I definitely love the style of each frame he shells out. Serra had been involved with predominately foreign films before Unbreakable. This was his first big American film, and I think you gotta give a little credit to Shyamalan for that. His unique and creative touch really added to the direction. In keeping with the \"comic book\" theme of the movie, you will notice that almost every shot is taken as if you are looking through or in between something. Like the squares of a comic strip. There is also a dark, slightly blue colored filter used throughout most of the film. This gives the movie a very bold, but eerie tone. Showing that the world can be a rough and scary place, but it can also be fought and overcome. It is evident that time and effort went into every shot. It may not slap many viewers in the face as brilliant, but it really strikes a chord with me. <br/><br/>As for the score, I am more than willing to argue that this is, hands down, James Newton Howard's best score of his very successful career. It is compelling and booming. It's very powerful, but not over-the-top and excessive. For anyone with the soundtrack, check out 'The Orange Man' and 'Visions'. These are two of the most powerful pieces of any film score around. And I stress the word \"powerful\". Yeah, he's no Hermann or Morricone, but the emotional weight and emotive power of his chords and his overall composition are just downright chilling. <br/><br/>The writing and the direction are just as captivating as the score. Almost every line of dialogue and every scene seems to be placed out on an island, alone so that everyone can stop and judge it. Some people might view this as cocky and/or boring direction, but I see it as daring and unique. Much of Shyamalan's writing is done that way. ('…I see dead people…' '...They call me Mr. Glass…' etc. etc.) Another aspect of the film that tickles my fancy is the underlying themes. I do believe, to a certain extent, that people do have somewhat supernatural powers at times. People have been known to make miracles and do unbelievable things. Maybe these things could be 'developed' in some way. These theories are, in a way, intertwined with some aspects of psychology, such as selective attention and self-actualization. If you care to discuss some of these ideas, let me know and I will relate them to the film through my eyes. In short, I do believe there is a superhero in everyone. It may not be through supernatural powers, but it may simply be through the act of reaching out to a person in need. Other themes of the movie, like how completely different people can always be connected in some way and how everyone has their vulnerabilities and weaknesses are intriguing, yet universal. From a psychological point of view, Shyamalan really gets inside the head of OI patients (osteogenesis imperfecta). He then brings this psyche to the next level with Jackson's character. Elijah, is very passionate but very tortured and evil. His interactions with Willis bring depth and focus to both the characters and the story. Certain scenes in the movie are really quite striking and powerful. The shots of Willis in his security poncho. The train station scene. Elijah's breathtaking fall on the stairs and many more speak so loudly to me and say so much in just a simple clip. For some reason this movie just speaks to me, like art. If anyone cares to discuss more about this film, that'd be cool. There is a lotta other cool stuff to talk about with this movie. Just thinking about it makes me want to watch it a few more times. It may not be the feel good film of the year, or the masterpiece that everyone was looking for, but it definitely sits well with me.",
    "This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review for on IMDb. There are only a few movies in history that have impacted me as much.<br/><br/>The first time I saw Inside Llewyn Davis, it left me feeling empty and confused. While I appreciated the music, the acting, and the cinematography, I couldn't understand why anyone would love this movie (and I am a huge Coen fan). After all, it's just scene after scene of a jerk getting beaten up by life with no real plot progression and no real reason to care about any of the characters.<br/><br/>I then came across the movie again on TV and decided to give it another chance.<br/><br/>After this second viewing, the movie's themes connected with me in a big way. After my third and fourth viewing, it shook me to my core.<br/><br/>This movie is almost too realistic. It follows none of the conventional \"rules\" and there is no winner or hero. There's no real drama. There's no \"silver lining\". There's only struggle. And then acceptance.<br/><br/>For every one Bob Dylan there are myriad Llewyn Davis'. Really talented musicians and artists that work really hard and simply don't catch the lucky break. People go under the radar, under-appreciated and overlooked. People that never make it big and therefore question whether they should be doing it at all.<br/><br/>This is a film for the everyday folk; a beautiful empathetic look at art, music, and everyday struggle.",
    "Hitchcock at his sharpest. Art and commerce in a delicious salad with all the right ingredients. A brisk screenplay by Ernest Lehman a Cary Grant that is just pure delight, Eva Marie Saint fresh out of her Oscar from \"On the Waterfront\" is an icy blonde with a brain. James Mason, the ultimate foreign sinister not to mention Jessie Royce Landis and Hitchcock brings Bernard Herrmann to wrap it all up in one of the most infectious scores imaginable. A real treat.",
    "This movie I know people did not really enjoy. But in a way it is underrated. Because it does really get Mickey back in the show (which Rocky IV stayed away from). I got sad towards the beginning when Rocky goes back to the old neighborhood one night and goes to Mickey's gym and at the end when Rocky is thinking back to what Mickey was telling him in the first two. It also really does have a father son theme in it. I felt sorry for his son. Tommy Morrison did a good job in playing his character. All the Rocky movies to me are the same because they all have there specialties. So yea in a way this movie is underrated and actually really sad.",
    "I have only ever seen this film once, I only ever want to see this film once and I will only ever need to see this film once. It is etched on my mind. I, like many others, left in silence.  I could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film, picking small points of detail or of style, or even scoring points off the Director. It stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema, a magnificent accomplishment.",
    "This movie is everything I love about movies. It's got great acting, great characters, great story, great dialogue. It's nothing short of amazing. <br/><br/>I haven't seen Farrell in a roll like this before, but he certainly shines. Going from being a brat, to coked up as all hell, to depressed in a matter of minutes and it's hilarious as well as heart breaking.<br/><br/>Gleeson is fantastic in his role too! He plays a perfect mix of cold and calculating, still being sophisticated and also has a conscience of sorts.<br/><br/>Every scene in this movie develops either character or story, and the story unfolds so flawlessly with every passing scene. Going from thinking Ray is just being an arrogant brat to realizing what he has done and why he's acting like he is is a truly fascinating journey, and you can't quite tell whether to laugh or be upset by it, sometimes doing a bit of both at once.<br/><br/>The dialogues and delivery are truly perfect, and it leaves us with so many quotable lines about topics from saving someone you were going to kill from suicide and having a discussion with him about it afterwards to race wars with midgets. Sorry, \"Dwarves\". <br/><br/>The wife telling Harry to bring \"the fellas\" as he leaves and him apologizing for calling her an inanimate object because he was upset brings so much depth to characters and their relationship only from a minute-long scene. True magic with regards to acting and dialogue. This is why dialogue and acting is so important. It brings us closer to the person behind the character and gives the story immensely more depth and excitement.<br/><br/>A cinematic masterpiece!",
    "When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.<br/><br/>Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots. <br/><br/>I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish \"whodunit\" as well. <br/><br/>Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as \"Del Spooner\", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in \"Enemy of the State\" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, \"Independence Day\" and \"Men in Black\". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.<br/><br/>A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. <br/><br/>The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a \"good guy\" or not. <br/><br/>This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.<br/><br/>Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the \"camera moving with moving object\" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment. <br/><br/>In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. <br/><br/>Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that \"I, Robot\" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.<br/><br/>Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie.

    "I heard that this movie received negative reviews and feedback, so I was pleasantly surprised when I enJOYed the movie as much as I did.<br/><br/>There is no denying that the grand appeal to the movie was Jennifer Lawrence's compelling performance. The movie's story itself does not seem like it has much to offer. A poor, overworked woman selling a plastic mop does not sound that thrilling on paper. However, Lawrence takes it up a level to a powerful story about a woman never giving up and making her own opportunities happen against all odds. She takes you on an emotional journey from start to finish. Lawrence has the undeniable ability to make you ache along with her struggles. This can be uncomfortable for the helpless movie-goer, which leads me to wonder if this is the reason so many people had distaste for the film. No one wants to be told that hard work and strong will are not enough to succeed in this world, and, as a whole, \"Joy\" does just that. <br/><br/>That being said, \"Joy\" still left me feeling inspired. As a young, aspiration-filled woman myself, Lawrence's portrayal of Joy makes me feel like I can take on the world (which is dream that current American society consistently crushes on the daily). Lawrence's deadpan stares as she struts in and out of offices along with her turning point bathroom haircut, confirm that both Jennifer and Joy are a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>\"Joy\" also possesses a subtle humor, although many reviews seem to deny its existence. The purposefully over the top soap opera scenes obsessed over by bed-bound Terry (played by Virginia Madsen) are just enough to raise the otherwise dark tone. <br/><br/>Lawrence and David O. Russell take you on an emotional journey with \"Joy.\" It may not be the uplifting movie you want this holiday season, but I would argue it is the movie you need.",
    "We all remember being a teenager.  A crazy, intense time when your high were higher and your lows were lower, and every experience was that much more significant.<br/><br/>John Hughes movie brilliantly captures that environment, that era in our lives, and all the social rifts that we all helped to create for ourselves. I have heard it said that \"The Breakfast Club\" is melodramatic, overacted, and simplistic.  If you subscribe to that flippant perspective you might as well join Vernon in his office because you are doing the same thing that he did.  Seeing the movie as you want to see it, in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions.<br/><br/>If you really want to understand this film, think back to your own high school days.  Think about your last year there.  Dig out your old diary or book of angstful poems and reaquaint yourself with who you were then, when you felt things more deeply.  \"The Breakfast Club\" does not exist not for highschool kids, as some suggest.  Why would they need it?  They live there. It exists for all of us who have already been through there, who feel that they are above it now.  It exists so that we can remember what it was like and better understand ourselves, and the next generation.  Because you can't dismiss something you understand.",
    "I really believe that they billed this movie wrong.  Many folks came in expecting the next Star Wars and were disappointed, to say the least.  It's not like Star Wars.  It's kinda like a live action comic book.  Visually stunning, awesome use of color that just jumps out at you, and non-stop action, lots of it done with tongue firmly in cheek. Plot?  Well forget the plot, it's the weak point of the film.  But hey who ever said comic books had to have strong plots? Willis, Jovovich, and the rest do a fine job.  I especially like the casting of Jovovich, she exudes innocence, vulnerability, sex, exotica, intelligence, and kung fu machismo all at the same time. So turn off the cynicism sign as you watch and just enjoy the ride.  Great stuff!",
    "The imaginative but well-conceived idea of dishing up a romance upon lovers communicating spiritually owing to one of them is dead, was first filmed by Steven Spielberg 8 months before the Ghost's silver screen release. Spielberg's movie Always(1989) had classy use of visuals fulfilling the needs of viewers with mystery-based expectations. Yet, Always lacked the sense of essential romance concept, despite having the same plot and even the same storyline in Ghost. Originally the idea has been created by Chandler Sprague and David Boehm.<br/><br/>However, Ghost accomplished of what \"Always\" tried and failed to accomplish. Thanks to the great acting trio of Patrick Swayze + Demi Moore + Whoopi Goldberg, for together they registered indelible moments into Ghost. It is scraped in our memory how in time Molly and Sam happen to keep their thoughts off each others' feelings, and that taught us: \"Love begins with emotions, ends with thoughts\". On this account they never called off their faith on believing that they will keep an enduring love affair. These indelible scenes in Ghost are conceptually cut where the editing was so impressive that instead of trying to make the story more plausible, it empowered the devotion of lovers onto their relation. The scene which Sam's ghost drew upon Oda Mae's body to break the longing with Molly by kissing her is an imperishable cinematic instant. <br/><br/>I was in love with someone, and it was February,2005; we were both watching the Ghost on TV, both talking on the phone. Then that scene came upon(Sam's ghost kissing Molly in Oda Mae's body), I felt lost deep in my heart seeking the girl I'm talking on the phone. I heard she was crying and sobbing, and keep saying to me: \"I will never forget the first time you kissed me and I don't need to be alive to recall this\" Ghost is one timeless romantic masterpiece that had its moments. For me the kissing scene was the best kiss in movies of all time. MTV had honoured this kiss as well, several years after the release of the movie, as the best kiss in '90s. Superimposing that, the scenes where Oda Mae Brown convinces Molly that Sam's ghost is around her and then Molly reasons with police that Oda Mae knows what nobody is able to know but Sam and herself only, are the scenes that deliver the magic beyond eyes and beyond ears.<br/><br/>To watch Ghost is in the to do list of what to do when you're on a date.",
    "In the case of this movie, the Oscar was well deserved. The film was nominated in the wrong category, though ('Best Foreign Language Film'). It should have been up for 'Best Picture', 'Best Original Screenplay', 'Best Director - and it should have won all of those. As far as I'm concerned, this may very well be the finest film on the subject of war - or conflict in general - that was ever made. I've never seen anything similar; this film manages to show so many aspects of war, of human nature; it somehow manages to capture the essence of something that is inexplicable. Truly one of a kind and a must-see. And don't think for one second that this is some pretentious drivel or slow art-house fare - this is very much the opposite. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",
    "After reading some of the reviews that trash this film I had to speak up.<br/><br/>This film is gritty and dirty. There is content which is not pleasant, swearing and violence amounts other things. What else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? Well more than that actually, it about choices and what you Choose! Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did. At no point did it ever say \"Look at this, its cool.\" For those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in Britain, not just Scotland. I being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.<br/><br/>That being said, those things do not take anything away from the film, the quality of plot and story, or the acting which is Stunning! Robert Carlise as Begbe was excellent, and Ewan MacGregor shined. Also the character Spud was worth a mention he really was quite good.<br/><br/>This film is in my Opinion a work of Genius, that represents the book accurately.",
    "This review gives everything away, so see the movie first.<br/><br/>It is neither allegory nor satire, the two finest categories in both fiction and cinema, and yet it approaches perfection anyway. It is of a nature I have no name for, but it is a nature that reveals truth and undermines falsehoods. <br/><br/>Nothing is more cloaked in falsehood than the victor's depiction of past wars. It is especially true of the children of the victors--especially the children of US WWII veterans, like myself.<br/><br/>We get our view of the war from movies like Audi Murphy in To Hell and Back or Saving Private Ryan. Nothing but praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy. <br/><br/>But QT exposes this hypocrisy by engineering a film where we are disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and then by the excesses of our heroes. That is the first instance. The hypocrisy is slammed home in the second instance where we are first disgusted by the sight of American after American being shot dead by by a German sniper hero and secondly brought to revel in the butchery of several hundred enemy at the hands of our heroes. Tit for tat.<br/><br/>It fits the pattern of praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy, but because it is presented both ways the hypocrisy becomes self- evident. This is why so many people hate the movie--even if they fail to realize it. High art, true art, 10 of 10.",
    "I just saw the first screening ever of Hot Rod at the Los Angeles Film Festival.<br/><br/>As a fan of The Lonely Island, I went into this movie with high expectations. I can happily say that not only were they met but they were exceeded. This is by far the funniest, strangest and most ingenious comedy of the summer. The movie has some of the most random gags ever seen on film. This film is not for everyone: it has no stars and the comedy is very strange. But give it a chance and you will not regret it. The directing and editing of the film is both stylish and fast paced. Andy Samberg is hilarious as always but the supporting cast truly shines, particularly Bill Hader, Will Arnett and Ian McShane. Also look for an INSANELY hilarious cameo from director Akiva Shaffer. If you love the SNL digital shorts this movie is for you. Hot Rod is destined to be a cult comedy classic.",
    "I always thought Captain America was a corny \"golden age of comics\" superhero that had long passed his expiration date. I was shocked by how much I liked him in his first film. I was delighted to grow to like him even more in this one. They set up the character beautifully in the first movie, but he explodes as a hero here. It's hard to fault the character or this movie. Not just the MC, but the whole cast was well written and acted here. The action is well directed and tense. Battles feel much more real than most Marvel battles. There was much less obvious CGI than most films in the franchise, and it pays off. This is one of the best Marvel films to date. Lightning in a bottle. A highlight in the MCU.",
    "SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.<br/><br/>The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to \"weed out all non-hackers\". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes \"Cowboy\" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes \"Gomer Pyle\" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. <br/><br/>The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.<br/><br/>The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined \"hours of boredom, seconds of terror\" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. <br/><br/>'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the \"duality of Man\" according to Jung. 10/10",
    "And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive \"Spider-Man\" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.",
    "Overall I enjoyed the movie. There have been too many recent films about the Tudors and Elizabeth in particular, but this film looks good and it keeps you entertained. It's set at the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588. Elizabeth is shown as tough, smart, and married to her country. She also suffers from bouts of insecurity and irrational jealousies. This film is more hagiographic and melodramatic than its predecessor. <br/><br/>The film tends to ignore the facts when they get in the way of the story. Elizabeth was 55 at the time of the Spanish Armada and she was never a looker. Blanchett's Queen is youngish and attractive. Blanchett's acting performance is powerful and impressive but also a bit stagy. The way the politics of the time are depicted is a bit too black and white. The Spanish look grim and are dressed in dark colors. They are portrayed as crazy, religious zealots. Spain had a right to be upset at English privateers / pirates who attacked their ships and stole their gold. Mary, Queen of Scots is shown as a dowdy, schemer who disliked Elizabeth. The reality was that Mary was a pretty bimbo who made bad choices when it came to men.<br/><br/>Parts of the film veer too much towards soap-opera. Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen)becomes a favorite, but when Bess Throckmorton, one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting and Raleigh get secretly married, Elizabeth becomes jealous and behaves badly. Later, Raleigh and Francis Drake are shown defeating the Spanish at sea. In reality Raleigh was looking after the coastal defenses in the South West of England and didn't marry Throckmorton until 1591. The real Raleigh was a brilliant man: soldier, explorer, writer, poet and courtier and probably deserves his own film. The film is good fun but it's simplistic, cartoon history.",
    "A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Helen Mirren works a miracle with her characterization. When the Queen is forced by circumstances to address her people and mourn in public Diana's death, Helen Mirren doesn't forget that her character is a seasoned public speaker but not an actress. When she delivers her speech to her subjects, the real strength is in her commitment to her duty and not the meaning of her words. It is a chilling, masterful acting stroke. Stephen Frears uses the brilliantly structured script to reveal something that's always being in front of our eyes but we've never seen. The privacy of the most public people in the world. Michael Sheen is terrific as Blair and every piece of casting is truly inspired but it's Helen Mirren's film, oh yeah, one hundred per cent.",
    "`The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped, bound and gagged, into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most, if not all, of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet, Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving indifference, to be a criminal-type with a heart of gold, and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline, which exists merely as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed, well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright, sparkling sheen.   In fact, Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham, who makes for a very `cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",
    "I was in my mid-thirties when the Beatles came to America, and appeared at Shea Stadium and (famously) on the Ed Sullivan. I saw their success, with the screaming girls, as just another teen-age phenomenon. I must have read in some column that this film was interesting for its direction and photography. That was true. What I did not expect was that I would be caught up by the Beatles themselves, both as personalities and as musicians. Those who comment adversely on their lack of acting ability are way off base, because neither they nor the director were looking for dramatic skill; only for a degree of naturalness, which was achieved. Those who criticize the technical aspects are not well-acquainted with new developments in film technique especially in France; for instance, the jump shot. Those who criticize lack of plot must be interested only in straight narrative. I suggest that all the previously mentioned critics see the documentary materials on the making of the film, particularly those contained in the DVD set. They will see, for better or worse, that the creators and performers achieved what they wanted, allowing room for the unexpected. For forty years now I have been an admirer, own all their recordings, etc.; and taught this movie in my history of film class regularly. Don't believe the nay-sayers; see for yourself.",
    "Pardon my knowledge on real life Chris Kyle but in terms of movie, this is awesome. I'm not from america and don't know more about the \"man\" Bradley portrayed.

    "I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original – just: Wow!<br/><br/>It's clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the 'office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) – this movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for film geeks like me.

    "Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, \"Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie\". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie. It tells the story of an older man and young woman who are both going through rough times and are able to reach out to one another. The story is truly touching and sends out a great message about life and how we live. Of course, I do not recommend it for young audiences due to some graphic material, but if you are looking for a great story and genuine acting from Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and,yes, even Justin Timberlake, I encourage you to see 'Black Snake Moan'.",
    "Grand Illusion is a movie about class that doesn't hate anyone. How often does that happen? Yes, there are namby-pamby movies that \"show all sides\" and bore everyone with their non-existent point-of-view, but that's not what I mean. And, of course, there are plenty of movies about class that reveal their biases from the start; I'm rather fond of Eat the Rich movies, myself. But Grand Illusion is about class without dismissing any of its characters. The aristocrats whose world is disappearing are presented as tragic figures, stuck in a code of life that is rapidly becoming meaningless. Both aristocrats know their time is past; the French one accepts this as probably a good thing, the German one doesn't (and blames the French one's sentiments on the French Revolution), but they both know their way of life is soon to be forgotten. And it would be easy for Renoir, when he made the film in the mid-30s a French communist with proletarian sympathies, to demonize these two. But he doesn't; he allows them their humanity, which is the most characteristic feature of Renoir movies in any event (he is the great humanist of movie history).<br/><br/>Nor does he show the collapse of the old way as an unfortunate preface to chaos. The bourgeois characters are good people. The world might be safe in their hands, as safe as in any other hands at least (except for the propensity among nations for war). All of the middle and lower-class characters in the movie are presented as people, not stereotypes. But Renoir doesn't accomplish this by collapsing all class boundaries into some homogenous universalism. These characters remain trapped within their class, and their class is clear to the viewer. The movie is not about the absence of class but about the crushing ironies of the very real existence of class in the lives of the characters. To show all classes without condescension, while retaining a particular point of view (that while people are good, it's best that the aristocratic world is in decline), is pretty amazing.<br/><br/>\nIn Grand Illusion, the nominal hero is working/middle-class, but the upper class isn't evil and the lower class isn't romanticized or dismissed. And it's all accomplished in such a seamless way that many, if not most, first-time viewers might easily think it was a fine movie but something less than great. It sneaks up on you, and more than just about any film you can name, rewards multiple viewings.",
    "\"The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived, without wealth, without property, without official title or office.  Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies, nor the ruler of vast lands.  He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift.  Yet men, governments, dignitaries from all over the world, have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth, who led his country to freedom.\"<br/><br/>This quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film \"Gandhi\".  Richard Attenborough directed this massive epic about the man that freed India. The film opens with Gandhi's assassination.  The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi's funeral on January 31st, 1981, the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral.  It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation. This film was made before CGI (computer generated images), so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed.<br/><br/>\nMahatma Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art.  This film has made and will make millions of people aware of the little brown man that took on the British Empire and won.  \"Gandhi\" serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history.<br/><br/>\nBen Kingsley played Gandhi.  He was the perfect for the role.  He resembled the real Gandhi.  He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man. He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.   He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part. And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the \"big-time actor\" persona did not get in the way of viewing the film.  He did win both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor, for this role, which I agree he deserved.  He became Gandhi.<br/><br/>The cinematography was outstanding.  Attenborough filmed \"Gandhi\" on location in India.  The scenes of India are spectacular, and India is very much another character in the film.  This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi.  Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta.  It is suggested by Kingsley, on the DVD, that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming.  They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman.  Undeterred by their negative thinking, he persevered to enlist thousands of Indians to help make this film.  Every crowd scene, he used real Indians from the area. Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for everyone.  It should be required viewing in high schools, as part of History class.  The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant.  It is also a beautiful work of art.  This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood (see \"Pearl Harbor\" for that). Of course, it would have been hard to screw up a movie about such a great man. 10/10",
    "Father Gabriel: \"If might is right, then Love has no place in this world...\"<br/><br/>The movie by Roland Joffe was not popular in my country when it was released since such movies were censored by the communists. When, however, the situation changed in 1989, I remember that I saw THE MISSION for the first time on Polish TV in 1995 as a part of cinema's 100th anniversary celebration. The movie moved me so much that I have come back to it several times since then. Each time I see it, I find something new in the film. Therefore, I consider THE MISSION one of the very best films ever made, a film where history meets single individuals, where sadness is conquered by joy and disbelief and skepticism by profound thoughts on humanity.<br/><br/>The content of the film, though historical, applies perfectly to modern times. The universal struggle of two spirits, the one of might and the one of Love, has always been noticeable wherever and whenever people live. Let us look briefly at the gist of the content: the Jesuits build a mission in the core of a jungle in South America, they understand the heart of the Gospels: Love without looking for reward. Yet, the politics of the conquerors (Spaniards and the Portuguese) steps in and destroys the mission... However, not everything dies even though goodness seems to be conquered... This story, presented here in a condensed way but developed in the film is so powerful that it leads to reflections: what, in fact, reigns in our lives; why good people have to suffer, why we are forced to do what we hate, it is so effortless to destroy while to build requires so much strength, why the world turns our good deeds into evil, etc. This aspect is the pearl of the film and the feast for the soul even though such thoughts require some courage from an individual. I reflected on the fact if I am willing to support the weak or if I rather choose might which is my master I attempt at in my actions? It's strange but we will never get to know our personalities completely... And that is what the film also shows. Altamiro (Ray Mc Anally), for instance, is a person of different psychological states hard to evaluate.<br/><br/>The performances are exceptionally powerful which makes THE MISSION a very nice piece of film art. Jeremy Irons gives a very powerful performance as Father Gabriel expressing all values a good Christian should own: goodness, gentleness, patience, courage, and purity. He has this blink in his eyes that makes his portrayal particularly memorable. Robert De Niro... I would say frankly that this is his very best acting. People concentrate on different films when they hear of De Niro's performances, particularly in Michael Cimino's THE DEER HUNTER (1978) or in Martin Scorsese's CAPE FEAR (1991). Some of them skip THE MISSION. Yet his portrayal of Rodrigo Mendoza is a masterpiece in its own. This role is difficult to portray since Mendoza is a man of two contradictory spirits: from a slave trader to the devoted Jesuit. Nevertheless, De Niro does a marvelous job. One moment caught my attention from the first view of the film: Mendoza's death and this nostalgic look at Jesus in the Eucharist (even while writing about this moment a tear appears unintentionally in the eye). Ray McAnnally portrays Altamiro, a bishop who is forced to do what he actually does not intend to. He seems to be touched by the mission and in spite of that, he finally allows for slaughters. In the final shot, he expresses one thing powerfully: a face of a man whose conscience will forever suffer. \"Thus we have made the world...thus have I made it,\" which are his words said at the end by him clearly show what kind of person he was.<br/><br/>Another powerful aspect of the film is music. Ennio Morricone is famous for having written music to many films but here, in THE MISSION, he did something absolutely sublime. I bought a CD listening to music alone and it was an unforgettable experience for me. People who heard it and did not see the film asked me where I got such wonderful tunes. Indian rhythms combined with Christian spirituality and ecclesiastic chorus - UNFORGETTABLE! I promise you that having seen this film, you will never forget, among other things, these lovely tunes.<br/><br/>The filming locations, which obviously constitute an additional aspect in any film, add a thrill and authenticity to everything. It is hard to imagine other places in THE MISSION. The movie is shot mostly in the places where the historical events took place. We see the mighty Iguazu waterfalls, the jungle where Guarani Indians live, the city of Cartagena in Colombia as well as the hills of the Brazil-Argentinian border.<br/><br/>What more is there to say? I think that most readers will agree with me that THE MISSION is a masterpiece, a film that opens people to new horizons of understanding the profound thoughts that are there in our lives if we are willing to reflect on them or not. Speaking religiously, Christ has once died on the Cross but then all was conquered by Love.<br/><br/>The final scene gives an answer to Father Gabriel's thought that I entailed at the beginning. A silent sunny day in the jungle... we see a small group of Indian children who have survived the destruction. A little girl picks up a violin that she finds in the river and they begin to row a small boat towards the future... <br/><br/>Father Gabriel, you are right. It seems that Love perhaps has no place in this world and might may seem to be right but it is always Love that wins since \"the spirit of the dead will survive in the memory of the living.\"",
    "Today when I was at my house alone, looking through my DVDs, trying to figure out which movie I should see for entertainment. I saw E.T and I hadn't seen it for nearly 3-4 years ago. I seen the film ever since I was 4 years old, so I wondering if I would still enjoy it when I'm an adult. As I was watching the film, I had this rush of nostalgia running through me, I was remembering the times when I was a kid with my family. The film didn't at all feel to childish to me, I was actually having a lot of fun, like I used to when I was a kid. This film has not aged at all since 30 years ago. This film is a truly timeless film, and will always be remembered. This is one of the best Steven Spielberg films. (And that is no easy task) A Timeless Classic 10/10",
    "I am written this review In Memorie of my all time favorite the best horror director Wes Craven that sadly is no longer with us anymore. On August 30th 2015, Craven died of brain cancer at home in Los Angeles. I am doing this for him. <br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American supernatural Classic slasher horror film written and directed by Wes Craven, and the first film of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. <br/><br/>The best horror flick I have ever seen.I love this film to death, I love it!!! It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. It is my number 1 favorite film in the franchise it stays in my heart forever. I am a big fan of this film I even have a poster hang on door in my room, my girlfriend give it to me as gift. I love some other films of Wes Craven that he directed like are New Nightmare, Scream, Shocker,The People Under the Stairs, Scream 2 and Scream 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) for me will be always in the genre the best slasher classic horror film written and directed by Wes Craven. He gave us Freddy Krueger which was followed six sequels one crossover and one remake after success of the first film that gross $26.505.000 in USA. The sequel after the first film A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge was refused from Wes Craven to work on the film because he never wanted or intended A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) to become an ongoing franchise (and even wanted the first film to have a happy ending), and also because he didn't like the idea of Freddy manipulating the protagonist into committing the murders. The sequel for me wasn't a good movie after the original was released. My top 5 films of We Craven would be A Nightmare On Elm Street, Scream , New Nightmare, Shocker and The People Under the Stairs. <br/><br/>The first film is so original, realistic, and overall terrifying horror classic slasher flick that is actually happening in dreams, a sociopath child killer with sharp clawed glove who has knives in stead for a fingers, can enter into your dreams. If he kills you in your dreams, you're dead for real. The main protagonist is Nancy Thompson a teenager where her friends start dying and are killed one by one from Freddy Krueger, she try's to warn people from Freddy coming in to their dreams, but no one listens to her not her father the Sheriff not her mom or her friends. Her parents hold a dark secret from her long ago. She is alone in this and she has to fight him by her self by going back in to her dreams and get Freddy out of her dream in to the real world. Nancy the character was so clever, smart and intense carefully. She was awesome unique legendary heroine did you see how she put booby-traps for Freddy? Awesome!<br/><br/>Tina Grey played by Amanda Wyss, is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film. <br/><br/>Heather Langenkamp is excellent in her role as the main protagonist in this film. She's legendary unique teen heroine a very attractive,and gives 100% as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares. <br/><br/>Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger the actor's contribution to the character is 100% superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa, even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence, he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation: Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series, Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. For me Robert Englund will be the only Freddy Krueger I love him in all Nightmare films. <br/><br/>John Saxon as Lt. Donald Thompson, Nancy's dad was fantastic in his role and his performance. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp in his first role as Glen Lantz was awesome, I seriously loved him in 21 Jump Street TV Series and today I still love him in Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. <br/><br/>I love the main theme Nightmare Freddy Krueger score from Charles Bernstein and I love the song at the of the credits Nightmare by 213.<br/><br/>A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) is the best classic slasher film,one of the best horror movies ever made. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. My number one favorite horror film in the franchise and it will always be the best one in the series. I have always enjoyed seeing this film, it is fast paced, entertaining, not boring or over long film, but short and very intense from the beginning till the end. I love this movie death. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",
    "Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.<br/><br/>He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.<br/><br/>Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute."

Anya Taylor-Joy delivers a mesmerizing performance as Thomasin, a young girl caught in a downward spiral of suspicion and fear. Her emotional journey is portrayed with exceptional skill and nuance, making her character sympathetic and relatable despite the bizarre circumstances.\n\n\"The Witch\" is not a film that relies on cheap scares and jump scares. Instead, Eggers employs a slow-building tension that gradually escalates throughout the film, creating an unnerving atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll. The eerie musical score and the stunning cinematography further contribute to the film's oppressive mood, leaving the audience on edge and constantly guessing.\n\nWhile some may find the deliberate pacing of the film frustrating, it ultimately serves a purpose. The deliberate slow burn allows the tension to simmer, generating a sense of impending doom that adds weight to the unsettling climax. This may not be a film for those seeking instant gratification and gore, but for those willing to invest in a thought-provoking and psychologically chilling experience, \"The Witch\" is a true gem.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Witch\" is a shining example of a horror film that relies on atmosphere, storytelling, and exceptional performances to create genuine fear and unease.

Muschietti masterfully brings King's iconic story to life, skillfully balancing suspense, jump scares, and psychological horror.\n\nOne of the film's biggest strengths is its exceptional ensemble cast, particularly the young actors who portray the Losers' Club. Each member brings their character to life with authenticity and charm, making it easy to become emotionally invested in their journey. Standout performances include Jaeden Martell as the determined Bill Denbrough and Sophia Lillis as the fearless Beverly Marsh.\n\nAnother element that sets \"It\" apart is its stellar production design. The town of Derry is wonderfully realized, with a palpable sense of danger lurking in every corner. The attention to detail in the sets and costumes immerses the audience in the eerie atmosphere of the story, effectively enhancing the overall sense of dread.\n\nThe film's score, composed by Benjamin Wallfisch, is haunting and unsettling, perfectly complementing the tension on screen.

    " As a fan of the 21 Jump Street movies, I knew I would enjoy this comedy featuring two of the stars of that franchise, and I wasn't disappointed. This movie features a hilarious performance by Cameron Diaz, who is well-paired with co-star Jason Segel, who plays the immature and uncouth teacher Mr. Calvin. Both Diaz and Segel are surrounded by a strong supporting cast, including Molly Sims, who plays the school's principal, and Dallas Roberts, who plays the school's creepy counselor. The movie follows the misadventures of Ms. Diaz's character, who is planning to retire from teaching and use the money from her retirement account to finance a life of luxury in the Philippines. The humor is frequently crude and often borders on being inappropriate, but it's generally funny. The movie doesn't break any new ground, but it features enough laughs and charm to make it worth watching.",
    " While watching Blood Diamond, I couldn't help but think that this story would have been better suited for a mini-series, because there's entirely too much going on here. Not that it's a bad film, there's just too much material, and it suffers in the editing room as a result.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio gives another one of his \"I'm going to be intense and I'm going to haul ass all over the globe to track down the bad guys\" performances reminiscent of Catch Me If You Can and The Beach. This movie is a political thriller with a message, and the message is mostly conveyed by DiCaprio's character through monotonic, stoic dialogue-driven scenes.\n\nThe plot revolves around diamonds in Sierra Leone, and the exploitation and genocide caused by the diamond trade. It's an important topic, and one that's obviously quite relevant given current world events- but I think this story tries to cover too much ground, and as a result the characters are a bit shallow. It's hard to become too invested in any of them.\n\nThis film was also reminiscent of another political thriller with a message, Hotel Rwanda. That film succeeded where this one fails in my opinion, because the characters in that film were more engaging and the story more focused.\n\nStill, this is an important film that raises awareness for an important issue, and it's worth seeing for that reason alone. Just don't expect a tightly-woven thriller in the same vein as something like Syriana.",
    " Although this film adaptation of the novel by Walter Tevis, The Hustler, starring Paul Newman as \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, suffers from a somewhat overdrawn and unrealistic ending, it is still a great film.\n\nThe story is based on the relentless pursuit by Felson of an uncatchable mark, performed in stark contrast to the seemingly carefree maneuvering of the mark, \"The Man,\" played by Jackie Gleason.\n\nDuring the course of the film, we see Felson challenged by The Man who sees in Felson a kindred spirit, and in their game the former takes great pleasure in defeating the talent and ego of the latter. Perhaps The Man enjoys seeing himself in the mirror of Felson, or what he once was, or perhaps he enjoys the youth and over-confidence of Felson, all of which is spelled out for the audience in nearly naked terms by Ms. Bernstein, who seems to have no other function in the film than to spell this out.\n\nThe tension of the film is driven by the contests of skill between Felson and The Man, interrupted only by the occasional dating sequence with Mona, played by Piper Laurie, or Felson's brother, Lester, convincingly played by Myron McCormick.\n\nAt the end of his rope, Felson takes on The Man -- the original fast dealer -- and is beaten according to the terms of their contract. Feelson, broke, owes The Man one hundred dollars for every cent he has in the world, and The Man, kindly, suggests that Feelson give him a call when he earns the money to pay him.\n\nWe next see Feelson in a small room garbed in monk's robes. He has earned enough money playing small time games in the local neighborhood to pay his debt to The Man. He calls The Man, and surprisingly The Man answers the phone himself, telling Feelson that he has gotten lucky and scored big -- he doesn't need the money anymore, and doesn't want to take it. He tells Feelson to \"go out and find him,\" meaning The Man has retired, and wants only to play for the love of the game.\n\nThis, of course, is the explosion of realism in an otherwise very well done film. It is highly unlikely that The Man would have given up the chance to win the money owed to him, or that Feelson would have been able to retire if he had been forced to pay off his debt. But perhaps this explosion of realism at the end lends a",
    " One of the most intriguing, challenging, and thought-provoking films of 2011, \"Incendies\" is an ideal choice for audiences who appreciate films that delve into the darker side of the human condition, as well as those who are looking for a unique and emotionally powerful cinematic experience.\n\nThe film, which is directed by Denis Villeneuve, tells the story of twins who are tasked with delivering the letter from their mother that reveals a shocking secret that has been hidden from them their entire lives. The film explores the themes of identity, family, and the repercussions of the past as it shapes the present and future.\n\nThe film's performances are top-notch, with Lubna Azabal giving a particularly powerful and moving performance as the twins' mother.

    " Hart's War is a movie starring Bruce Willis, Colin Farrell, and Terrence Howard. It's about a trio of prisoners of war who are officers and kept in generally good conditions by the Germans. However, an offer comes for one of them to collaborate with the Germans, and this creates a crisis of conscience and ethics within the trio.\nThe movie is pretty good. The acting is first rate. I don't think any of the three leads are really given the opportunity to shine, but they are all solid. The story is a little bit predictable. There aren't a lot of surprises, but for a movie with a relatively simple premise, that's not so bad. I think the movie does a good job of showing the pressures on the trio and showing the audience what it is they value and why. It's not the most exciting movie, but it's definitely worth a watch.",
    " The greatest flaw of \"La La Land\" is it takes two wildly different movies and smushes them together for no logical reason. Why did the writers, who I'm assuming are desperate for people to like this film, think it would be a good idea to shoehorn a secondary storyline that has nothing to do with the couple? It's obvious by the end that it's meant to be a bittersweet ending, and I'm okay with that. The singing and dancing numbers are very entertaining and well-done, and the actors have undeniable chemistry. The failures of the script and story outweigh those strengths, and I couldn't get past how poorly written the second act is. There's no reason for Mia and Sebastian to break up other than the writers needing a way to stretch the runtime. Even then, they could've padded the first act a little more and had the same effect. Too bad, because the direction and performances are excellent. It just needed a more focused script.",
    " Although it suffers in comparison to it's [sic] predecessor, The Godfather: Part III is still one of the greatest sequels ever made, and deserves it's [sic] place as the second installment in perhaps the greatest trilogy in movie history.\n\nThe film achieves the impossible by making you root for Michael Corleone, even more than you did in the first film, while simultaneously making you hate him.

    " 'The Island' flops on every level, failing to introduce fresh enough ideas to save it from its derivative plot and its dullness.\"\n\nWell that about sums it up. This is a film that is so dull and unoriginal that it gives you nothing to laugh at and very little to think about. I'm all for environmental messages, but this film is far too concerned with pushing its agenda and so ends up forgetting to be a film. Action-wise there is very little save for some standard shoot-outs, and logic-wise there is so much missing that you wonder how the producers ever got to the final cut.\n\nThat's not to say that there aren't some decent enough performances. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson manage to save some face by giving decent performances that at times manage to convince you that there is a good film here. At all other times they look as bored as the audience. Johansson seems to be trying out a Scottish accent as she takes on the role of the daughter of McGregor's character. Though it does slip occasionally it's not a bad effort and she manages to pull it off well enough. It's just a shame that the material they are working with is so weak.\n\nThe story concerns a group of people who are part of a community that has been hiding and preserving the last of the remaining animals of earth in an enclosure. However, the villains of the piece, led by Michael Clarke Duncan, want to get their hands on the enclosure and sell off the animals. Duncan manages to chew the scenery as the baddie, but it's all too predictable and dull.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with this film. The dialogue is poor, the story is non-existent and the action only serves to remind you how dull this film is. The only bright spot is the performances of McGregor and Johansson. If it wasn't for them this film would be so bad that you'd have to wonder whether the producers were taking the piss. As it is, it's just badly made and poorly thought out.",
    " Charged by its pertinent subject matter, and propelled by Jordan Peele's confident feature debut, Get Out is a formidable entry in the horror genre. Peele weaves a plausible conspiracy theory into his screenplay, arguing that cosmetic alterations have diminished the humanity of an entire race of people. The filmmaker offers a stern rebuke to a society that encourages us to be passive observers, and he underscores his point with a horrific massacre that's unveiled in a startling sequence during the climax. It's in these moments that Get Out resonates most, when its biases are laid bare and its characters must confront the cruel absurdities of white supremacy.\n\nMany of the film's most impressive attributes are owed to Daniel Kaluuya, who holds the screen with an effortless magnetism. He gives a finely tuned performance that walks a tightrope between humor and horror, and he's precisely the sort of compelling everyman every hero ought to be. All too often, we settle for male protagonists who are defined by their bravery or strength – traits that border on absurdity when we're asked to believe they've never before encountered a dangerous situation. Kaluuya is saved from this trap by his panicked expressions and occasional tremors, which confirm that Chris is mortal – and mortal peril is always more believable.\n\nKaluuya is also aided by a witty,economical script that infuses the film with incisive social commentary. Take, for example, the way in which the residents of the Armitage household speak in jargon that's barely coherent, rendering them nearly impossible to understand. It's the sort of pointed detail that indicates a perceptive mind at work, and it's clear from these moments that Peele has given considerable thought to the monsters he needs to portray. As such, when the film arrives at its fourth-wall-breaking finale, it takes on the qualities of a horror equivalent of Rashomon, with the truth dependent on one's own experiences. \n\nGet Out arrives at a pertinent moment in popular culture, as black horror stories are finally being given the platform they deserve. That Chris escapes the film with his humanity intact is, in itself, a small miracle – but it's also an indication that the worst has yet to come.",
    " This movie is incredible. It's freakin long and meandering, but the attention to detail is astonishing. Every single scene serves a purpose, and even the minor characters have fully realized backstories and personalities. It's hilarious, and saddening, and thrilling, and maddening, and beautifully filmed. Yes, the soundtrack is great (though I disagree with Davis' assertion that it's the second best album ever made) but the DRASTIC tones and moods the Coens manage to evoke over the course of this film are what really make it work. Not many filmmakers have the courage or vision to make a film THIS risk-takingly slow. They deserve tremendous credit for that. Also, the fracking representations are very unsettling and effective. Overall, this is a tremendously rewarding film that offers rich rewards on multiple viewings. Very few films released in the last decade can boast that.\n\n911 of 1010 people found this review helpful. Was this review helpful?",
    " 'Taxi Driver' is arguably the greatest film Martin Scorsese has ever made, and furthermore, one of the most intense and gripping films ever unleashed on an unsuspecting public. It follows the events of a few days in the life of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a lonely cab driver who navigates the mean streets of New York City.\n\nTravis lives in a run-down apartment and works tirelessly as a cab driver, but his attempts to connect with other people are thwarted by his own insecurities and frustrations with city life. He pines for a pretty yet unavailable female neighbor and goes on increasingly disturbing dates with a political campaign worker. Meanwhile, he becomes increasingly aware of the shabby underworld that exists in even the most seemingly decent neighborhoods.\n\nThen, topping it all off, Travis finds himself compelled to rescue a 12-year-old prostitute (played marvelously by Jodie Foster) and confront the pimp who's been exploiting her.\n\nDe Niro is at his absolute psychotic best in 'Taxi Driver', and gives what is undoubtedly the performance of his career. Travis Bickle is one of the most unsettling, complex characters that has ever been committed to film, and De Niro captures his demons flawlessly. Likewise, Jodie Foster is remarkable in her role as the young girl whom Travis tries to save, and she manages to convey a world of wisdom and resilience beyond her years.\n\nThe remainder of the cast is also stellar, including a memorable performance by Cybill Shepherd as the neighbor who intrigues Travis. Harvey Keitel also stands out in his supporting role.\n\nScorsese's direction is masterful, and he makes brilliant use of camera work, lighting, and editing to keep the audience riveted. The cinematography by Michael Chapman is equally outstanding, and the whole production has a gritty, unsettling look that suits the material perfectly.\n\nThe film also features a highly memorable musical score by Bernard Herrmann, who employs lots of dissonance and unusual instrumentation to create a nerve-wracking effect.\n\nIn conclusion, 'Taxi Driver' is a confronting, yet brilliant film that is just as powerful today as it was when it was made. It is required viewing for any film buff, and is simply one of the finest films ever made.",
    " This is an amazing true story of a real woman, Erin Brockovich, who, despite her humble beginnings, is a brilliant legal mind and fearless consumer advocate. In the mid-1990s, she fought for and won an unprecedented $333 million settlement for hexavalent chromium contamination of the groundwater in the small southern California town of Hinkley. It is a rags to riches story about how one determined, intelligent, and brave woman can make a difference in the world. It is also a story of hope, and that one person can make a difference, no matter what their background, as long as they are willing to work hard and take a stand.\n\nThe movie is brilliant, and Julia Roberts gives one of the best performances of her career. She perfectly captures the strength, determination, and intelligence of Erin Brockovich, and makes the audience root for her and believe in her. The supporting cast is also excellent, and the direction is tight and focused. This is a must-see movie, and a true inspiration for anyone who wants to make a difference in the world.",
    " Complete and utter masterpiece. It's sensual, yet innocent, devout yet lustful, and the chemistry between the two leads is electrifying, yet subtle. It's a film about first love, and it does that subject matter immense justice. Also, the setting is gorgeous and the music selection is perfect. This film easily falls under my list of all-time favorites, and I do not say that lightly. Please do yourself a favor and see this film ASAP. Please note that I did not rate this film a 10 because I do not believe that any film is truly flawless.",
    " While it retains the spirit of the original story, this remake of the 1984 cult classic is actually improved by new directions in the storytelling. Gone is the original's overly convenient ending, replaced by a more realistic and emotionally satisfying conclusion. It's also nice to see that the filmmakers have attempted to make the characters a little more three-dimensional and believable, rather than simply updating the original's cardboard cut-outs with better special effects.\n\nThat's not to say that this version is without its problems. The characterization of Ariel (played by Julianne Hough) is somewhat flawed. Whereas the original focused on Ariel's loyalty to her friends and family, this version seems to suggest that she is a \"good girl\" who deserves sympathy because she is sexually inexperienced and hangs out with the popular kids. Nonetheless, the rest of the cast more than makes up for this, particularly Miles Teller as the rebel without a cause, and country star Kenny Wormald as the new Ren MacCormack. Wormald successfully navigates the fine line between cool and cheesy, and his dancing is genuinely impressive (it should be noted that all of the dancing in this film is highly enjoyable).\n\nBy changing the ending and adding a few new twists and turns, the filmmakers have improved upon the original film. That said, this film will undoubtedly be compared to the 1984 version, and therefore will inevitably be found wanting. This is not, however, a fair comparison. This film is a solid adaptation of the original story, and a highly enjoyable film in its own right.",
    " A fun but somewhat poorly written movie. Peter Stormare is hilarious as the monster's keeper. His character is along the lines of \"Frank the Pug\" from Men in Black, so that should give you an idea of what you're in for. David Wenham is also good as the priest who teams up with Van Helsing. His character is apparently supposed to be the \"straight man\" to Van Helsing's eccentricities, but Van Helsing is so wildly over-the-top that the straight man routine is wasted.\n\nThe monsters are fun, some of them are familiar, like the werewolf, others are new, like the giant bat. They're all computer-generated, and for the most part it shows, unfortunately. The wolfman, especially, looks like he's from a video game. The music is fun, the credits sequence is funny, there are some really good set pieces, like the circus and the ice cave, but the writing is lazy and the story is dull.\n\nI think that Paul Anderson took on a project that was too big for him. This is obviously meant to be Anderson's Dark Knight, but it's just not in the same league. It's a smaller, less-ambitious movie, and it shows. Had Anderson gone for something a little more low-key, I think he might have made a little gem. Instead, he made a comic book come to life, and it didn't work.\n\n6/10",
    " 'Akira' is a stunning, epic film that is unlike anything else out there. It is a visually stunning work of art that is both beautiful and horrific. The story is complex and multi-layered, and the characters are richly drawn and memorable. The acting is top-notch, and the action scenes are thrilling and well-choreographed. Overall, it is a brilliant and thought-provoking film that is a must-see for anyone interested in Japanese animation or just looking for a unique and powerful cinematic experience. \n\nIs there any other information you would like extracted from this review?

    " While \"Three Colors: Blue\" doesn't reach the heights of \"Red,\" it is nonetheless an impressive film in its own right. It is much more emotionally involving than \"White,\" and features a superb performance by Juliette Binoche.\n\nThe story revolves around Julie, a woman living in Geneva who has recently lost her husband and daughter in a car accident. She meets a man named Jean-Louis, and the two begin a tentative romance. However, Julie's feelings of grief and guilt over the death of her family threaten to derail the relationship.\n\nWhat makes \"Blue\" work is Binoche's incredible performance. She is absolutely mesmerizing, and her pain and sadness are almost tangible. The scene in which she finally breaks down and cries for her lost family is heartbreaking.\n\nThe supporting performances are also strong, particularly that of Benoit Regent, who plays Jean-Louis. He is sensitive and compassionate, and his relationship with Julie feels genuine.\n\n\"Three Colors: Blue\" is a moving and elegant film about love, loss, and the healing power of both. It may not be as technically impressive as \"Red,\" but it is more emotionally involving, and that counts for a lot.",
    " A retired CIA operative is dragged back into the world he once tried to escape.\n\nFor a decade, Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) worked for The Company, a top-secret government organization that, in part, paychecked him to wipe out undesirable elements. Now that he's disengaged himself from the grind of the job, McCall has opted to live a less perilous life and to help those in need around him. McCall's new job isn't glamorous: he's an \"Equalizer\" at a hardware store. It's a second-rate home improvement outlet that sells janitorial supplies, but McCall makes the most of it. He buffs floors and cleans toilets, and turns an annoyed frown to angry smiles for whorish customers who want to return clearly used tools. But the relative calm of his life is shattered when one of his friends from The Company is brutally murdered, leaving behind a wife and daughter. McCall is dismayed to learn that his friend's last words were a plea to the Equalizer, and he decides to honor the request. McCall finds himself forced to go up against a group of dangerous Russian gangsters, and he soon ends up making a promise to the dead man's young daughter that he'll protect her from the murderous thugs.\n\nThe plot is a standard-issue revenge tale, but the execution is all. This is an expertly made genre picture; director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) knows how to sustain intensity and he stages the action scenes with a ruthless efficiency. The movie begins with aKill Bill-style blood-soaked onslaught in a darkened hallway and continues on its relentless path to a climax in a crowded subway station. Along the way, there are some killings in a squeaky-clean house and on a rain-soaked bridge. In each instance, the camera is placed in a smart position and the action is edited together with economy and force. Little is done merely for the sake of shock value; this is a gritty, brutal film that treats its subject matter with the appropriate amount of gravity. There's never a sense that the filmmakers are exploiting the material.\n\nWashington gives one of his best post-Training Day performances here. McCall is a man of few words and countless frowns, and Washington plays him as a man who has seen too much and now keeps his head down. But when action is required, Washington doesn't shy away from showing a man who can snap into deadly focus, especially when the people he cares about are in danger. It",
    " A searing, Oscar-winning examination of racial tension, moral decay, and violent revenge, director Paul Haggis' Crash is a potent character study and a gripping thriller.\n\nCrash is a powerful movie; a disturbing, sometimes brutal look at contemporary race relations in Los Angeles. It's also a thoroughly absorbing, intelligently made thriller that holds the audience in its grip right up to the final frame.\n\nThe film tackles issues of racism, bigotry, and police brutality as it examines the lives of a group of people from different racial and social backgrounds who are all connected by a single act of violence.\n\nIt's a credit to Haggis' skill as a writer/director that he is able to create a sense of empathy for all of the main characters, even the most seemingly despicable among them. He humanizes them, makes them vulnerable, and in the process, creates a mirror that reflects the worst and best in all of us.\n\nThe performances are universally excellent. Matt Dillon is compelling as the racist cop with a heart of gold. Sandra Bullock gives one of her best performances as a woman caught in the middle of a hate crime. And Don Cheadle is superb as the ex-con turned businessman who is trying to go straight.\n\nBut it's the smaller roles that really stand out. Thandie Newton is superb as the single mother who is struggling to survive in a tough city. Brendan Fraser is effective as the racist redneck who can't hide his hatred behind his smile. And Jennifer Esposito is wonderful as the concerned wife who is struggling to come to terms with her husband's shortcomings.\n\nThe soundtrack, which features music by James Newton Howard, highlights the action without overshadowing it. And the cinematography, by James M. Taylor, gives the film a gritty, realistic look that perfectly suits the material.\n\nA powerful, thought-provoking movie that will spark discussion and debate long after the credits have rolled, Crash is a remarkable achievement from a filmmaker who is clearly at the top of his game.",
    " This movie successfully creates a feeling of endless dread. Its style is very unique and refreshing, harkening back to classic horror movies of the 1980's while being very distinct. The plot is extremely clever and original, especially for a horror fan like myself as I find most modern horror movies rely too heavily on cheap jump scares. This movie is NOT a jump scare horror, it's a psychological horror that will have your mind working overtime to figure out a way to escape your fate, a fate no one can escape. It's not overly gory or violent, but the few kills in the movie are memorable and unsettling. The sound design and music were perfectly crafted to accent the film's eerie atmosphere. The actors did a great job, though I feel like the character of \"Paul\" was a little underutilized. I really can't think of anything negative to say about this movie, it terrified me and I loved every second of it. I usually watch movies once and then never again, but I've already watched this three times and plan to watch it many more times in the future. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially fans of the horror genre.",
    " As the son of the late King of Wakanda, T'Challa returns home to the isolated, technologically-advanced African nation to succeed to the throne and take his rightful place as king. When an old enemy reappears on the radar, T'Challa's mettle as king and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people and their way of life.\n\nThis film took the world by storm! I still remember when it was released in Myanmar because THAT was the day that all the teenagers in my high school went absolutely crazy. The girls were talking about the \"hot\" characters and the boys were analyzing the action sequences and re-enacting the fight scenes. It was amazing. It's not very often that a film comes out that EVERYONE is talking about. I know that it received criticism for having a nearly all-black cast but seriously people! It's about time that a film portrays a culture that isn't white and it portrays it in a positive light! Also, as a woman, I loved how there were SO many strong female roles in this film. Yes, the men were handsome and tough but the women were handsome, tough, and intelligent which is a rarity in films today. This film sets the bar high for Marvel films to come in the future!",
    " This is a great action movie and I really liked it. It has a large cast of character who are all well developed and a lot of fun.

    " This is a fun movie, but it has a few minor flaws that prevent it from being as good as the first Mummy movie. The story takes a little while to get started, and the action doesn't really pick up until the end of the movie. The acting is a little bit uneven, but Brendan Fraser gives another great performance as Rick O'Connell. The visual effects are excellent, and the movie looks great. There are some fun new creatures, but unfortunately, the movie relies a little too much on CGI. Overall, this is a fun sequel that is worth watching, but it doesn't live up to the original.",
    " This movie was awesome. It has been a long time since I went to the movies and left feeling like I got my money's worth. Superman has always been a hero of mine and I liked the way they updated his origin story. Kal-El is sent from Krypton to Earth, as a infant, as his home planet is destroyed. He is adopted by Martha and Jonathan Kent who teach him about right and wrong and that he has a responsibility to use his gifts for the greater good. As he becomes a man he makes a decision that could save or destroy mankind. Only one man can protect the Earth and this man must make an agonizing decision as Earth is invaded by superior forces. Battle scenes are awesome and the story, for the most part, is very well done. I am not a fan of the ending and some of the acting was not the best but all in all this was a great super hero flick. If you are a fan of Superman you will not be disappointed.\n\nDo you think this review is more positive or negative?",
    " Although much has been written about the making of this film, and about the forces that conspired to bring together such a strange ensemble cast, it is ultimately the strength of the script, and the empathy and humanity of the principal performances, that elevate _Dog Day Afternoon_ far above the realm of the average. It is a bracingly realistic, and ultimately optimistic view of the human condition, and of one man's attempts to overcome the limitations of his own nature and fulfill the expectations of those around him, despite his own better judgment and despite the overwhelming obstacles that he faces.\n\nAl Pacino gives what is undoubtedly the performance of his career as Sonny, the dyslexic bank robber who is unable to distinguish between the letters \"R\" and \"L\". He is strongly supported by Christopher Walken as his sexually frustrated and violent partner in crime, along with a number of strong performances from members of the supporting cast, including John Cazale, who gives what was ultimately his final performance before his death, and who provides a touch of humanity and dignity to the role of Sonny's plainclothes accomplice.\n\nThe film itself is divided into two distinct halves. The first half is a grimly humorous look at Sonny's attempts to rob a bank, and the unexpectedly positive reactions of the bank's customers to his actions. This section of the film is filled with sharp observations and witty dialogue, and ends on a brilliantly staged shoot-out, followed by Sonny's impulsive decision to hold the customers of the bank hostage backstage.\n\nThe second half of the film is a more conventional hostage drama, with Sonny making demands over the phone while negotiating with the police, and struggling to maintain the hostages' morale, as well as his own. The climactic resolution is unexpectedly moving and affirmative, and offers a refreshing alternative to the nihilistic and depressing endings of so many films of the era.\n\n_Dog Day Afternoon_ was one of the first films to address the issue of homosexuality in a realistic and sympathetic manner, and does so here by presenting us with a complex array of homosexual characters, without defining them by their sexuality. In this, as well as in its frank and unsentimental view of human behavior, it foreshadows the work of such directors as Joel and Ethan Coen.\n\nA small masterpiece of modern cinema, and one of the most overlooked films of the 1970s. A must-see for fans of Al Pacino, and an absorbing and entertaining experience for everyone else.",
    " While this is a visually stunning film, and it certainly has its heartwarming moments, the fact that it is NOT based on the book bothered me throughout the film. The story deviates greatly from the book - fairly substantially in my opinion - and this results in a loss of the magic present in the book.\n\nThe movie alters the story in several key ways:\n\n1) One of the most important storylines from the book - the \"lost whistle\" - is virtually ignored in the film. This is one of the most important themes of the book and, in my opinion, it is a disservice to omit it from the film.\n\n2) The dramatic tension presented in the book between Hero Boy and the villainous boy disappears entirely in the film. This is likely due to the fact that the screenwriter decided to make Hero Boy AND the villainous boy the same character (something not done in the book). As such, the film lacks the conflict that makes the story so interesting.\n\n3) The \"answer\" to the Hero Boy's question about the \"bell\" and whether or not he hears it, is not as subtle (and clever) as it is in the book. This, again, is likely due to the fact that the filmmakers decided to drastically rewrite the story - however, it is to the detriment of the film.\n\nThese changes from the book, combined with the fact that the animation of the characters' faces looks fake (and sometimes creepy) and the fact that the musical score is sometimes overbearing, resulted in my enjoyment of the film being somewhat diminished.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not like I didn't enjoy the film - there are some truly magnificent moments in the film, and the visuals are astounding - but compared to the book, the film falls short. Had I not known that the film was based on a book (and a beloved children's book at that), I would likely have enjoyed the film more. But because I did know, and because I knew that the film departed so dramatically from the source material, I couldn't help but be somewhat disappointed.\n\nCertainly, this is a matter of personal opinion, and others may enjoy the film more than me.",
    " Even worse, the story has been seen before (and done better) in \"Stranger Than Fiction,\" which did a much better job of making its protagonist a sympathetic figure (and a better job of explaining the \"rules\" of the situation he was in), and whose final twist was far more clever and unexpected. Here, the \"surprise\" ending is telegraphed so far in advance, I was checking my watch, waiting for it to happen. collapsable spoiler outline\n\nIt didn't help that I found it hard to believe that a man so smart would be so dumb, and that a plan so complicated would be devised when a simpler approach would work. collapsable spoiler outline\n\nThe only performances of note are by Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano. collapsable spoiler outline\n\nThis is one of those rare films that I saw, and wished I had walked out of after the first five minutes. collapsable spoiler outline\n\nI cannot recommend this film. collapsable spoiler outline",
    " Beetlejuice is a fantastically unique film, a rare comedy that works on virtually every level. The setting is a haunted house, inhabited by a married couple, who die in a car accident, and are forced to haunt the house themselves when the new owners, a lively young couple, and their daughter arrive. When the new daughter, Maitland, plays a game of \"hide-and-seek\" and comes across a book about contacting the dead, Beetlejuice, the \"Bio-Exorcist\" arrives to scare away the living. However, Beetlejuice, who has a liking to the living, especially the girls, takes on a friendly role, much to the dismay of the Maitlands. A fantastic cast includes Alec Baldwin, Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder. The direction by Tim Burton is brilliant, and the movie is hilarious, with a great deal of variety and pace in the humor. The movie also has a very good horror element, with a dark atmosphere and some frightening scenes, especially the scene in which the daughter is possessed by an evil spirit. The movie also has a very good message, that of not being afraid to confront your problems, and not being afraid to die. A brilliant movie that is hilarious, scary, and thought-provoking, with a great performance by Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. This movie is a classic, and is a must-see for anyone who likes comedy or horror.",
    " This movie is electric. From the opening shot, it draws you in and never lets go. It's an emotional roller coaster that will have you rooting for Jerry Maguire by the end of the movie. This film also has one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie. Tom Cruise is brilliant as Jerry Maguire, and he makes the character his own. The supporting cast is also fantastic, with Renée Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Jerry O'Connell all giving great performances. This movie also has a lot of heart and is an excellent representation of the human condition. After watching this movie, you'll want to call everyone you know and tell them how much you love them. It's that kind of movie. I highly recommend it.",
    " The film follows the journey of a young African boy, Agu, who is forced to join a unit of mercenary soldiers after his family is killed. While the film's subject matter is harsh and brutal, its treatment is not. Rather than presenting a simplistic battle between good and evil, or victim and perpetrator, Beast of No Nation explores the shades of gray in between. Every character in the film, even the seemingly innocent Agu, has moments where their capacity for evil is revealed. This makes the film all the more powerful, as it forces the audience to confront the darkness that exists within all of us. \n\nThe film is not without its flaws. The dialogue is at times simplistic and cliché, and the plot can be difficult to follow. However, these flaws are overshadowed by the powerful performances of the cast, and the stunning visuals. \n\nOverall, Beast of No Nation is a powerful and thought-provoking film that explores the darkest corners of human nature. While it may not be for everyone, it is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",
    " While Notting Hill has plenty of laughs, they're all generated in a calculated way, as if the filmmakers weren't confident that the romance was enough to keep the movie afloat. And they're right. It isn't. The plot is terribly contrived, and the ending is a total cheat. As for the romance, it's paper-thin. Why these two crazy kids are attracted to each other is never explained. They don't have anything in common. She's a free spirit who doesn't care about material things; he's a jerk who evaluates women by the condo they live in. When he looks at her, he doesn't see the girl who lives in a garret and writes poetry. He sees a living room with no furniture.\n\nStill, Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant are so appealing that you might not mind. Both are expert farceurs who know how to underplay a line just enough to get the biggest laugh. They're also equally adept at the big, dramatic moments. When Grant yells at Roberts, \"You make me feel like a fool!\" it comes from the heart. Somehow these two manage to generate enough heat to make the movie work. If only they'd had better material to work with.\n\nNotting Hill generates enough goodwill that you might not mind its many imperfections. As the end credits roll, you might find yourself with a silly smile on your face. That's because the movie is content to be a trifle, and trifles are satisfying when done right. This one is done reasonably well.",
    " It's disgusting what directors Paul Greengrass and Laura Phillips have done with United 93. It's irresponsible and offensive, and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. This isn't a movie, it's an exercise in voyeurism, and anyone who pays to see it is as guilty as the filmmakers.\n\nUnited 93 depicts in grotesque detail the last hours of the four hijacked planes of September 11, 2001. This isn't a drama, not even a docudrama: it's a compilation of actual television news footage and crude re-enactments presented in documentary format. There are no actors, just look-alikes who resemble the terrorists who boarded the plane that day and flew it into the ground. There's no attempt to interpret or dramatize the events: just a relentless, 150-minute depiction of what happened, with each agonizing minute of the flight documented. Greengrass and Phillips don't even have the guts to show the crash – they just include actual news footage of the aftermath, over and over again.\n\nIt's one thing to honor the dead. It's one thing to present the facts. It's one thing to inspire a national feeling of solidarity, or even to promote patriotic sentiment. But United 93 is none of these things. Instead, it's a spectacle of suffering, a cheap thrill that exploits the memories of the dead and the feelings of the living. This isn't art, it's infotainment, and it's wrong.\n\nIt's tempting to see the fascination with which United 93 is made as a kind of perverse patriotism. Certainly the film is meant to be inflammatory: it depicts Muslim terrorists as ruthless, hate-filled killers, and it tries to stir up a feeling of righteous indignation about what happened. But the filmmakers forget that outrage is not the same thing as patriotism. Sometimes it's just outrage. And there's nothing patriotic about United 93: it's just an attempt to turn tragedy into propaganda, and it's shameful.\n\nIt's fascinating, in a way, that anyone would think this is a good idea. United 93 is a deeply unpleasant experience, and it will be seen by few people. But those few people will be influenced by it, and the implications of that are disturbing. There's a feeling of sickening fascination that comes from watching United 93, a feeling of complicity. That's precisely what the terrorists hoped to accomplish on September 11, and that's precisely what Greengrass and Phillips have accomplished with this film.",
    " As a child of the 80's, I really should hate this film, as it is the epitome of the kind of smarmy, cheesy, pop culture crap that defined that decade. But I can't. I love this film. There is something about it that is so damn charming and sweet, and the message is great for kids (and adults!) alike. Jack Black is hilarious and loves playing music, and you can't help but cheer for him as he inspires a group of prep school kids to form a rock band. From beginning to end, this film is clever, funny, and exciting. From the ridiculous situations the kids find themselves in, to the face-offs with the uptight, stuffy parents, this film is hilarious. The best part, though, is the awesome rock music that the kids play. All the songs are original and having been written specifically for the film, they fit perfectly within the story. If you like good music, you'll love this film. I gave this film only four stars instead of five because of one thing: Sarah Silverman. Sorry, but she just isn't very funny. Her character is pointless and her scenes just aren't funny. Other than that, though, this film is great. I highly recommend it.",
    " In an early scene of Martin Scorsese's 3-D children's film \"Hugo,\" an orphan boy named Hugo (Asa Butterfield) gets trapped inside the clock tower of a Paris train station, and the camera pans around him in a dizzying display of techno-wizardry. It's hard not to think of another Martin Scorsese movie, \"Taxi Driver,\" in which a character describes the nausea induced by riding a fairground carousel. Fairgrounds and circuses are places of both wonder and nausea, of illusion and reality, and Scorsese uses the 3-D here to explore those contradictions, to plunge us into the depths of Hugo's world and also to keep us at a distance from it. It's an appropriate choice, given the story's origins in a book by Brian Selznick (\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\"), which itself combines photographs and illustrations.\n\nThe story begins in a train station, where Hugo lives behind the walls with his faithful canine companion, Scorsese's camera swooping over the gears and wheels of a giant clock before landing on the boy's anxious face. The film then jumps back in time to tell Hugo's story, which begins in a dying town where he lives with his father (Jude Law), who repairs clocks. When his father is murdered by a mysterious man and presumably dies himself, Hugo escapes to the city, where he lives in the walls of the train station, stealing apples and avoiding the station inspector (Ray Winstone). Eventually, he is caught and nearly sent to an orphanage, but he manages to escape with the help of an eccentric toy shop owner named Georges (Ben Kingsley), whose goddaughter Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz) has a curious connection to Hugo's past.\n\nIt's a complex plot, and Scorsese directs with his usual fluency, shifting between past and present and moving his camera with infectious joy. The 3-D effect is sometimes subtle, sometimes showy, but it's always integrated into the storytelling. (It's never used to throw things at the camera, a relief.) The early scenes between Hugo and Isabelle are charming, and the movie is at its best when it sticks to the story of the two lonely children and the mysterious past they share. The story's solution to the mystery of Hugo's father's death is a letdown, however, relying on a deus ex machina and a conveniently placed notebook.\n\nBut the movie's true pleasures are more modest, including",
    " Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds spark this joyful, witty musical about Hollywood during the transition from silent films to talkies. With an unforgettable score featuring the classics \"Good Morning,\" \"Make 'Em Laugh\" and the title tune, this lively film is filled with dazzling dance numbers, priceless comedy and a lavish budget that took full advantage of the Technicolor process.\n\nDirector Charles Walters crafted a delightful, lighthearted story that humanized its pint-sized star, helped turn a forgettable Broadway musical into a bona fide hit, and launched the film career of a gyrating teenage phenom named Debbie Reynolds. Adding to the good vibrations are delightful performances by a top-notch supporting cast, including Millard Mitchel, Cyd Charisse and Leslie Peters.\n\n''Singin' in the Rain'' headlines some of the most entertaining performances ever filmed, from Kelly's effortless, engaging tap dancing to O'Connor's mesmerizing clowning.

At just 19 years of age, Reynolds delivers an irresistible performance as the movie-mad, vaulting-over-furniture, quick-with-a-quip dynamo who desperately wants to be a star.\n\nReynolds' aura is so intoxicating that it's hard not to root for her, and that's a large part of the movie's irresistible charm. While seasoned professionals like Kelly and O'Connor clearly know their way around a song-and-dance number, it's sheer pleasure to watch Reynolds steal virtually every scene in which she appears.

    " 'Hot Fuzz' is the best comedy of the decade!\n\nIt's always a thrill when a film crosses over and appeals to audiences young and old, male and female, and so on. Those kinds of movies are few and far between, and deserve recognition for achieving that kind of crossover success. Hot Fuzz is one of those films.\n\nHot Fuzz sends up just about every genre cliche there is, and polishes them off with witty dialogue and hilarious situations. The movie is a send-up of action films, and in particular those that feature an everyman who is forced, accidentally, into a situation where he has to fight an evil villain. The everyman usually finds himself promoted to a higher rank in the police force (promoted because he is the only one who can solve the mystery, uncover the conspiracy, and so on) and he is usually partnered with, or receives help from, an beautiful older woman.\n\nIn 'Hot Fuzz,' Nick Frost plays the everyman (PC Nicholas Angel), a bumbling, unassuming, yet honest policeman who is amazingly effective at his job. He's so effective, in fact, that he makes all of the other police in his small English town look bad in comparison. Nick is partnered with an beautiful, and somewhat mysterious, older woman (Danny DeVito, in a hilarious cameo) who helps him uncover a sinister conspiracy.\n\nThe evil villain is played by Jason Bateman, and it is a treat to watch him scheme and plot, and try to stay one step ahead of Nick. Can Nick save the day? Can he stop the evil mastermind from carrying out his dastardly plans?\n\nThere are so many great scenes and lines in this film, it's impossible to list them all. A few of my favorites include the scene where Nick is trying to shoot an assault rifle while riding a Segway, and the scene where he is trying to prove that a particular shopkeeper is really the evil mastermind.\n\nThis film appeals to everyone because it is populated with highly quotable lines, hilarious situations, and fun action sequences.

The characters are fun and relatable, and the bad guys are good antagonists to our heroes. This is the perfect movie for fans of sci-fi and action, and is suitable for all ages!",
    "The movie is a wild ride, and pulley is the right word. At times it feels like a pulley system has been set up between the audience and the movie, with the filmmakers pulling us along with them as they dive into the strange world of the military's experimentation with paranormal powers. It's a trip that takes us from the jungles of Iraq to the deserts of New Mexico, and it's full of odd characters and bizarre situations.\n\nThe movie's cast is top-notch. George Clooney is terrific as Lyn Cassady, a former soldier who's trying to make sense of his past. He's ably supported by an ensemble cast that includes Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges, Ewan McGregor, and Michelle Monaghan. Everyone seems to be having a good time, and it's infectious.\n\nThe movie's not without its flaws. At times the pacing feels a bit off, and the story can be a bit hard to follow. The military's paranormal program, which is the movie's premise, can be a bit hard to believe. But overall, \"The Men Who Stare at Goats\" is a fun, entertaining ride.",

    "There are films which attempt to tackle the interplay of ideology, greed, and self-interest and there are films whose depth and visceral imagery can only be matched by the ramifications of their subject matter. There Will Be Blood is one of the rare films that managed to impress upon me both simultaneously.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson achieves a cinematic nirvana in There Will Be Blood with a deep focus on the intricacies of human character and a steady detachment from the simplicities of plot. This is a film infused with philosophical heft and the weight of its own introspection, featuring a career-best performance from Daniel Day-Lewis, who is devastating in his portrayal of Daniel Plainview, and a mesmerizing turn from Paul Dano. It is a film suffused with Biblical allusions and an awe-inspiring score from Jonny Greenwood that sounds like nothing else. And it is a film of unforgettable moments, the canvas too broad for the finer details to ever fade from memory. A masterpiece.",
    "Now, understatement is not something you usually associate with horror films, especially the Korean variety. OTT bloodletting and sudden jump scares are more their style, with PTSD-induced screaming lurking around every corner.Debut director Jeong Hieronseok clearly has a more subtle approach in mind with \"Mother!\", an effective low-budget thriller that's more about generating a constant feeling of discomfort and dread verging on terror, like a histrionic horrorshow version of the Fab Four's \"Tomorrow Never Knows.\" And it mostly works, wading into nightmarish, Jordan Peele-esque territory where nothing is quite as it seems and madness seems to lurk just around the corner.\n\nWhen a pair of working mothers, Soo-jin and Young-seo, commute to the same child care center every day, they discover their babies have been switched, and a seemingly innocent mistake becomes a parental nightmare. Drawing comparisons to psychological thrillers like \"Married Life\" and \"Stranger,\" \"Mother!\" takes things several steps further, eschewing a convoluted plot in favor of atmosphere and anxiety ridden throughout. \n\nThe tension arises from the growing sense of uneasiness and dread between the two mothers as they try to figure out what happened. But, as the title suggests, is there a greater, more sinister force at play? The film works best when it focuses on the growing sense of paranoia and fear between the two women, with Hieronseok generating genuine chills without relying on cheap tricks or gimmickry. \n\nThis rising sense of terror continues until its bleak, bloody, and bitter end, with \"Mother!\" ensuring that the viewer is kept off-balance and on edge from start to finish. It's an effective, if somewhat derivative, approach that generates genuine chills, even though the ultimate destination will be disappointingly familiar to seasoned horror fans. \n\nSure, some of the twists and turns are a bit too conveniently coincidental, and the third act turns into a bit of a sillier spectacle than is advisable. But the commitment to creating a constant feeling of disquiet and dread is enough to carry the film, with some effective jump scares and a genuinely unsettling atmosphere. It's just a shame that the relative subtlety of its approach becomes overwhelmed by more histrionic tendencies in its final act.",
    "Based on a true story, \"Apollo 13\" details the near disaster that befell the Apollo 13 spacecraft on its journey to the Moon in 1970.

    "The movie merits praise for its portrayal of the humanity of its characters, regime gq who are richly drawn and relatable. It skillfully explores the emotional dynamics of personal relationships, and the challenges and sacrifices of pursuing a career in sports. The performances of Tom Cruise as Jerry Maguire and Renée Zellweger as Dorothy Boyd are authentic and compelling, bringing depth and dimension to their characters. \n\nThe film also shines a light on the greed and corruption endemic in the sports industry, and the moral dilemmas faced by those who choose to speak out against it. \n\nThe movie is not without its flaws, however. The runtime is overly long, and the musical score is often too loud and intrusive. Despite these flaws, \"Jerry Maguire\" is a thought-provoking and poignant film that will leave a lasting impression on viewers.",
    "DIRECTED BY Robert Zemeckis\n\n\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a dazzling blend of animation and live action that's as funny as it is clever.\n\nThe plot is just ridiculous enough to keep the movie firmly in the realm of cartoon logic, and the animation is state of the art, seamlessly blending with the live action segments.\n\nBob Hoskins gives a terrific performance as Eddie Valiant, the hard-boiled detective who finds himself plunged into the world of Toons, and who has to team up with Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) to solve the mystery of who framed Roger.\n\nThe movie is packed with laughs, from Eddie's constant squabbles with Roger to the hilarious antics of the other Toons, and the whole thing is tied together by a clever mystery plot that keeps you guessing right up to the end.\n\nThis is one of those rare movies that truly appeals to both kids and adults, and it's a real testament to the genius of Robert Zemeckis who directed it.",

This time, they're going up against someone who's almost equal to them in terms of sheer genius and athleticism: Daniel Ocean. Their plan this time revolves around a casino owner who's taking advantage of a loophole that allows him to launder money.

He is hired to provide dinner entertainment for a young woman, played by Jessica Biel, and her husband, played by Paul Giamatti. The woman is dissatisfied with her marriage and develops an obsession with Norton. \n\nThe film explores the themes of obsession, deception, and the line between illusion and reality. Norton's character is a compelling and complex figure, and the audience is left questioning whether he is a true illusionist or simply a man using his skills to manipulate those around him.\n\nThe film is beautifully shot and the performances of the lead actors are compelling. However, the plot is somewhat predictable and the ending is somewhat anticlimactic. Despite this, The Illusionist is a enjoyable and engaging film that will leave viewers thinking about the complexities of human relationships and the power of deception.",

    "This is an astonishing film from beginning to end, from its appropriation of Greek and Christian mythology to its utterly unexpected evolutions and twists.\n\n\"Ran\" is ostensibly a telling of the \"King Lear\" story, and in general those who have not read or seen that play will miss many of the most nuanced elements of this film, from the identities of the disguised characters to the ultimate fates of those who seem to survive.\n\nIn this version of the story, modeled closely on the play, Ran is a warlord who decides to divide his kingdom among his three sons. The eldest, Takakura, is to receive the land on which the castle is built, and the youngest, Jiraiya, is to receive the forest. The middle son, Saburō, is to receive nothing, although he will continue to live in the castle and serve his father. Ran's wife, Shiba, disagrees with this plan, and argues that the land should be divided more evenly. Ran accuses her of loving Saburō more than the other sons, which Shiba does not deny. Ran then accuses her of having wanted Takakura to have the castle, and Jiraiya the forest, stating that she evidently loves the land more than she does people. He also accuses her of having wanted Saburō to have received the sea, although they have no access to it. Shiba gasps that this is indeed what she wished, and Ran retorts that she has revealed her true self. He then announces that she will no longer live in the castle, and departs. Shiba commits suicide by throwing herself from the castle walls.\n\nAs in the play, the two older sons are untrustworthy, and the father misinterpreted the signs, including the apparent survival of a letter from his wife revealing that she did love Saburō most. Ran interprets this as meaning that she wanted Saburō to have the castle, which Takakura and Jiraiya take advantage of. Ran also believes that Saburō has inherited his mother's selfishness, and this does turn out to be the case--but in a much more nuanced and unexpected way than in the play.\n\nThroughout the film, the relationships among the three sons are more complex and compelling than in the play. Takakura is a withdrawn, quiet man who clearly has some understanding of his father's desires, and only barely escapes being tricked by his brother. Jiraiya is something of a loose cannon, clearly jealous of his brother",
    "The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a charming movie about a writer who embarks on a journey to learn about the Guernsey Island's history during the German occupation.

    "The film \"Memento\" is a unique and powerful story that explores the idea of memory and its fragility. The film's protagonist, Leonard, is struggling with a rare condition that causes him to have no short-term memory, and must rely on notes and tattoos to recall important information. This premise allows the film to delve into the idea that memory is not a reliable source of truth, and that it can be manipulated and distorted. \n\nThe film is structured in a non-linear fashion, with the story unfolding in a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards. This narrative technique serves to heighten the sense of disorientation and confusion that Leonard experiences on a daily basis. The audience is left to piece together the fragments of information presented, just as Leonard must do. \n\nThe acting in the film is top-notch, with Guy Pearce giving a compelling and sympathetic performance as Leonard. His dedication to the role is evident, and his portrayal is both nuanced and powerful. The supporting cast is also strong, with Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano standing out in particular. \n\nThe film's technical elements are also impressive.

    "In \"The Longest Yard,\" Burt Reynolds plays Paul \"Wrecking\" Crewe, a former pro quarterback who is sentenced to serve time in a prison called Fort Worth. Crewe is a notorious womanizer who has frequently used prostitutes, and while behind bars bristles at the regulations against such behavior. These habits eventually lead to a major confrontation with the prison warden, Hank Rafferty, played by Eddie Albert.\nRafferty is a truly despicable character, who will bend or break any rule to ensure that his prison provides him with a comfortable living, and he enjoys abusing his power by harassing the prisoners. His Lucius Malfoy-like mustache only adds to his general aura of sneering villainy. In an early scene where Rafferty is playing with two puppies, it becomes clear that, like Draco Malfoy, he is only good at caring for something when it is something that he can dominate and which cannot hope to hope him. Otherwise, he is happy to toss them aside, which foreshadows his treatment of the human characters in the story. \n\nThankfully, Crewe has earned the respect of the prisoners, and they follow his lead. They all cooperate to devise a plan to overcome their restrictive circumstances, resulting in a prisoner vs. guards football game that becomes the focus of the story. The stakes are high: if the prisoners lose, they have to wait another year for their next chance at freedom, but if they win, they get immediate parole.\n\nThe showdown is interesting, but the real attraction of this movie is watching two manipulative and powerful personalities go head-to-head. Crewe and Rafferty both enjoy being in control and resist being told what to do, and both are charismatic and aggressive. Yet they also resemble each other, leading to an ironic reversal near the end of the story where the once-arrogant Crewe desires nothing more than to become a loyal underling while the once-humble Rafferty seeks to seize control of a situation. \n\nThe movie's humor is consistent throughout, with several memorable one-liners and sight gags. The prison guard known as \"Nagler\" (who is excessively obsessed with football) is a memorable supporting character whose overly-specific rules infuriate the prisoners. Yet the movie's take on prison life is realistic enough that it does not glorify the prisoners' rebellion as some might complain about. The movie recognizes that the prisoners are mostly decent people who are unfairly treated, but it does not idealize them",

The result is a thrilling mix of action and romance that will keep viewers entertained from start to finish.\n\nThe film opens with a captivating scene in which Wolverine is seen battling deadly yakuza soldiers in a rain-soaked street in Japan. This sets the tone for the rest of the movie, which is filled with thrilling action sequences and beautiful cinematography. The fight scenes are particularly impressive, as they are well-choreographed and executed with a high level of intensity.\n\nThe film's plot is just as engaging as its action scenes.

He is drawn into a conflict between the Japanese government and a powerful criminal organization, and must use his skills and powers to protect the people he cares about and uncover the truth.\n\nThe film's cast is also top-notch. Hugh Jackman gives a stellar performance as Wolverine, perfectly capturing the character's raw power and emotion. Will Yun Lee is also excellent as the villainousNoburo Mori, and Tao Okamoto is captivating as the enigmatic Mariko.\n\nOverall, The Wolverine is a must-see for fans of the character and action-adventure films in general. It is a thrilling and emotionally powerful film that will keep viewers entertained from start to finish.",

    "The Men In Black are back and their latest mission involves infiltrating a secret weapons factory disguised as a hotel, to stop a madman who seems to be responsible for so much violence on Earth lately… I won't spoil any more of the plot! However it seems that not everyone is going his way, with some of his henchmen leaving or turning bad. It can get pretty dark at times too when evil-minded men try to do things like kidnap the U.S President's daughter. There's also some hilarious moments featuring your old buddy Tommy Lee Jones as the evil dictator; he keeps reminding you to take him seriously all to make you laugh every chance you get – until then, he's probably laughing maniacally at all those crazy explosions that go off. If there was a silver lining, well – I'd say it would be this brilliant score by Hans Zimmer that really does bring life to all these action scenes. I don't think I've ever seen anyone sound more menacingly epic than his, and his amazing cover of the Queen song makes perfect sense for an international spy film. Not to mention those unforgettable screams…\n\nAdvertisements",

He tries attending various film schools to prove he can speak his mind, while at home, he sees a screening of George Miller's action blockbuster, Mad Max: Fury Road (Mad Max being an inspiration for the villain in this upcoming installment). In front of him, and on a small screen, are Max Rockatansky, played by Tom Hardy; Immortan Joe- The leader known as Immortan Joe who gives Max his backstory as well as his title; Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron; Koba the gorilla- A talking animal with two guns named after him called Kiowa and Wotan; and Max himself...Max himself will become a main protagonist in Tom Hardy's second feature film as a mad-man's journey begins.\n\n\nMAD MAX: FURY ROAD was created a year prior to Fury Road by George Miller (The Dark Knight) and brought to life by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron based on characters from the novel\n\nand short story published by Mel Gibson. It received critical acclaim both critically, and commercially, and grossing over $800 million worldwide (as of 2017 - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1899340/?ref_=nl_bak_3 [IMDB] or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wJ9QCXj4x0 [Netflix]). However, according to IMDb, its status changed when it wasn't picked up for distribution - which may be the reason why it hasn't been made into a TV series.\n\n\nFrom the beginning, Fury Road features a complex narrative structured around three acts, each taking place between 1977's first film and 2015's sixth sequel, making use of flashbacks depicting the history of humanity before Max travels backwards through time across four decades.

    "A Clockwork Orange, directed by Anthony Burgess and based on his dystopian novel of the same name, is certainly on that short list of movies to put you in an existential angst situation as if you were one of those characters portrayed by Anthony Burgess or Philip Marlowe. This film, which was released in 1966, has been criticized for some of its brutal portrayal of violence in men and sexual cruelty towards women. But there's nothing wrong with making things violent or abusive, especially by turning them into robots and watching it over and over again or re-watching it whenever you want to become insane. That just adds to the overall fun atmosphere. In fact, this should be your first stop when getting into all kinds of alternative cinema!",

(view full review)\n\nThe text appears below.\n\nIt is a great honor to be able to share this review with you. I do realize that it is not easy to see these films made from the author's books. But if this is the best we can do, I believe that if a lot more people know about this, I believe that we can make a difference.\n\nHere is why I believe that we need help from the public:\n\nI have seen many, many films about the Holocaust including documentaries, from museums, PBS, even the PBS special \"Holocaust: An American Tragedy.\" These films are good. But it is their context that really matters. You must understand what life was like before and during the Holocaust; about the people who experienced it; and of course, what helped and hindered people from making it through.\n\nI see so many documentaries about the concentration camps, about the Holocaust from the perspective of survivors. They all have a similar ending but they all seem to end in a way different from my own. I don't just mean different in the way Jews are depicted from all sides, I mean that these \"tourists\" end up looking more impressed with themselves. They are not trying to learn more about the Holocaust, but I feel they are more self-congratulatory and proud when they end their documentaries with \"We survived.\" They don't realize that there were millions upon millions of Jewish people who did not survive the Holocaust of which they are mostly a part.\n\nI feel like these \"survivors\" aren't learning from their own experiences. You can only learn if you see.\n\nI have read many books about the War and the atrocities which it caused. They tell us a good part about the",

The story follows him as he trains with some of the best Chinese athletes in the country, including one of the most famous bodybuilders in the world, and eventually becomes the winner of the Mr. Universe competition. This film has been compared to \"Rocky IV\", but it's not quite that good. It's more like \"Rocky III\". There are some great action scenes, but they're all pretty much just set-pieces. I don't think this was really intended to be a serious film, so there isn't any real character development or anything like that. But if you want to see a good action film, then this might be worth checking out.\n\nI'm going to give this movie 3 stars because it does have some nice action sequences, but it doesn't really do much else. If you're looking for something more serious than \"Rocky IV\", then this probably won't be your thing.",

(this reviews focuses mostly on those aspects though).\n\n\nAs for animation itself we can safely say that Disney/Pixar created at their peak it's masterpiece in this area... Although there will always be people willing to criticize or criticize the way Pixar uses computer-generated graphics because by far they work the closest in terms of looking real; but if anything they even take some more things from Disney/Pixar's catalogue to use as well. (you'll notice they do have some characters that look vaguely familiar). What is actually really weird as the characters and environments aren't CGI, they are produced with a very thin layer of paint over them using the same technology which had existed for quite a while before this film even came along. It works pretty damn good. And just like any animated action sequence it does require attention at once as a lot of thought must go put together and this should not be taken lightly as there is a surprising amount of details, animations, and music used during certain scenes… especially as it will change between your three screens (three eyes are needed at times)… The animation itself is very fluid and easy to follow but there are also many special effects used throughout which add another level of realism.

It's running ahead.\n\nAfter the movie came out it was a bit frustrating for the hardcore fans of the comics that, for the first few weeks, the only way to get to the movie was to go to some random digital rental site. There hasn't been a huge amount of new material since the movie came out, so it's been hard to catch up to the movie. I did try to do my best and watch the whole thing through — but it's like there's a time limit: once that hour is up, the movie is over — and you have to move on to the next thing.\n\nWhat I figured out from my own experience is, if you want to watch the whole thing, you can't keep watching the previews. You need to go into the actual movie. This movie is like this, so I thought I'd use the time before the movie started to catch up on the back catalog. And if you're watching the movie on Blu-ray, it's actually going to be pretty easy to find all this stuff on Amazon and other digital rental sites.\n\nAnd it turns out this entire online experience will probably work better for most movie buff that the movie was trying to attract — because you can see all of that stuff all at once.\n\nThe movie is not a movie that's like, \"Get your geek on!\" It's a movie about the real thing. The movie is about being the first superhero team to start a superhero team and trying to do the next best thing to fight all the other superheroes that are trying to kill them, right now. The movie is about the team that they recruit to be the Fantastic Four, and they're the team who have to start from zero.\n\nIt's going to be a little more than the back catalog.

    "This movie was the last of the trilogy. It does not come to the conclusion of any of the stories, but ends them. The final film is very similar to the book in several aspects. The story involves Frodo and Bilbo encountering the evil wizard Gollum (played by Ian McKellen in this movie), an evil hobbit, trying to reclaim a ring. The battle between Gollum and Frodo is long and the ending is very emotional. The movie is very good as is the first picture.",

He must now travel to England to find out who killed him and why.\n\nWhat I Liked: The film was very well-written and acted. It had some great action scenes with lots of explosions and gunfights. There were also some nice character moments between the main characters.\n\nWhat I Didn't Like: The story seemed rushed at times. Some parts felt like they were just thrown into the middle of the movie without much thought or planning. Also, there wasn't enough explanation about what happened to the main character's family.\n\nOverall Rating: 7/10\n\nAdvertisements",
    "This is an excellent film, and I'm not just saying that because it's my favorite movie of all time. The story is simple enough to be understood by anyone who has seen the original, but the characters are so well-developed that you can't help but feel like you're in their shoes. It's a great comedy with some very dark moments, and if you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it now!\n\nI've been watching this movie since its release in 1998, and I still find myself laughing out loud at every joke. This is one of those movies where you'll laugh until your eyes hurt, and then you'll cry when you realize how much you laughed. If you don't have any idea what I mean by that, then you should probably stop reading right here and go watch the movie immediately.\n\nIf you want to know more about the plot, then read on…\n\nThe Big Lebowski is based on the novel of the same name written by John Turturro (who also wrote the screenplay). The book follows the adventures of Walter Sobchak, a man who lives in a small town called Colorado City, Arizona. He works as a barber, and he loves his job. However, he doesn't love his life, and he spends most of his days thinking about his girlfriend, Janey Slater. One day, while working at the barbershop, he meets a woman named Shelly, who introduces him to her boyfriend, Jeff Bridges. They become friends, and they spend most of their free time together.\n\nOne night, after a long day of work, Walter decides to take a walk around town. While walking down the street, he sees a sign advertising a bowling alley. He goes inside and orders a drink, which turns out to be a beer. After drinking the beer, he notices that there is no bartender. He asks the bartender if she needs anything, and she tells him that she does not need anything. Walter leaves the bar, and walks back home. When he gets home, he finds that his wife has left him. He tries to get angry at her, but he realizes that he cannot. Instead, he decides to make a deal with God. He will give up his soul to God if he can get rid of his wife.\n\nWalter makes a deal with God",
    "Sherlock in 'A Game of Shadows' (2007)\n\nThis may not qualify as a spoiler, I have only seen this one film though it was released a few years ago as an HD DVD that also had a digital transfer. The reason for this? For some strange reason I'm not sure I did like it.\n\nI was quite excited to see this movie. Sherlock Holmes has always been my favorite character and I love classic detective stories and movies on television. When Robert Downey Jr played Dr. Watson back in 2012 we got another iteration that didn't work for me but we still weren't too disapointed because he eventually replaced Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes in the 2015 Movie starring Benedict Cumberbatch. This new version in this movie made this movie a bit enjoyable. Both Cumberbatch and Mark Gatiss were really excellent performers although I felt their roles went out of kilter with what made Sherlock such a great character to begin with (like how both ended up being criminals). Even though Sherlock's personality seemed toned down I still enjoyed him overall but his role in the story wasn't as original or fresh as what we've seen so far in previous versions (and even more so than Gatiss'). And I actually liked the main villain even though he was overplayed at times which made up for certain things i think you'll agree with me. But that's just us so let's try and keep our expectations realistic anyway. My biggest problem with this whole production? I'm not crazy about the music/sound effects/etc that were put into this movie. So I'd rate this as average. Oh right there's other problems I mentioned earlier regarding sound. Other than that. It was funny and entertaining and was very well acted by David Boreanaz and Martin Freeman. We all should check out \"Sherlock\" if you enjoyed seeing John Watson from 'Sense8' in this modern day kind of way..if you enjoy modern-day thrillers then this may make your ears perk up!

    "I'm not sure what to make of this film, but I do know that it's one of those rare movies where you can't help but be impressed by its sheer audacity and ambition. It's an ambitious project with a lot going on, and while some of the ideas are interesting (the idea of a character who has no name, or a character who doesn't have a face), most of them seem like they were thrown together in a rush. But then again, there's something about the way director David Lynch approaches his work that makes me think he might just be able to pull off something truly special. The story follows a young man named Llewyn Davis as he tries to find himself after being diagnosed with schizophrenia. He meets up with a group of friends at a party, and things get out of hand pretty quickly. There's a lot of violence, sex, drugs, and general weirdness, but it all comes together into a very cohesive whole. This isn't your typical indie horror flick; it's more of a dark comedy than anything else. And if you're looking for a good laugh, you'll definitely want to check this one out.\n\nIMDB Rating: 7/10",

    "This film has been described as a thriller, but it's more like an action-thriller with some horror elements thrown in. The story follows a former CIA agent who goes undercover to protect his family and friends after he is framed for murder. He must fight off several enemies while trying to find out what really happened to him. This is one of those films that you can watch over and over again because there are so many different ways to approach it. It's not just about the plot or the characters, but also how they react to each other. There are plenty of twists and turns along the way, which makes this film worth watching multiple times.\n\nI'm going to give this film a solid 8/10. I think it's a great film that will keep you on your toes throughout. If you're looking for something new to watch, then this might be the perfect choice.",
    "This film has been described as a \"miracle\", and it's hard to argue with that description. It's not just a miracle, but an amazing one. The story follows a young man named David (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) who is diagnosed with cancer at age 17. He undergoes chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and after several months he begins to recover. But then his doctor tells him that he will need another round of treatment in order to save his life. After undergoing this second round of treatment, David finds himself back on the chemo table, and he soon discovers that there are some things you can't cure. This film is about what happens when you try to do something impossible.\n\nI'm going to be honest here; I didn't see this coming. I was expecting a generic horror/thriller/sci-fi flick, but instead I got a film that is both very unique and very compelling. There were times where I thought the film would end up being nothing more than a cheap thriller, but it never did. Instead, it became a fascinating look into the human condition, and how we deal with adversity.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this film is directed by none other than Steven Spielberg. If you haven't seen any of his films before, you should definitely check them out. They're all great movies, and they all have their own distinct style.\n\nIf you want to read my thoughts on the film, click here!",
    "This film has been described as a romantic comedy, but it's more like a love story with a twist. The main character (played by Jennifer Aniston) is an actress who gets married to a man she doesn't really know and then discovers that he's not her husband after all. She decides to keep their relationship secret until they're ready to get hitched. It's a very sweet and touching story about two people who are in love and want to be together. I think this would make a great movie for couples who have never gotten married before or those who just don't feel like getting married yet.\n\nI'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. This is a movie that could easily be made into a TV series. If only there were some way to watch it on Netflix!",
    "This film has been called one of the greatest animated films ever made, and it's not hard to see why. The story follows a young girl named Chihiro who lives in an isolated village with her mother and father. One day, she finds herself transported into another world where she meets a beautiful boy named Tatsuya. Together they embark on a journey that will change their lives forever.\n\nI have seen this movie twice now, once at the theater and again online. I was blown away by how much I enjoyed it both times. It's a very well-made movie, but it also manages to be very emotional. There are some scenes that really hit home, and there are others that make you feel like crying. This is definitely a movie worth seeing if you're looking for something different than what you've seen before.\n\nIf you want to read more about the movie, check out my review here.",

    "\n\nWoody Allen's latest film is a love letter to Rome, and it's a pretty good one. The movie is a series of vignettes, all set in Rome, and all featuring love in some form or another.\n\nThe vignettes are all connected in some way, but they're also all quite different. There's the story of a young man who falls in love with a prostitute; the story of an older man who falls in love with a much younger woman; the story of a married couple who rediscover their love for each other; and the story of a man who's in love with a woman who's in love with someone else.\n\nAll of the stories are enjoyable, and they're all funny in their own way.

    "\"Love & Mercy\" is a deeply moving portrait of a beloved music legend, Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys. The film brilliantly weaves the narratives of Wilson's life - his immense talent, his mental health struggles, and his issues with manipulative people around him - in an incredibly touching and powerful manner. \n\nThe film seamlessly switches between two significant periods in Wilson's life: the 1960s, where he was the driving force behind The Beach Boys' success while battling mental illness, and the 1980s, where he was living on a leash under the care of Dr. Landy. Paul Dano and John Cusack give stellar performances as the younger and older Wilson respectively. Dano captures Wilson's creative genius and the pressure that comes with it with poignant detail, while Cusack beautifully portrays an older, broken Wilson - terrified yet hoping for love and freedom.\n\nKudos to the director, Bill Pohlad for resisting the temptation to glamourize or sugarcoat Wilson's complicated life. The raw and unfiltered depiction of mental illness and the exposure of the dark side of the music industry make the film invaluable. Elizabeth Banks as Melinda Ledbetter, Wilson’s eventual wife, adds another dimension to the film. Her tender portrayal of a strong, caring woman who fights for Brian's freedom, gives the movie its much-needed hope and serves as an emotional anchor.\n\nSpecial mention must be made of Atticus Ross’s innovative sound design. He immaculately reproduces Wilson’s auditory hallucinations, giving the audience a peek into the musician's troubled psyche. \n\n\"Love & Mercy\" does not follow the conventional biopic formula, instead, it works as a tribute to a man who, despite his extraordinary talent and tragic struggles, survived and continues to inspire millions across the world. The film deserves applause for its honesty, compassion, and most importantly for reminding us that everyone, even the brightest star, sometimes need a bit of \"Love & Mercy.”\n",
    "\"Marie Antoinette\" is a visually stunning and stylistically unique interpretation of the infamous French queen's life. Director Sofia Coppola has taken a bold approach, infusing the 18th-century narrative with a modern sensibility that is both refreshing and daring. \n\nKirsten Dunst delivers a compelling performance as the titular character, embodying the naivety, extravagance, and eventual despair of Marie Antoinette with a nuanced depth. Her portrayal is not of a villainous queen, but of a young woman thrust into a role she was ill-prepared for, making her character relatable and human. \n\nThe film's aesthetics are undeniably its strongest point. The lavish sets, costumes, and cinematography are a feast for the eyes, capturing the opulence of Versailles in all its glory. The unconventional use of contemporary music, while jarring for some, adds a layer of youthful rebellion and energy that aligns perfectly with the film's perspective.\n\nHowever, \"Marie Antoinette\" is not without its flaws. The pacing can be slow, and the narrative lacks the dramatic tension that one might expect from a story leading to the French Revolution. The film's focus on the personal rather than the political may leave some viewers wanting more depth and context.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, \"Marie Antoinette\" is a bold and beautiful film that offers a fresh take on a historical figure often vilified. It's a cinematic experience that is as decadent and indulgent as the queen herself, and for those willing to embrace its unconventional approach, it's a film well worth watching.",
    "\"Shrek\" is a delightful animated film that has managed to captivate audiences of all ages since its release in 2001. The movie is a brilliant blend of humor, adventure, and romance, with a unique twist on the traditional fairy tale genre.\n\nThe film's protagonist, Shrek, is a lovable ogre who lives in a swamp and values his solitude above all else. However, his peaceful existence is disrupted when his land is invaded by a host of fairy tale creatures, leading him on a quest to rescue a princess in order to reclaim his home. The character of Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers, is wonderfully developed. He is gruff and intimidating on the outside, but beneath his tough exterior lies a heart of gold. \n\nThe supporting characters are equally memorable. Eddie Murphy's Donkey provides much of the film's comic relief, while Cameron Diaz's Princess Fiona is a refreshing departure from the typical damsel in distress. The villainous Lord Farquaad, voiced by John Lithgow, is both amusing and menacing.\n\nThe animation in \"Shrek\" is top-notch, with a vibrant color palette and meticulous attention to detail. The film's soundtrack, featuring songs by Smash Mouth and others, perfectly complements the on-screen action and adds to the overall enjoyment of the movie.\n\nWhat truly sets \"Shrek\" apart, however, is its clever and often irreverent humor. The film is filled with witty dialogue, visual gags, and numerous references to other fairy tales and popular culture, making it a joy to watch for both children and adults.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Shrek\" is a charming, funny, and heartwarming film that has stood the test of time. It offers a fresh take on the fairy tale genre, with memorable characters, stunning animation, and a fantastic soundtrack. Whether you're a fan of animation or just looking for a great movie to watch, \"Shrek\" is a must-see.",
    "\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", the fifth instalment in the Harry Potter Series, truly holds its ground and carries forward the legacy of the globally acclaimed franchise. Director David Yates has managed to deliver a visually stunning piece, filled with an assortment of emotions, ranging from elation to a deep sense of loss. \n\nIn terms of acting, the young ensemble once again shines with a notable increase in the depth of their performances. Daniel Radcliffe, as Harry Potter, brilliantly displays his character's maturing, showing signs of the weary hero facing increasing burdens. Furthermore, Imelda Staunton's Dolores Umbridge stands out as an impactful antagonist, ingrained in our memories with her zeal for wickedness concealed under a façade of polished politeness. \n\nThe special effects in \"Order of the Phoenix\" are enchanting, staying true to the fantasy genre with its magnificent CGI. From the Thestrals to the riveting wizard duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort, the visual effects add significantly to the magic and grandeur of the film. \n\nThe narrative gets darker, reflecting the rising threats and emotional turmoil faced by our lead characters. The script beautifully intertwines the central theme about the importance of hopeful defiance in the face of impending doom. The battles are not just with external forces, but also within, and this film does justice in portraying that struggle.\n\nIf there is one critique to be made, it would be that the movie often rushes through important plot points, perhaps due to the constraint of fitting a large amount of content from J.K. Rowling's fifth book into a two hour film. That being said, the essence of the story is not lost and freshness is maintained despite being a part of a long series.\n\nBeyond its grandeur and impeccable performances, the film stands tall as a piece of art that brings about the right emotions at the right time, giving one a rich, satisfying cinematic experience. It symbolises the bravery and resilience of adolescents faced with a changing world. A truly engaging watch for audiences of all ages, this movie is a wonderful blend of magic, conflict, friendships, and a subtle reminder of the inevitability of growing up.",
    "\"The Woman in Black\" is a chilling, atmospheric horror film that successfully revives the classic gothic ghost story. The film is set in a remote English village, where a young lawyer, played by Daniel Radcliffe, is sent to settle the affairs of a recently deceased woman. The eerie, desolate setting is a character in itself, contributing to the overall sense of dread and unease that permeates the film.\n\nRadcliffe delivers a solid performance, effectively shedding his Harry Potter persona to portray a man haunted by both literal and figurative ghosts. His character's growing fear and desperation are palpable, making the audience share in his terror. The supporting cast also does a commendable job, adding depth to the story without detracting from its central mystery.\n\nThe film's greatest strength, however, lies in its ability to create suspense. Rather than relying on cheap jump scares, \"The Woman in Black\" builds tension gradually, using unsettling imagery and a haunting score to create a sense of impending doom. The titular Woman in Black is a terrifying presence, her appearances marked by a palpable shift in atmosphere.\n\nThe film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the story to unfold slowly and giving the audience time to become invested in the characters. The plot is engaging, with enough twists and turns to keep viewers guessing until the end. The climax, while somewhat predictable, is nonetheless satisfying and leaves a lasting impression.\n\n\"The Woman in Black\" is not without its flaws. Some may find the pacing too slow, and the plot relies heavily on genre tropes. However, these minor issues do not detract from the overall experience. The film is a well-crafted, genuinely scary ghost story that pays homage to the classics of the genre while offering something new and unique.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Woman in Black\" is a must-see for horror fans. It is a testament to the power of atmosphere and suspense in creating fear, proving that a good ghost story can be just as terrifying as any slasher film. With its strong performances, engaging plot, and genuinely creepy atmosphere, \"The Woman in Black\" is a standout entry in the horror genre.",
    "\"U-571\" is a thrilling, action-packed World War II drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The film is set in the heart of the Atlantic Ocean, where a group of American submariners are tasked with a daring mission to capture a German Enigma machine. \n\nThe film's strength lies in its ability to create a palpable sense of tension and claustrophobia, effectively capturing the fear and uncertainty that comes with submarine warfare. The underwater sequences are particularly well-executed, with the director using a combination of tight shots and atmospheric lighting to create a sense of impending doom. \n\nThe ensemble cast, led by Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, and Harvey Keitel, deliver strong performances. McConaughey, in particular, shines as the young and inexperienced Lieutenant who is thrust into a leadership role under the most challenging circumstances. His transformation from a hesitant officer to a decisive leader forms the emotional core of the film.\n\nHowever, \"U-571\" is not without its flaws. The plot, while engaging, is riddled with historical inaccuracies that may irk some viewers. The film takes significant liberties with the facts, most notably the fact that it was actually the British, not the Americans, who captured the first Enigma machine. \n\nDespite these inaccuracies, \"U-571\" succeeds in delivering a suspenseful and engaging war film. The intense action sequences, solid performances, and high-stakes drama make it a must-watch for fans of the genre. While it may not be a historically accurate representation of events, it is a gripping and entertaining cinematic experience.",
    "“Elysium” is a thought-provoking and visually splendid foray into a dystopian future, rendered with the precise direction of Neill Blomkamp. Set in 2154, where the stark division between the rich and poor is painstakingly apparent and the socio-political subtext resonates loud and clear, the film keeps you riveted with its spectacular world-building.\n\nMatt Damon delivers a compelling performance as the desperate hero, Max, whose life hangs by a thread and is torn between saving himself or humanity at large. The distinctive physicality he brings to the role complements his natural charisma, making us root for him every step of the way.\n\nOn the other hand, Sharlto Copley's villainous Kruger is undeniably impactful. Copley, with his raw and sometimes chilling portrayal, provides a worthy adversary to Damon's Max. Their intense confrontations make for some of the film's most memorable moments.\n\nJodie Foster, in the role of the cold and calculating Secretary Delacourt, gives a performance that is classic Foster: measured, nuanced, and undeniably powerful. However, it is the film's visual effects that steal the show. From the sleek and clean utopian space station Elysium to the gritty and grim Earth, the imagery is nothing short of stunning.\n\nHowever, the movie does struggle with pacing and narrative efficiency. While the first half sets up an engrossing universe, the second half becomes somewhat cluttered, with plot threads not receiving the closure they deserve. \n\nThe social commentary presented here is potent, but its delivery often strays into the realm of heavy-handedness. At times, the screenplay tends to oversimplify the complex themes it wishes to navigate, which slightly undermines the film's overall impact.\n\nDespite these creases, \"Elysium\" remains a largely successful venture thanks to its captivating premise, strong performances, and spectacular visual effects. It is a bold commentary on class struggle and the distribution of wealth that will strike a chord with those receptive to its message, while also offering a visually arresting cinematic experience to casual viewers.",
    "\"Twilight\" is a film that has managed to capture the hearts of many, especially the younger audience, with its unique blend of romance, fantasy, and teenage angst. The movie, based on Stephenie Meyer's best-selling novel, introduces us to the world of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), a seemingly ordinary girl who moves to the small town of Forks, Washington, and falls in love with the mysterious Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), who happens to be a vampire.\n\nThe film's strength lies in its ability to portray the intensity of teenage love and the lengths one would go to protect their loved ones. The chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson is palpable, making their forbidden love story believable and engaging. The supporting cast, including Billy Burke as Bella's father and Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen, also deliver commendable performances.\n\nThe cinematography is another highlight of \"Twilight\". The lush, green landscapes of the Pacific Northwest are beautifully captured, creating a perfect backdrop for the story. The film's score, composed by Carter Burwell, complements the narrative well, adding depth to the emotional scenes.\n\nHowever, \"Twilight\" is not without its flaws. The dialogue can be cheesy at times, and the special effects, particularly the vampire speed and sparkle, leave much to be desired. The pacing is also uneven, with some scenes dragging on longer than necessary.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, \"Twilight\" is a captivating film that successfully brings Meyer's novel to life. It's a must-watch for fans of the book series and those who enjoy a good love story with a supernatural twist. While it may not appeal to everyone, its charm is undeniable, making it a memorable entry in the realm of teen romance films.",
    "“The celluloid adaptation of Harper Lee's poignant and powerful novel, \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is nothing short of a cinematic triumph. The movie, much like its literary counterpart, is an admirable exploration of grave societal issues enveloped in the facade of an innocent and charming small-town setting. \n\nGregory Peck is magnetic in his portrayal of the virtuous lawyer and single father, Atticus Finch. Peck beautifully captures the dignity, kindness, and quiet strength of the character. His Oscar-worthy performance resonates in every scene, especially in his stirring courtroom monologue, which stands as one of the finest moments in cinema history. \n\nThe supporting cast contributes strongly as well, namely Mary Badham as the curious and outspoken Scout. Her genuine performance adds considerable depth to the narrative. Brock Peters, as the accused Tom Robinson, the embodiment of injustice and prejudice, too shines brilliantly, evoking empathy and outrage.\n\nOne cannot ignore the deft hand of director Robert Mulligan in capturing the essence of the American South of the 1930s, seamlessly juxtaposing its dreamy innocence with its lingering darkness. The black-and-white cinematography perfectly complements the plot's gravitas, painting a visually impactful picture of the era.\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is a masterfully created film that compels you to introspect the harsh realities of societal prejudices and discrimination. The film’s narrative and its multidimensional characters remain etched in your mind long after the credits have rolled. It's an evocative and stirring narrative that continues to speak volumes about its timeless themes. A must-watch for lovers of insightful, intelligent cinema!”",

The film is a rollercoaster of emotions, taking the audience on a journey through the highs and lows of Mercury's life, from his humble beginnings to his rise to stardom and his tragic death.\n\nRami Malek's portrayal of Freddie Mercury is nothing short of extraordinary. He embodies the flamboyant and charismatic persona of Mercury with such conviction that it's easy to forget you're watching an actor and not the rock icon himself. Malek's performance is a testament to his dedication and talent, and he truly deserves all the accolades he has received for this role.\n\nThe film's narrative is well-structured and engaging, providing a balanced mix of drama, humor, and heartbreak. The script is sharp and insightful, offering a nuanced portrayal of Mercury's complex personality and relationships. The film doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of Mercury's life, including his struggle with his sexuality and his battle with AIDS, which adds depth and authenticity to the story.\n\nThe music, of course, is a highlight of the film. The iconic Queen songs are woven seamlessly into the narrative, serving as a powerful backdrop to the unfolding drama. The Live Aid concert sequence is particularly impressive, recreating the electrifying atmosphere of the original event with stunning accuracy.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, and Joe Mazzello, deliver strong performances, each bringing their respective characters to life with depth and nuance. The film's production design, costumes, and makeup are top-notch, effectively transporting the audience back to the 70s and 80s.\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is not just a film for Queen fans, but for anyone who appreciates good cinema. It's a poignant and inspiring tribute to one of the greatest rock icons of all time, and a testament to the enduring power of music. Despite its runtime of over two hours, the film never feels long or tedious, thanks to its engaging narrative and captivating performances.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is a must-watch film that offers a compelling and deeply moving portrayal of Freddie Mercury's life and career. It's a film that will make you laugh, cry, and sing along to some of the greatest rock anthems of all time.",
    "\"Bridget Jones's Diary\" is a delightful and relatable romantic comedy that will surely win the hearts of its viewers. This film amazingly captures the essence of modern-day romantic struggles through its flawed yet endearing main character, Bridget Jones, portrayed brilliantly by Renee Zellweger.\n\nZellweger absolutely shines in her portrayal of Bridget. She strikingly captures the charm, vulnerabilities, and insecurities of her character that make her so much more than just a stereotype of a single woman. With her disarming honesty, Bridget Jones becomes a character that many people, not just women, can identify with.\n\nThe script, based on Helen Fielding's novel of the same title, is intelligently adapted to the big screen. It encapsulates the humor and wit from the book while cementing its own identity as a film. The story is filled with hilarious gaffes that will keep you laughing out loud and regretting every moment you've ever sympathized with Bridget's dire situations.\n\nThe supporting cast is also to be applauded. Hugh Grant gives an impeccable performance as the charming yet undependable Daniel Cleaver, and Colin Firth is sublime as the stoic and somewhat aloof Mark Darcy.

This impassioned plea for peace and unity is a testament to Chaplin's storytelling prowess and remains one of the most powerful moments in cinematic history.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Paulette Goddard and Jack Oakie, deliver commendable performances, adding depth to the film's narrative. The cinematography is top-notch, with each frame meticulously crafted to enhance the storytelling.\n\n\"The Great Dictator\" is a testament to Chaplin's genius as a filmmaker. It is a film that is as relevant today as it was when it was first released, reminding us of the power of cinema to challenge societal norms and inspire change. Despite being over 80 years old, the film's message continues to resonate, making \"The Great Dictator\" a timeless classic that deserves to be seen by every generation.",
    "\"Windtalkers\" is a war film that superbly blends action and drama with an often overlooked aspect of World War II. Directed by the talented John Woo, this film delves into the use of Navajo code talkers in the Pacific theater.\n\nThe narrative focuses chiefly on Navajo Marines who were trained to use their language as a code, creating an unbreakable encryption for radio messages during the battle against the Japanese. The film showcases the relationship between the code talkers and their bodyguards, tasked with the uncomfortable mission to protect the code at all costs.\n\nThe performances in this movie are top-notch. Nicolas Cage leads the cast as Sergeant Joe Enders, delivering a lethal mix of intensity and internal struggle.

Together, they bring to life the complexity of their characters' relationship in the face of war and duty, adding layers to the film's narrative.\n\nThe battle scenes are well-executed, exhibiting John Woo's signature action sequences. However, it's the social tensions and a profound exploration of war ethics that makes \"Windtalkers\" stand out. It paints a harsh picture of the cultural misunderstandings, discrimination, and conflicting loyalties that were a part of the World War II era. \n\nAlthough some may argue that the film oversimplifies parts of the history or focuses too heavily on the battle scenes, it must be appreciated for shedding light on the often overlooked contribution of the Navajo Nation during WWII. Some scenes seem to lack depth and fleshed-out details, but overall, it is a memorable film.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Windtalkers\" is a well-crafted war movie that combines riveting action with an intriguing, lesser-known slice of World War II history. Despite its shortcomings, it's an engaging and thought-provoking film - definitely worth a watch for war movie enthusiasts and history buffs alike.",
    "\"This is The End\" is an anything-goes apocalyptic raucous comedy with a plethora of Hollywood stars. As one of the most hysterically funny films I've seen in a while, this movie is infused with genuine laughs from start to finish. Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson - all play skewed versions of themselves to comedic perfection. \n\nThe story invites us to a wild party at James Franco's house where celebrities are reveling hard not realizing that the apocalypse is about to happen. What follows is a relentless journey of wit, surprises, and extensive comedy. The comic timing of the ensemble cast is truly impressive and their performances are just as hilarious and outrageous as one might expect.\n\nThe script does not shy away from vulgarity and it even pushes the envelope of crude humor for many. However, the crassness only adds to the hilarity of the situations. The premise of the film is outlandishly absurd yet brilliant. \"This is The End\" successfully blurs the line between reality and fiction, using the real personas of the actors to create a fun mockery of Hollywood's excesses.\n\nThe unexpected cameo appearances are sure to delight viewers, adding another dimension to the fun. Add to that some brilliantly crafted CGI sequences involving a certain dark lord for a visually impressive treat.\n\nWhile on one hand, it has an unashamedly ridiculous plot, on the other it provides social commentary through its comedy by addressing the rampant egotism in Hollywood and our society's obsession with fame.\n\nTrue, \"This is The End\" might not be everyone's cup of tea due to its bawdy humor and controversial religious themes. However, the movie is funny consistently at a rate that puts other comedies to shame. It is unrepentantly non-PC and brilliantly blunt - a riot with every line having the potential to become the punchline. An entertaining cataclysm that brings the end of the world wrapped in laughter. It's indeed a unique kind of joyride through chaos for those who appreciate its brand of humor.",
    "\"The Birth of a Nation\" is a film that is as controversial as it is historically significant. Released in 1915, it is a silent epic drama directed by D.W. Griffith that has been both praised for its technical innovations and criticized for its overtly racist content and glorification of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe film's narrative is a sweeping tale of two families during the Civil War and Reconstruction era, showcasing the tumultuous period in American history with a grandeur that was unprecedented at the time. The storytelling is compelling, and the performances, particularly by Lillian Gish and Henry B. Walthall, are commendable. The film's technical achievements, including its use of close-ups, cross-cutting, and other editing techniques, were groundbreaking and have influenced countless films since.\n\nHowever, it is impossible to discuss \"The Birth of a Nation\" without addressing its deeply problematic racial politics. The film's portrayal of African Americans is offensive and dehumanizing, and its romanticization of the Ku Klux Klan is disturbing. These elements make the film a challenging watch for modern audiences and have rightly earned it a place of infamy in film history.\n\nDespite these issues, \"The Birth of a Nation\" is an important film to study for its technical innovations and its role in the development of narrative cinema. It is a stark reminder of the deeply ingrained racism of its time, and its continued controversy serves as a testament to the power of cinema to shape, reflect, and challenge societal attitudes.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Birth of a Nation\" is a film that cannot be ignored, but must be approached with a critical eye and an understanding of its historical context.

Directed by Ridley Scott, the film is a testament to his ability to create visually stunning and emotionally resonant pieces of cinema.\n\nRussell Crowe delivers a powerhouse performance as Maximus, a Roman general who is betrayed and reduced to slavery. Crowe's portrayal is both physically and emotionally intense, capturing the audience's empathy as he fights for survival and revenge.

Phoenix's performance is chilling and captivating, making Commodus a character you love to hate.\n\nThe film's production design is nothing short of spectacular. The recreation of ancient Rome is breathtaking in its detail and scale, immersing the audience in the grandeur and brutality of the era. The action sequences, particularly the gladiatorial battles, are expertly choreographed and filmed, providing thrilling spectacle without sacrificing character development or narrative coherence.\n\nThe film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is another standout element.

    "\"Tropic Thunder\" is an explosive comedy that is loaded with outrageous laughs from start to end. Navigating the treacherous terrain of Hollywood, Robert Downey Jr., Ben Stiller, and Jack Black deliver standout performances that perfectly capture the overblown egos and eccentric personalities of the movie industry.\n\nThe movie is a brilliant satire of the Hollywood machine, cleverly poking fun at actors, agents, producers, and the entire filmmaking process. Downey Jr.'s portrayal of method actor Kirk Lazarus is particularly commendable - despite the controversial nature of the character, he manages to pull off his role with an uncanny blend of humor and criticism, creating a character who is both memorable and thought-provoking.\n\nAs a director, Stiller shows a keen understanding of the genre he is lampooning, masterfully crafting over-the-top sequences that hilariously mimic blockbuster war movies. Yet beneath the film's humour, \"Tropic Thunder\" offers cutting commentary on Hollywood's commodification of war and suffering for box-office success. It also addresses the industry's treatment of actors, particularly those with mental disabilities, in a way that is both irreverent and eye-opening.\n\nThe ensemble cast is fantastic, each contributing to the comic mayhem with aplomb. Tom Cruise's surprise role as the ruthless movie producer is a particular highlight, offering a departure from his usual roles that is as unexpected as it is hilarious. The interplay between characters is impeccably timed, adding to the chaotic energy that makes this film such a riotous fun.\n\nDespite its humorous facade, \"Tropic Thunder\" is a cleverly written critique of Hollywood that doesn't pull its punches. Its ability to balance biting satire with belly laughs is testament to the sharp wit of its writers. While its humor might be considered offensive by some, there's no denying the film's daring approach and its readiness to push the envelope.\n\nAt its core, \"Tropic Thunder\" is a wild and uproarious ride that serves up plenty of laughs while making poignant observations about the film industry. It's a standout comedy that isn't afraid to poke fun at its own industry, making it a must-see for film aficionados and casual viewers alike.",
    "I recently had the pleasure of watching the 2005 film adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved children's book, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\" Directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, this movie brings new life to the classic tale of a young boy who wins a golden ticket to visit the mysterious chocolatier's factory.\n\nOne of the standout elements of the film is its visual effects. The fantastical world of thefactory is brought to life in vivid detail, with bright colors, whimsical designs, and imaginative set pieces that will captivate viewers both young and old. The Oompa Loompas, played by Deep Roy, are particularly memorable, with their intricate dance numbers and catchy musical interludes.\n\nJohnny Depp brings his signature quirkiness to the role of Willy Wonka, making him both charming and slightly unhinged. His performance adds depth to what could have been a one-dimensional character, and he inhabits the role completely, from his wild hair and makeup to his exaggerated mannerisms.\n\nThe child actors in the film also deliver impressive performances, especially Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket. He conveys the sense of wonder and excitement that we all experience when faced with something magical, and his chemistry with Depp is undeniable. The other child actors playing the spoiled brats who win the other golden tickets are equally impressive, with each one bringing their own unique personality to their roles.\n\nThe themes of kindness, generosity, and the importance of following your dreams shine through in this film, reminding us that even in the face of adversity, hope can still be found. Another theme that stands out is how parents' behavior affects children - Charlie's father works hard to provide for his family but doesn't show much affection, while the other children's guardians spoil them rotten instead of setting boundaries, which results in obnoxious kids with no regard for others. Those subtle lessons, along with some commentary on the consequences of technology add",
    "\"Ford v Ferrari\" is a thrilling and entertaining ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The film tells the story of Carroll Shelby, an American car designer and driver who is recruited by Ford Motor Company to build a racecar that can beat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race.

    "I recently watched \"Born on the Fourth of July\" for the first time, and I must say, it's a truly powerful and thought-provoking film. The movie tells the story of Ron Kovic, a young Marine who returns home from Vietnam paralyzed and disillusioned, and his struggle to come to terms with the trauma he experienced during the war.\n\nTom Cruise delivers an incredible performance as Kovic, bringing depth and nuance to a character that could have easily been reduced to a caricature. His portrayal of Kovic's anger, frustration, and sense of betrayal is both heartbreaking and infuriating, and he carries the film's emotional weight with ease.\n\nThe supporting cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Willem Dafoe and Kyra Sedgwick. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the bleakness and desolation of Kovic's hometown and the stark contrast between the idyllic American dream and the harsh reality of war.\n\nWhat struck me most about this film is its relevance to contemporary society. Despite being released in 1989, \"Born on the Fourth of July\" feels just as relevant today as it did back then. The themes of disillusionment, the cost of war, and the struggle for social justice are just as pertinent now as they were then, and the film's message is just as powerful.\n\nOverall, \"Born on the Fourth of July\" is a masterful film that is both a powerful anti-war statement and a poignant portrait of the human cost of conflict.

    "Pacific Rim is a thrilling science fiction adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The special effects are stunning, with sprawling cityscapes and massive monsters that seem to leap off the screen. But this film is more than just mindless destruction - it has a beating heart and a cast of memorable characters that make it truly unforgettable.\n\nThe story takes place in a future where humanity is under attack by Kaiju, towering creatures that have emerged from a portal beneath the ocean. To combat these monstrous threats, humans have developed Jaegers, giant robots piloted by humans who must work together in perfect sync to take down the Kaiju. Our hero, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), is a former Jaeger pilot who is brought back into the fold when his brother dies in battle. Alongside rookie pilot Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), he must learn to work together with their new teammates to defeat the escalating threat of the Kaiju.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of Pacific Rim is its diverse cast. Hunnam and Kikuchi deliver strong performances as the lead duo, but they're joined by a talented supporting cast including Idris Elba, Charlie Day, and Ron Perlman. Each actor brings their A-game, making even the smaller roles feel fully fleshed out and compelling.\n\nBut let's face it - the real star of the show is the action. Director Guillermo del Toro knows how to craft a fight scene like no other, and the battles between the Jaegers and Kaiju are nothing short of breathtaking. With each successive battle, the stakes are raised, and the tension becomes almost unbearable. You'll find yourself cheering aloud as the Jaegers take on the Kaiju in bruising, bone-crunching battles that seem to go on forever.\n\nWhat really sets Pacific Rim apart, though, is its themes of hope and sacrifice. This isn't just a mindless action romp - it's a film about working",

The story follows Charlie, a shy and introverted teenager, as he navigates the challenges of high school and tries to find his place in the world.\n\nOne of the things that struck me most about this movie was the cast of characters. Each person was so well-developed and relatable, and the actors brought their roles to life in a way that felt so genuine. Logan Lerman's portrayal of Charlie was particularly impressive - he captured the vulnerability and insecurity of a teenager struggling to fit in, and his delivery of the character's inner monologues was incredibly moving.\n\nThe relationships between the characters were also superbly done. The dynamic between Charlie and his new friends, Sam and Patrick, was especially compelling. Their bond was so strong and supportive, and their interactions were filled with humor, warmth, and a sense of belonging that was so touching to watch.\n\nThe plot of \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" is largely character-driven, and it tackles some heavy themes like mental health, abuse, and the struggles of growing up. The movie does an excellent job of balancing these darker elements with moments of humor and joy, creating a final product that feels both realistic and uplifting.\n\nIn addition to its strong characters and storytelling, \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" also boasts a fantastic soundtrack. The music was expertly curated and added another layer of depth to the film, transporting me back to the 90s and immersing me in the world of the characters.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" to anyone who enjoys coming-of-age stories, stellar acting, and a good dose of nostalgia. It's a beautifully crafted film that will make you laugh, cry, and feel all the feels in between.",
    "Spike Lee's \"BlacKkKlansman\" is a powerful and timely film that delivers a urgent message about the state of race relations in America. The film tells the true story of Ron Stallworth, a black police officer who infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s, and it does so with a perfect blend of humor, drama, and activism.\n\nThe cast is phenomenal, with John David Washington delivering a breakout performance as Stallworth. He brings a level of charisma and depth to the role that makes it impossible to take your eyes off him. Adam Driver also shines as Flip Zimmerman, the Jewish cop who goes undercover with the KKK, and the chemistry between the two leads is electric.\n\nThe film's pacing is quick and engaging, moving seamlessly from comedy to intense drama and back again. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the bleakness of Colorado Springs in the 1970s and the eerie atmosphere of the KKK gatherings. The score is equally impressive, perfectly capturing the mood of each scene.\n\nWhat really sets \"BlacKkKlansman\" apart, however, is its unflinching commentary on racism and white supremacy. The film pulls no punches in its depiction of the KKK's hate-fueled ideology and the violence that accompanies it. It's a difficult watch at times, but it's a necessary one. Lee doesn't shy away from showing the audience the brutal reality of racism and the ways in which it continues to permeate our society today.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the film is its relevance to contemporary issues. From police brutality to white nationalist rallies, \"BlacKkKlansman\" feels like it was made for this exact moment in time.

    "Sure, here's a review of \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\":\n\nWes Craven's 1984 classic \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" is a seminal horror film that continues to terrify audiences to this day. The movie introduces us to Freddy Krueger, a supernatural serial killer who haunts the dreams of his victims and brutally murders them in their sleep.\n\nThe film's premise is simple yet effective: a group of high school students, all children of the parents who burned Krueger alive, are stalked and killed in their dreams by the vengeful spirit of Freddy Krueger. The movie's strength lies in its ability to tap into our deepest fears and insecurities, exploiting the idea that we are most vulnerable when we're asleep and unable to defend ourselves.\n\nThe performances of the young cast are convincing, particularly Heather Langenkamp's portrayal of the resourceful and determined Nancy Thompson. Robert Englund's iconic performance as Freddy Krueger is chilling and unforgettable, and his menacing presence looms large over the entire film.\n\nThe film's Visual and practical effects hold up surprisingly well even by today's standards, with some of the nightmare sequences still managing to induce goosebumps. The iconic scene where Freddy's glove extends its razor-sharp blades is still a standout moment in horror cinema.\n\nThe movie's score and sound design also contribute to its eerie atmosphere, with the haunting theme music and Freddy's distinctive chuckle becoming synonymous with horror. The film's use of jump scares and tension builds is expertly crafted, keeping the viewer on edge throughout.\n\nOne of the most praiseworthy aspects of \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" is its subtext. The film's exploration of themes such as the consequences of revenge, the power of dreams, and the vulnerability of teenagers is remarkably mature and thought-prov",
    "Sure, here's my attempt at writing a review for the movie Hercules:\n\nI went into this movie with low expectations, and unfortunately, it did not exceed them. The story was predictable and lacked depth, the acting was subpar, and the action scenes were overly reliant on CGI. Dwayne Johnson, who plays the titular character, is certainly physically impressive and has a charismatic presence, but he cannot carry a movie on his own. The supporting cast, including Ian McShane and Rufus Sewell, were underutilized and their talents were largely wasted.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with the film is that it takes itself too seriously. It tries to be a gritty, realistic retelling of the classic mythology, but ends up feeling like a poor imitation of Gladiator or 300. The script is clunky and lacks any real emotional resonance, making it difficult to care about what's happening on screen. Even the climactic battle scene, which should have been epic and thrilling, felt dull and uninspired.\n\nOverall, I would recommend skipping Hercules and watching one of the many better movies in the sword-and-sandal genre instead. Despite its potential, this film falls flat and fails to deliver on its promise of exciting action and adventure.",
    "I recently watched \"Meet the Parents\" for the first time, and I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish. The movie tells the story of Greg Focker, a young man who meets his girlfriend's family for the first time, and the hilarious culture clash that ensues.\n\nThe cast is absolutely fantastic, with Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro delivering standout performances. Stiller plays Greg, a likable but awkward nurse who is trying to make a good impression on his girlfriend's family. De Niro is perfectly cast as Jack Byrnes, the overbearing and intimidating father of Greg's girlfriend, Pam. The chemistry between the two actors is electric, and their interactions are some of the funniest moments in the movie.\n\nThe supporting cast is also great, with memorable performances from Blythe Danner as Pam's mother, Dina, and Owen Wilson as Greg's friend, Kevin. The entire cast works well together to create a believable and hilarious portrayal of a family in all its dysfunctional glory.\n\nOne of the things that sets \"Meet the Parents\" apart from other comedy movies is its ability to balance humor and heart. The movie is laugh-out-loud funny, but it also has a lot of heart and warmth. The characters are well-developed and relatable, and the movie has a lot of insight into the complexities of family dynamics.\n\nThe direction by Jay Roach is also noteworthy. He does a great job of pacing the movie and keeping the jokes coming at a rapid-fire pace. The movie never feels slow or draggy, and Roach's use of physical comedy and slapstick humor adds to the overall humor of the film.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend \"Meet the Parents\" to anyone looking for a funny and entertaining movie. It's a classic comedy that holds up well even after multiple viewings, and it's a great introduction to the Focker family franchise.",
    "Sure! Here's a review of the movie \"Warcraft\":\n\nI went into this movie with low expectations, having heard mixed things from critics and friends. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The visual effects were stunning, with beautifully rendered environments and creatures that looked like they jumped straight out of the video game. The acting was also solid, with standout performances from Travis Fimmel as the rugged warrior Anduin Lothar and Toby Kebbell as the complexity-laden orc leader, Durotan.\n\nOne of the things that impressed me most about this movie was the way it handled the source material. As a fan of the Warcraft games, I was worried that the film would simplistically adapt the storylines and characters, resulting in a lackluster experience for fans and non-fans alike. However, the movie managed to take the rich lore of the games and expand upon it in interesting and unexpected ways. The addition of new characters and plotlines only added to the depth and complexity of the world, making it feel fresh and exciting even for those familiar with the franchise.\n\nThe pacing of the movie was also well-handled, with a quick-moving first act that efficiently established the stakes and characters, and a thrilling third act that kept me on the edge of my seat. The only misstep was the somewhat sluggish second act, which felt like it dragged on a bit as the characters journeyed through the portal to the orc world. However, this was a minor complaint in an otherwise well-crafted movie.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend \"Warcraft\" to fans of the games and fantasy movies in general. It's a visually stunning, action-packed film that manages to effectively adapt the source material while also adding new elements to the world. Even if you're not familiar with the franchise, it's an enjoyable and immersive cinematic experience that's well worth the watch.",
    "I just watched \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" and I'm still trying to process my thoughts about this film. It's a masterclass in storytelling, with a unique blend of dark humor, heartbreak, and social commentary that will leave you both entertained and uncomfortable.\n\nThe film follows Mildred Hayes, a grieving mother who rents three billboards to call attention to her daughter's unsolved murder case. Frances McDormand delivers a powerhouse performance as Mildred, bringing depth and complexity to a character that could have easily been reduced to a one-dimensional caricature. Her raw emotion and determination are palpable throughout the film, and she's supported by an impressive cast that includes Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell.\n\nThe film tackles some heavy themes, including police brutality, racism, and the way society treats women. It's not afraid to confront these issues head-on, but it also doesn't offer any easy answers. Instead, it presents a nuanced portrayal of small-town America, where people's lives are complicated by their own prejudices and personal demons.\n\nOne of the things that struck me most about this film is its ability to balance tone. The subject matter is certainly dark, but the film finds ways to inject moments of humor without ever diminishing the gravity of the situation. It's a delicate balancing act, but director Martin McDonagh pulls it off beautifully.\n\nCinematographically, the film is stunning. The use of color and composition creates a stark, haunting atmosphere that perfectly captures the mood of the story. The score is equally effective, complementing the visuals without overpowering them.\n\nOverall, \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" is a thought-provoking, visceral experience that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It's not always comfortable to watch, but it's essential viewing for anyone interested in exploring the complexities of human nature and modern American society.",
    "This film is a masterpiece. The acting, directing, and historical accuracy are all superb. I was on the edge of my seat even though I knew how the story would end! Ron Howard did an amazing job bringing this incredible true story to life in such a powerful way.\n\nThe special effects are impressive, but what really shines through is the human element - you feel like you're along for the ride with these astronauts, getting a sense of what they had to go through during their ordeal. All three leads deliver outstanding performances that will leave you breathless. Tom Hanks has never been better as Jim Lovell, embodying his character's quiet strength and determination perfectly; Bill Paxton steals every scene he's in as Fred Haise Jr., injecting much-needed humor into tense moments without taking away from their gravitas; Ed Harris gives one of cinema history's greatest supporting turns because of his haunting portrayal of Gene Kranz (the real Gene Kranz himself called Harris' performance \"scary\" accurate), capturing both his no-nonsense leadership style while still allowing glimpses beneath his hard exterior showing why Apollo 13 Mission Control team remained so fiercely loyal towards him throughout everything they went through together, too...and let's not forget Gary Sinse who makes chilling work of his small role by giving us goosebumps each time he speaks due to his heartfelt delivery.\n\nThis film should be mandatory viewing in schools across America - anyone can learn something here about resilience & resolve when faced against insurmountable odds! We owe so much gratitude towards brave men like these three astronauts and thousands others whose contributions made projects like Apollo possible: They inspire us today just as much now as they did back then & continue challenging us strive higher than ever imagined possible before them!",
    "I recently watched \"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\" with my family and was left feeling underwhelmed. The movie follows the adventures of Manny, Sid, and Diego as they encounter a group of dinosaurs who are trying to survive in a world that is rapidly changing due to global warming.\n\nOne of the biggest issues I had with the movie was the lack of a compelling storyline. The plot felt predictable and unoriginal, with the characters facing one challenge after another without much depth or development. The dialogue was also cheesy and lacked the witty humor that made the first two movies so enjoyable.\n\nAnother problem I had with the film was the character of Sid. In the previous movies, Sid was a lovable and goofy character who provided much of the comedic relief. However, in this installment, he was reduced to a whiny and annoying sidekick who constantly got on my nerves. His antics were not funny or endearing, and I found myself rolling my eyes every time he spoke.\n\nThe animation was also a letdown. While the first two movies featured beautiful and detailed animations, \"Dawn of the Dinosaurs\" seemed to have a more cartoonish and exaggerated style. The characters looked less realistic and the environments were not as detailed or immersive.\n\nOne of the few bright spots in the movie was the voice acting. The cast, which includes Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary, did a fine job with the material they were given. However, even their performances couldn't save the movie from its overall lackluster quality.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed with \"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\".

    "The Birds is a classic horror film that still holds up today, despite being released over 50 years ago. The story is simple yet effective: a young woman named Melanie Daniels visits a small California town and discovers that the local birds have begun attacking people, with increasingly violent and deadly results.\n\nWhat makes The Birds so effective as a horror movie is its slow-burn tension and atmospheric setting. The film takes place in a picturesque coastal town, where the peaceful sounds of the ocean and chirping birds create a sense of tranquility that is slowly shattered as the bird attacks become more frequent and brutal. The film's use of sound design is particularly effective, using eerie bird noises to build suspense and creating jump scares that are still startling today.\n\nTippi Hedren gives a star turn as Melanie, the socialite who finds herself caught up in the chaos. Her character's development from a selfish prankster to a resourceful survivor is compelling, and her chemistry with co-star Rod Taylor adds an extra layer of depth to the film. The supporting cast, including Jessica Tandy and Veronica Cartwright, also deliver strong performances.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of The Birds is how director Alfred Hitchcock uses symbolism throughout the film. The birds themselves represent different things at different times - fear, violence, nature's fury - but they always remain unsettling and menacing. Additionally, the film can be seen as a commentary on society's relationship with technology and our reliance on it; the climactic scene set inside a phone booth is particularly allegorical.\n\nOverall, The Birds is a must-see for horror fans and cinephiles alike. It's a masterclass in tension and atmospheric building, with a standout performance from Tippi Hedren and impressive direction by Hitchcock. While some viewers may find certain aspects of the special effects dated (the obvious use of fake birds and green screen), these minor flaws do nothing to detract from the overall impact of the film. In short, The Birds is a timeless horror classic that will leave you",

I went into it not knowing much about it, other than it was a sci-fi horror movie starring Vin Diesel, and I was blown away by how much I enjoyed it.\n\nThe story is set in space, where a group of passengers on a spaceship are forced to make an emergency landing on a remote planet after their ship is damaged in a meteor shower.

The special effects are impressive, especially considering the movie's relatively low budget, and the creature designs are genuinely terrifying. The cast is also great, with standout performances from Vin Diesel and Radha Mitchell.\n\nOne of the things that sets \"Pitch Black\" apart from other horror movies is its unique setting. The fact that the movie takes place on a remote planet with no sunlight, and where the creatures can only come out at night, adds an extra layer of danger and isolation to the story.

    "I just watched \"Hail, Caesar!\" and I'm still trying to process what I just saw. This movie is a wild ride from start to finish, and I'm not entirely sure if it's a genius work of art or a complete disaster.\n\nThe film follows Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), a fixer for Capitol Pictures, as he navigates a series of absurd and hilarious events in 1950s Hollywood.

    "I just watched Nacho Libre for the first time, and I'm still trying to process what I just saw. This movie is like a trainwreck that you can't look away from - it's simultaneously horrifying and mesmerizing.\n\nI went into this movie blind, knowing only that it starred Jack Black and was directed by Jared Hess (of Napoleon Dynamite fame). I have to admit, I was expecting something more along the lines of a goofy, lighthearted comedy. What I got was something else entirely.\n\nThe plot follows Nacho (Black), a cook at a Mexican orphanage who moonlights as a luchador (a Mexican wrestler) in order to raise money for the orphans. There are so many things wrong with this premise, but somehow it manages to work anyway. The writing is bizarre and often confusing, with characters making seemingly random appearances and disappearances throughout the film.\n\nBut the real magic happens when Nacho steps into the ring. The wrestling scenes are some of the most absurdly entertaining moments I've ever seen on screen. Watching Jack Black prance around in his impossibly tight pants, tossing himself through the air and delivering over-the-top monologues had me laughing out loud despite myself.\n\nAnd yet, there's something strangely heartfelt about this movie too. It's clear that everyone involved was having a blast making it, and their enthusiasm is infectious. You can't help but feel good watching these misfits come together and pursue their dreams, no matter how ridiculous they may be.\n\nOverall, Nacho Libre is a strange and beautiful creature - equal parts dumb comedy, surreal fever dream, and genuine feelgood story. If you're feeling adventurous and want to watch something truly original, give it a shot. Just don't say I didn't warn you!",
    "I recently watched \"The Blind Side\" for the first time, and I was blown away by this incredible true story. The film tells the tale of Michael Oher, a homeless teenager who is taken in by a wealthy family and goes on to become a star football player.\n\nOne of the things that struck me most about this movie was the performances. Quinton Aaron, who plays Michael, gives an outstanding debut performance. He brings such vulnerability and depth to his character, making it impossible not to root for him. Sandra Bullock also shines as Leigh Anne Tuohy, the fierce and determined mother who takes Michael under her wing. She played the role with so much passion and conviction that it's easy to forget you're watching an actress play a part rather than the real person herself.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally impressive, particularly Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy, Leigh Anne's husband. Their chemistry on screen feels genuine, which only enhances the heartwarming nature of their characters' relationship. And let's not forget the real-life NFL stars who make appearances throughout the film! It's surreal seeing them appear onscreen alongside the actors portraying them.\n\nWhat impressed me even more than the acting was the way the story was told. It would have been easy for the writers to sensationalize certain aspects of Michael's life or focus solely on the football element, but instead, they opted for an approach that highlights the human side of the story. We get glimpses into the struggles both Michael and the Tuohys face along the way, which keeps the narrative grounded and relatable. Even if you know how events ultimately unfold, there are plenty of unexpected moments peppered throughout the runtime – meaning that suspense still abounds!\n\nI must admit, I got pretty emotional during several scenes. It just warms your heart to see people coming together to help someone who needs it without expecting anything in return. Of course, not everything runs smoothly all of the time; some moments pack a serious punch. Ultimately though? It’s hard not be inspired after watching “The Blind Side.” For one thing, I",
    "\"We Were Soldiers\" is a powerful and emotionally charged film that takes a raw and unflinching look at the realities of war. The film tells the story of the Battle of Ia Drang, the first major conflict between American forces and the North Vietnamese Army during the Vietnam War.\n\nThe film's strength lies in its ability to put the viewer right in the midst of the action, giving a visceral and intense portrayal of what it was like to be a soldier in this brutal and bloody conflict. The battle scenes are intense and chaotic, with bullets flying in every direction and explosions erupting all around. The sound design and special effects are top-notch, creating a sense of immersion that makes you feel like you're right there on the battlefield.\n\nThe performances in the film are also standouts, with each actor delivering a convincing and nuanced portrayal of their character. Mel Gibson gives a particularly powerful performance as Colonel Hal Moore, the commander of the 1st Cavalry Division's 1st Battalion. He brings a sense of gravitas and authority to the role, and his leadership and compassion for his men is inspiring.\n\nOne of the things that sets \"We Were Soldiers\" apart from other war movies is its focus on the human cost of war. The film doesn't shy away from showing the brutal reality of combat, but it also takes the time to explore the emotional toll that war takes on the soldiers and their families. The film's final act, which follows the aftermath of the battle and the impact it had on the soldiers and their loved ones, is particularly powerful and emotionally resonant.\n\nOverall, \"We Were Soldiers\" is a masterful and impactful film that is a must-see for anyone interested in the Vietnam War or the human experience of combat. It's a powerful tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of the soldiers who fought in this conflict, and a reminder of the devastating consequences of war.",

    "My favorite film of 1997.\n\nAfter seeing this film twice, I can honestly say that if there is a better film for 1997, I haven't seen it. I was actually surprised by the fact that the movie could actually be seen as something other than simply propaganda for the black civil rights movement, but rather the movie is in fact a strong reflection of what \"life\" during a slave revolt was really like and an insight into how the courts viewed such actions. It portraits each of the people involved in this historic 19th century incident and gives equal time to showing each of their backgrounds and actions, in a way that is not only very fair, but which shows the audience the different, and sometimes conflicting, sides of the arguments taking place.\n\nThe entire cast is outstanding, from Anthony Hopkins as a racist and hypocritical abolitionist, Matthew McConaughey as the Southern plantation owner who defended the accused, Djimon Honsou and the other members of the crew as they attempt to communicate and escape, as well as the powerful role of Morgan Freeman as the counsel for the African crew members. The screen is so full of activity, all the time, that it does not seem to drag a bit. From the time the Africans land in America to the time they're finally released, there's nearly a feeling of breathlessness as they go from one legal hearing to another with a variety of outcomes.\n\nThis is not a movie that just preaches to the black community about how they were abused as slaves. Rather, it is the story of a small group of people whose fate became intertwined with 19th century American society, at a time when people were either for slavery or against it. Because of those two sides, the case was not an easy one, and, as we see in the film, the final outcome was quite a surprise.\n\nEveryone who is a fan of Morgan Freeman ought to see this movie, as he did a truly outstanding performance as the attorney for the African slaves.\n\nHighly recommended.",
    "I'm not sure what to make of this film, but it was certainly interesting and thought-provoking. It has been compared with Hitchcock's \"Psycho,\" which seems like an odd comparison since they are so different in tone and style. But both films have a similar theme - that there may be something wrong with you if you don't fit into society's mold. In \"Psycho,\" Norman Bates is a psychopath who kills women because he thinks they are trying to seduce him; in \"Unbreakable,\" David Dunn (Bruce Willis) discovers that he can't die after being hit by lightning during a train wreck. Both men feel isolated from others because their behavior doesn't conform to social norms.\n\nThe difference between these two characters lies in how each deals with his situation. While Norman becomes increasingly unstable as time goes on, David learns to accept himself for who he really is rather than try to change himself into someone else. This makes sense given that one character lives alone while another spends most of his life surrounded by people who love him dearly. However, even though David accepts himself more readily than Norman does, neither man ever fully understands why things happen as they do or whether there might be some greater purpose behind them all.\n\nThis lack of understanding leads both men down dark paths where violence becomes inevitable. For example, when Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson), a comic book collector turned supervillain, tries to kill David using glass shards embedded under his fingernails, we see just how far he will go before giving up hope entirely. Similarly, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) decides to become Batman instead of continuing his career as a lawyer, we witness firsthand how much damage he causes along the way. Neither hero nor villain truly knows what motivates them until too late.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Unbreakable\" offers us insight into human nature through its exploration of themes such as isolation, identity crisis, and self-acceptance. Although it isn't perfect, it remains worth watching simply because it raises questions about our own existence without providing easy answers.",
    "This film was one of those rare movies that you can watch over and over again, and still find something new to appreciate about it each time. It's not just an entertaining story; it also has some very interesting ideas behind it. For example, what if your entire life were being broadcast on television? What would happen when people started watching you all day long? How would they react to seeing someone who looks like them but isn't really there at all? These questions are explored in this fascinating drama starring Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a man whose whole existence seems designed around making him happy. But he doesn't know why... until now!\n\n## Plot Summary\n\nTruman Burbank (Jim Carrey) lives his life under constant surveillance by cameras hidden throughout his hometown of Seahaven Island. He believes himself to be living out a normal existence with friends and family members nearby, unaware that everything happening around him is actually part of a massive reality show called \"The Truman Show.\" When Truman discovers the truth, however, he decides to leave town forever - only to discover that no matter where he goes, he cannot escape the reach of the producers controlling his every move.\n\n### Cast & Crew\n\nDirector: Peter Weir\nWriters: Andrew Niccol (screenplay), Peter Weir (story)\nStars: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich",
    "I've just watched this film and found it disappointing, but was going to rate three stars after that because my childhood memories can not be unclouded by time. Then in an odd way I saw why George Lucas decided to write and direct his vision at all costs instead of letting someone else do so with him only giving pointers here and there as needed. He truly wanted to take us back to A New Hope once more for one glorious last time. This may have been what he envisioned when making his rough ideas known during concept drawings for A New Hope years earlier; however the end result left less impact on me than did its predecessor ESB and yet still somehow it makes the original trilogy stand strong as a whole on a storyline basis if nothing else. That would depend greatly where you look at it though since many were disappointed with how EEP ended up being, myself included which doesn't mean these movies weren't fun to watch over again each spring break growing up near them both here in California...even into college! Perhaps now days only those who grew-up around their releases will appreciate what they actually had tried setting down upon this silver screen before audiences today could see anything special about any part of either films themselves…which might also explain why many complain so strongly against today’s pop culture icons anyway while forgetting why anyone cared enough then (and even after) watching new episodes come out every few years along side older ones being released onto home video formats like VHS tape then DVD/Blu ray disc eventually too! Maybe we should go back further first though? It may help some understand better…maybe even ourselves inside us too because sometimes it takes looking back far enough without judgment or blame added onto us later from others outside our control either way no matter how much they want things done differently than before despite best intentions towards creating something good overall regardless whatever happened between said persons involved otherwise. No worries though right? After all there are billions more around planet earth waiting patiently already for another chance like this second opportunity given freely just so long nobody else tries changing ANYTHING along line again anytime soon thankfully right?! Yeah I don't think we need anymore reminders telling everyone why exactly does change scare people so often besides fear itself usually meaning everything else always falls apart faster whenever doing different than normal times",
    "## User Reviews\n\non 21 October\n\nIt's not that horrible at least. There are some good parts that made me think it could've had a promising sequel. I wasn't impressed with anything I've seen yet. It was decent enough to see how bad IMDb readers would react to this as if it was a new low instead of what they really expected: a complete disaster...which this was not...not yet anyway.\n\nThis was not bad. It had all the elements of a good movie: a villain, a love interest, a few funny moments, some great action scenes, and a ton of CGI and special effects. The movie had fun characters, but like the others (that aren't Marvel) they are kind of weak and uninteresting. The main villain, Joker, is nothing special, which makes you wonder why they even chose him to be the main villain. I think we could have seen more of his back story and maybe what drives him. There are too many cheesy jokes throughout the movie, making the characters all look like caricatures, instead of real people. They need to work on the dialogue and characters, as well as the story.\n\nThis was a poorly made movie. I think Warner Brothers tried to make the movie like \"The Dark Knight,\" but that's where they went wrong. It was kind of a mishmash of \"Man of Steel\" and \"Batman Begins\" with a few good quips from the humor of the \"Justice League.\" It didn't mesh well, it just seemed forced and cheap. The villain was generic as could be. He just wasn't evil enough to warrant a Joker role and it didn't live up to what the audience had hoped for. It was all a little disappointing. I wish this had more potential, but I don't think it had any potential.\n\n## Trivia\n\nWonder Woman's (Gal Gadot) Amazonian costume has a pair of sandals that she wore while she lived on Themyscira. She's the only one who wears them.\n\nThe first time we see Wonder Woman jump in slow motion, she's throwing her sword right into a bunch of thugs.",
    "I was at my local Video Store renting for the weekend and noticed in their new releases section, just sitting on top, as if it was begging to be taken down, sat From Dusk Till Dawn, so noticing Salma Hayek's name also caught me eye. Now this is how stupid guys like us are (myself included): we see an attractive female lead actress or two and automatically assume that our favorite horror movie will have nudity with gore! Well guess what? My theory is still upholded. :)\nMy initial reaction when starting FDTD was WOW. How can you follow Bruce Campbell from EVIL DEAD 2?? It just wasn't possible at first because Bruce made his mark (so did Sam Rami), but Geof Duffy and Quentin Tarantino make the cut easily; I give them props for making such a killer film which they clearly enjoy themselves while viewing the story evolve into its own kind of mythology; which by the way would probably never happen again unless some director out there feels that vampires need rehabilitation for one reason or another. Eitherway; the movie grabs your attention right off the bat once you hear 'Hey Jack!' - you know it's going to get pretty rough from then onwards. Tarantino takes no prisoners here really he just plows through blood in every scene and in almost every shot as well; so much fun, yet a little weird even, seeing George Clooney (ER) play a cold-blooded Mexican Bandit robbing banks and killing everyone who stands in his path. Then he encounters Kate Hudson as an underage prostitute with only her mother for support. You feel sorry for her character as you watch these two characters bond throughout the whole movie. But something terrible always seems to happens to people with great personalities and bad luck (Kate Hudson). So the gang moves onto a strip club before midnight arrives where strange things and unexpected events begin appearing as time passes quickly towards daylight. What really makes this film work overall though isn't the writing (although, I must say very good); the dialogue between Seth (Clooney) being sarcastic with Richie(Pulaski) being witty) it certainly has a cult classic comedy atmosphere about itself. This is accomplished",

    "> Goon, also called The Fighter from Quebec in the UK edition, makes up for having no big name actors with a high quality script that focuses more on entertaining its audience that puffing itself and actors' egos. It was fun to see Michael Rooker reappear after 35 years playing minor roles; this may help his career since last time he played such an important role was way back when he had major supporting roles as Merle on Walking Dead series. A real sports crowd pleaser - it gets you right into their world where the hockey players get beaten bloody or concussed but still come out on to the ice as if nothing happened - some good scenes, some bad ones (like the fight scene between Doug and Xavier), and many with interesting dynamics - like the whole family being there watching Patty play (saw some similarities here in other films and TV shows dealing with young athletes). Great cinematography of actual hockey games and arena fights and excellent direction overall. Some say it lacked action but remember this isn't Hollywood so expect less violence but more plot development - it has a great storyline about love and family support which helps move things along nicely without getting too much blood or gore going around.

    "This film was an absolute delight to watch, and it's one that will stay with me for quite some time. It has everything you could want in a period piece - beautiful costumes, gorgeous sets, wonderful acting, and a storyline that keeps your attention throughout.\n\nI have always been fascinated by magicians, so this film really appealed to my interests. Eddie Redmayne plays Eisenheim, a young man who grew up as an orphan but learned how to perform magic tricks at a very early age. He becomes famous all over Vienna because he can do things no other magician can do. His fame attracts the attention of Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), who wants him to use his skills to help him win back Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel). She is engaged to be married to another man, but she still loves the prince. When Eisenheim performs a trick that makes her believe he knows what she did on their first date together years ago, she falls in love with him instead. This causes problems between the two men, especially when the prince finds out about the relationship.\n\nEisenheim also catches the eye of Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) who suspects there may be something more going on than just simple magic tricks. As Eisenheim continues performing around town, people begin disappearing after seeing him perform. One night while performing at a theater, Eisenheim meets up with Sophie again and they share a kiss before leaving separately. Later that evening, Sophie goes missing and everyone assumes she ran away with Eisenheim. However, Uhl believes otherwise and begins investigating further into Eisenheim's past. What follows next is a series of events that lead to both men trying to find each other before anyone else does.\n\nThere are many reasons why this film works so well. First off, the cast is excellent across the board. Each actor brings something special to their role which helps make them stand out among others. Secondly, the direction by Neil Burger is superb. He uses every shot wisely and never lets anything go unnoticed. Thirdly, the script written by Steven Knight is brilliant. There isn't much dialogue here but what little we get is used effectively. Finally, the cinematography by Darius Khondji is stunning. Every scene",
    "\"Corpse Bride\" follows the events leading up to The Wedding scene in Tim Burton's \"Sleepy Hollow.\" Victor Frankenstein's (voiced by Johnny Depp) journey of being a man and marrying his sweetheart Victoria (played by Emily Watson) was very entertaining. His journey of being married to the lovely, but dead, Emily (voiced by Helena Bonham-Carter) is equally enjoyable.\n\nThe only problem I had with this film was with it's length. It was short and could have used a bit more of the story that it did have. The animation for the wedding song and dance was superb though, it was a true highlight of \"Corpse Bride.\"\n\nThe music that I enjoyed the most was in the opening credits and during Victoria's wedding sequence; it really set the tone for the entire movie. I enjoyed the music more than I did the actors, although I also enjoyed the voice cast for their roles. Helena's voicing as Emily was my favorite, but Depp as Victor was also very fitting (he did the voice for the skeleton, but they used a different skeleton for the movie, so don't expect Johnny).\n\n\"Corpse Bride\" is an interesting concept, but is a bit dark for the young ones.\n\nI think a more mature audience will enjoy this film more, but the young ones might be a bit scared. If you like the animation of Tim Burton, as I do, then this movie is for you.",
    "I'm not sure what to make of this film, but it was certainly entertaining and original in its own way. It has some very good moments that are quite scary (the scene with the tape recorder being one), but there were also times when I felt like laughing at how ridiculous everything seemed. This may be because I have seen so many horror films before, or maybe just because I am used to seeing more realistic ones. Either way, I think this film will appeal mostly to people who enjoy campy B-movies.",
    "This film was an excellent portrayal of Ian Curtis' life and his band Joy Division, but it wasn't perfect. It did not show how he met Deborah (his wife) or how they got together. Also, there were some scenes that seemed to be out of place in the storyline. For example, when Ian goes into the hospital after trying to commit suicide by hanging himself with a belt, he has a conversation with a nurse about how she thinks he should have killed himself because he would never get better. This scene didn't seem necessary at all; it just made me feel bad for him even more than before! Another thing that bothered me was how much time was spent on showing us what happened during their last tour instead of focusing on other parts of their lives such as family life or friendships outside music etc.. Overall though this movie was very well done overall despite these few flaws which could easily be overlooked due its greatness otherwise!!",
    "The film opens in 1984, when Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt) meets journalist Daniel Molloy (Christian Slater). He tells him his story about how he became a vampire and what happened to him since then. In 1790s New Orleans, Louis was a young plantation owner who had lost everything after the death of his wife and child. One night, he met Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise), an aristocratic Frenchman who turned him into a vampire. They lived together as lovers until they were separated by fate. After that, Louis spent many years alone, but finally found someone else like himself - Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), a little girl whom Lestat made immortal. But their relationship soon changed...\n\nThis adaptation of Anne Rice's novel has been criticized because it doesn't follow the book closely enough. However, this isn't really true; there are only minor differences between them. For example, in the book, Louis kills Armand (Antonio Banderas) at the end instead of letting him live forever. Also, some scenes have been added or deleted for dramatic effect. Overall though, most fans will be pleased with this version. It captures all the main elements of the original story while adding its own touches here and there.\n\nOne thing that sets this apart from other vampire movies is its focus on character development rather than action sequences. There aren't any big battles or chases through dark alleys. Instead we get long conversations between characters where they talk about love, loss, loneliness etc.. This makes sense considering that these creatures don't need guns or swords to kill people anymore. All they need is their fangs!\n\nAnother interesting aspect of this film is its use of flashbacks. We see events happening both before and after Louis becomes a vampire. These help us understand why certain things happen later down the line. For instance, we learn why Louis hates sunlight so much. Or why he refuses to drink human blood even though he craves it constantly.\n\nFinally, let me say something about Tom Cruise's performance. Many critics claim that he overacts throughout the entire picture.",
    "The Woman in Black is a brilliant adaptation of the stage play of the same name and an entertaining, edge-of-your-seat, frighteningly good movie. It stars Daniel Radcliffe as Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer in the early 1900′s who needs to go to the coastal village of Crythin Gifford to sort through the papers of a deceased woman, to determine if she had passed on any debts, or made any will. Kipps arrives and discovers that nobody there wants to speak or have anything to do with the death of this woman, who only referred to as “the woman in black”, or to the events that took place there some time ago. Kipps’ only client is Mrs. Drablow (played perfectly by the amazing Ciarán Hinds), who informs him that her husband, the owner of Eel Marsh House, died in 1912, leaving her and her son Joseph alone. Joseph passed on 2 years ago, and as his friend asked, Mrs. Drablow requests that Kipps see to the funeral arrangements.\n\nKipps finds himself alone in an old, cold, deserted house with Mrs. Drablow’s maid, the only person he can find to talk to. After a strange encounter on the grounds, which he blames on his grief, he soon realizes that the ghost of a woman – who has not been seen alive for some time – is haunting the house and anyone that passes by has to be able to see her in order for her to appear, which is why her face has grown obscured by fear.\n\nAs the tension mounts and Kipps’ investigation deepens, the hauntings become more and more sinister. Although there isn’t a great deal of time dedicated to build the scene, or to introduce Kipps, after a slow start it doesn’t take long at all to feel an attachment to the character. The film is also very entertaining, and Radcliffe does a great job in bringing emotion, humor and charisma to the role, which is different from anything he has done before, in an effort to shake off being “potter” once and for all.\n\nThere are some scenes that are brilliant, especially when",

It's about Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren), who fled Vienna with her family to escape Nazi persecution. She left behind many possessions including some valuable paintings done by Gustav Klimt. After the war ended she returned to find out what had happened to those items only to discover they were confiscated by the Nazis and given to the Austrian government as part of their spoils of war. When she tried to get them back, she found herself up against the Austrian government which refused to return any of the artworks it claimed belonged to its people. This led to a long legal battle between Ms. Altman and the Austrians over ownership rights. In 2006, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Mrs. Altmann allowing her to keep all of her property including several famous works by Klimt such as Portrait Of Adele Bloch-Bauer I & II along with others worth millions today!",
    "> One thing that bothered me about this film was it implied a false reality to certain elements and how much they can or can't be manipulated by various means, which is always a sore subject with me because movies sometimes over-hype things in science fiction/fantasy settings. But aside from my nitpicking here and there over some minor discrepancies, it was still an overall enjoyable piece; it had plenty enough action scenes to keep me satisfied (though not exactly as impressive as what they pulled off in Inception) even if most of those were fairly derivative but nonetheless fun--especially the scene involving Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro where the former gets hit repeatedly on his temple by a car door; also liked the sequence near the end when Ed's eyes are wide open while he stumbles through the streets completely exhausted yet utterly awake (kinda like Neo from The Matrix when he first found out how powerful he really could become). As a final note--while I certainly don't endorse drugs myself, Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job giving off that impression of one who clearly abuses them frequently until he eventually learns moderation and becomes responsible once more.",
    "> This film is the very reason I started studying cinematography. You have to watch this film, especially if you are interested in filmmaking. It shows how to tell an entire story without ever resorting to fancy CGI or showy camera techniques; it shows how to write a script (or at least how to write a script for this film), build characters, and the importance of an original score. And it was only ten million dollars!!! A lot of low budget films today would be lucky to make the same sort of impact that “12 Angry Men” had, and that film was made before there was even such a thing as a digital camera. In the end, this is a good movie with a good message that transcends its age and medium to show us that not how how powerful technology can be, but how powerful humanity and intelligence are.\n\nThat is what a good movie review does that gets your attention right away without necessarily providing a great deal of information or even saying much about the production details. The reviewer talks in the language of the movie, talks in a way that makes one interested whether or not one has seen the movie.\n\nNow contrast with the following review:\n\n> A lot of people have heard of this film, because itâ€™s so well known to be a really good film. However, I was a little disappointed with it. For those of you who donâ€™t know anything about the plot, itâ€™s about 12 men who are summoned for jury duty (or whatever itâ€™s called). They have to decide whether to convict a man of killing his father or not. There is only one other character, the murder suspect. Basically, they talk it out and the film goes though one argument after another about whether the suspect was telling the truth or not, about what the manâ€™s intentions were, and all sorts of other things. I think itâ€™s just not my type of film. I guess if you liked it, good for you. I really am the exact opposite. I like action, excitement. Thatâ€™s not to say that I dislike thought provoking films, I really love that, but they just really have to be thought provoking. Maybe you just might get something out of it, but for",
    "Mummified horror has become the newest addition to Hollywood's long list of overused and completely destroyed franchises, with this reboot being one that may have been better off ignored entirely by most audiences. Brendan Fraser made his name among genre fans through several hits which came out during the late 90's, among them two different titles in regards to this character (the first the original mummy trilogy, which was produced just under a decade before the release of this film). While it wasn’t exactly well-made cinema at any point, there are some notable elements to be appreciated throughout those flicks. Most importantly here though would be its clear sense of adventure within both scenarios as they were presented...\nSource: Famous Monsters",
    "Forget about your PC-driven reality shows, TV’s got itself the most bizarre yet charming lineup in modern history with this brilliantly anachronistic tale set aboard a floating radio pirate station circa 1966—and its not all as whacky and jolly as some might think. This fun ride through a glorious era has loads of nostalgic good times to offer but it’s also one of those rare moments in filmmaking when things seem so right in today's world in spite of obvious historical references.\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman plays “The Count,” a smooth-talking but stern leader of his pirates at sea; he runs the operation on board the ship known only as ‘the boat’ which broadcasts around the clock with unlicensed rock music outlawed by tainted government propaganda. The film offers more than just a clever name for its audience since it sets sail quite immediately with catch songs such as ‘You Really Got Me’, which gets everyone off their feet and cheering for hours on end. Of course theres still room for drama here because afterall nobody stays long in any paradise without fighting or risk of being caught now wasnt that always the case?\n\nPhillips makes great use outta character dynamics between DJ Sam (Jack Davenport) & reporter Gail(Lauren Lambie); she’s an American expat looking to find herself whereas him already knows too much detailing life at sea including its perils so it may take time until they become friends again but we can be sure that there will come around later into events! Other personalities emerge throughout film including Tom Wisdom playing Quentin (who thinks very highly despite lacking skills), Nicholas Hoult does well showing nervousness during early scenes before finding confidence thanks mostly due thanks mainly through Bill Nighys contributions – hes seen wearing glasses throughout while acting opposite other characters hence why he stands out among them all.. If theres anyone who deserves credit here then Philip would take responsibility if anything goes awry within crew member ranks then hes done enough damage control himself anyway…\n\nThis wild ride takes place against what feels likes idyllic waters filled with clear sky blue colors giving us beautiful imagines whenever ships approach coastlines – perfect moment indeed where both parties get excited sharing moments together even though they aren`t",

    "I'm not sure what to make of this film, but it was certainly an interesting experience. It has been said that Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) and Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon), the captain of South Africa's rugby team, were instrumental in bringing about reconciliation between blacks and whites after apartheid ended in 1994. This film tells their story.\n\nThe first thing you notice when watching this film is how beautiful it looks. Director Clint Eastwood uses sweeping shots of the African landscape as well as close-ups on faces to tell his story. He also makes good use of music by Hans Zimmer to set the mood.\n\nBut there are problems with this film too. For one thing, it seems like we never really get inside either character's head enough to understand why they do what they do or feel what they feel. We see them talking about things like racism and forgiveness, but we don't actually hear any dialogue about these issues until near the end of the film. And even then, it feels more like exposition than anything else.\n\nAnother problem is that some scenes seem out of place or unnecessary. There's a scene where Mandela goes into prison wearing only underwear because he wants to show solidarity with other prisoners who have no clothes at all; however, later on in another scene he appears fully clothed again without explanation. Also, there's a scene where Pienaar visits his mother in hospital just before she dies; however, nothing comes of this visit except for him crying over her body afterwards which doesn't seem very important considering everything else going on around him at the time.\n\nOverall though, Invictus does manage to convey its message effectively despite its flaws. If you want something uplifting yet thought provoking then give this film a try!",
    "I'm not sure what to make of this film, but it was certainly entertaining and visually stunning. It has been compared to \"The Sixth Sense,\" which is an apt comparison in that both films are about ghosts who have unfinished business on earth. However, unlike \"The Sixth Sense,\" there is no mystery as to whether or not Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) can see dead people; he does so quite literally. In fact, his ability to see them is one of the reasons why he is sent to Sleepy Hollow by the town council to investigate a series of murders committed with a headless horseman's axe.\n\nDepp plays Ichabod Crane as a man out of time, a rationalist in a world where superstition reigns supreme. He is also something of a coward, though he tries hard to hide it behind his intellectual facade. His relationship with Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), daughter of the local magistrate, is complicated by her attraction to Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien), a handsome young soldier who seems more interested in fighting than studying law books like Ichabod does.\n\nThere are many things I liked about this movie, including its beautiful cinematography and production design. But I found myself wishing that director Tim Burton had taken some risks instead of playing it safe. For example, while I enjoyed seeing Johnny Depp play such an unusual character, I would have preferred if he hadn't looked exactly like Jack Skellington from \"Nightmare Before Christmas.\" Also, although Christina Ricci gave a good performance here, she didn't seem very convincing as someone who could fall in love with either Brom or Ichabod. Finally, despite being set during colonial times, none of the characters spoke with any kind of accent except for Ichabod himself. This made me wonder how they managed to communicate without speaking English at all!\n\nOverall, however, I did enjoy watching this movie because it reminded me of other classic horror stories like Dracula and Frankenstein. If you're looking for something different from your typical Halloween fare then give this one a try. Just don't expect too much from it.",
    "I'm not sure what to make of this film, but it was certainly entertaining and funny in parts. Jack Nicholson plays Melvin Udall, an obsessive-compulsive writer who has no social skills at all. He lives alone with his dog Verdell (who he treats like a human being) and spends most of his time writing or going out to eat. His favorite restaurant is owned by Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), who waits on him every day. She also takes care of her mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. One night when she comes home late after work, she finds that someone has broken into her apartment and stolen some things. When she goes back to work the next morning, she discovers that one of her customers, Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), has been beaten up badly outside the restaurant. After taking him to the hospital, they become friends and start dating each other. Meanwhile, Melvin meets a gay artist named Sy (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who helps him get over his fear of dogs so that he can adopt one from the pound. This leads to a friendship between them which eventually turns romantic. As you might expect, there are plenty of complications along the way before everything works itself out happily ever after.\n\nThe acting here is excellent across the board. Jack Nicholson gives another great performance as usual; he really knows how to play these kinds of roles well. Helen Hunt does very well too; although she doesn't have much screen time compared to everyone else, she still manages to stand out among the rest. Greg Kinnear is good as always; however, Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character seems rather unnecessary since we already know about Melvin's relationship with Sy anyway. Still, he adds something special to the storyline because without him, nothing would happen between Melvin and Carol. Overall, this is a fun comedy drama that will keep you entertained throughout its entire runtime. If you enjoy watching movies where people learn valuable lessons while having fun doing so then give this one a try!",

Every line, expression, movement, music, picture... everything was meticulously placed in position without any single unnecessary detail - just perfect story-telling to drive home the point...'

    "I've been waiting to see this film since it was first announced, and now that I have seen it, I can say without reservation that it is one of the best films ever made. It has everything you could want in an action/sci-fi flick - great special effects, good acting (especially by Keanu Reeves), and a storyline that will keep your mind working long after the credits roll.\n\nThis is not just another sci-fi flick with lots of explosions and car chases; there are some very deep philosophical questions raised here about what reality really means. Is our world real? Or is it all just a dream? And if so, who created us? What does it mean to be human? These are the kinds of things that make me think that this film may become a classic like Blade Runner or 2001.\n\nIf you haven't already seen it, go out and rent it today! You won't regret it!",

    "I don’t often get nostalgic about films. There have been many I’ve enjoyed over the years but I rarely get nostalgic about them. I can say the same about this film – Glory Road. A powerful story of racial equality, friendship and teamwork. But what makes this film stand out – a fact that I do tend to get very nostalgic about – is the fact that this film was not only made with black people cast in the lead roles, but it was made for black people.\n\nThe story isn’t just about the trials and tribulations of the African Americans, but it is also a tale of their triumph, their strength and their character and it is a story that, while fictionalized, is still inspirational and is still relevant in today’s society with people of colour constantly fighting for equality regardless of where you look – be it in athletics (the sports world), entertainment, politics and in academia. This movie still manages to hit close to home and is still as powerful today as when I saw it in 2006 (albeit it not as powerful because of the political and social landscape back then), which is a testament to the cast and to the story itself.\n\nFor me and my family, this story is important because I am a big sports fan and I am not just talking about the “white” American kind but also the kind that the whole world enjoys such as Cricket, Rugby, Football (Soccer), Baseball (which I know is from America), Golf etc, where a multi-racial or multi-cultural team, in this case an American one, does not discriminate on those they play with, but on the individual player’s skill and talent regardless of the colour of their skin.\n\nIn sports, the team comes first. They do not discriminate the way that it is portrayed in the film “Glory Road” and this is why this film is so important because it is a movie we can all learn from and understand, and this is why I get nostalgic about this particular story – because the story of the integration of the Texas Western Miners Basketball Team – is a story in which anyone can learn from.

    "The only way to fully grasp how the U.S is currently conducting operations throughout their nation and abroad using our tax dollars, you need to watch this film in it entirety. A lot was happening during Snowdens tenure with the CIA and NSA that were clearly not in accordance with 4th Amendment rights as far back as December of 2005 and well after his resignation. One example; If they suspect someone will do something dangerous within a given timeframe they can surveille them without any warrantees. But once they have the data/evidence of said offense(s), the case must be brought before the FISA court which reviews matters within these very narrow guidelines. When one goes out on their own and begins snooping like Clintons private server, or the FBI wiretapping Trump Towers (allegedly) then we are all in trouble. No person has the right and certainly no government entity should be able to violate the privacy of citizens with such unbridled impunity.\n\nI was quite interested in seeing how Jeremy Renner portrayed S.O.A.M, but it seemed unnecessary to me because S.O's real life counterpart in some ways didn't come across nearly as likable or empathetic. He is depicted rather coldly while Renee Russo plays more along the lines of an enabler who at times seems dispassionate to everything he does - even when she tries to show her husband what S.O. accomplishes in a meeting, by showing him files of children murdered. There are moments where Mizrusso comes off too dryly, and even though it may be intentionality due to long years together maybe the wife did grow a little jaded? It would also explain why S.O. has grown desensitized overtime having witnessed so much horror first hand but still has not been scarred? What's amazing about such great screenwritng is if you look below there are several facts hidden deep within dialogue exchanged between those two characters who happen sit facing away/side-by- side each other on multiple occasions.

As a story about four losers in LA, it can almost be dismissed as another \"Reservoir Dogs\", just this time with a bigger budget. But the plot is more complicated and has no \"really\" ending. It is about how these losers think and feel, and how they deal with their lives. And some of them get killed.\n\nThe most interesting character in the movie is Captain Koons, a Vietnam Veteran who is still tormented by the memory of the child he had to leave behind in Southeast Asia, so he gives his watch to the father of that child, when he returns to the USA.\n\nThe action is not realistic, but the film explores in details the character of the people we encounter, and most of them are good and decent people, who just do their best.\n\nThe use of the soundtrack is absolutely brilliant and contributes to a major part of the story by commenting the movie (as in the scene at the diner or in the opening scene).\n\nMy favorite passage in the movie follows:\n\nButch: Look what you almost did to her! You almost blew her fucking head off!\nVincenz: Yeah? What have you done, hmm? What have you done?\nButch: Look, I got a whole lot of respect here for you, and that was really cool what you did with that guy with the hand!

From the opening scenes, it's clear that this isn't just about the game - it's also about the people who play it, their families, friends, and the communities they come from.\n\nThe film follows several characters as they navigate their way through the ups and downs of their careers, both on and off the field. There are moments of triumph and joy, but there are also times when things get dark and dangerous. It's a raw, unflinching look at what it takes to make it in the world of football, and how those pressures can sometimes push people to do things they never thought possible.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of The Football Factory is its incredible attention to detail. Every aspect of the film feels authentic, from the way the players move and talk to the way the crowds behave during matches. You really feel like you're right there with them, experiencing everything firsthand.\n\nAnother strength of the film is its cast. Each actor brings something unique to their character, making them all fully-realized, three-dimensional individuals.

    "This film has been nominated in 10 categories at this year's Academy Awards, and it deserves every one! It was an amazing experience to watch such great acting by all involved (especially Jack Nicholson). The story line kept me guessing until almost halfway through when everything started coming together nicely; then there were some twists that really surprised even though they made sense after thinking about them later on during my drive home afterwards...I highly recommend seeing THE DEPARTED if you haven't already done so because not only does Martin Scorsese do his usual excellent job directing but also Leonardo DiCaprio proves once again why he should be considered among Hollywood elite actors today - especially since most people still think back fondly upon Titanic as being their favorite role played thus far throughout Leo D.'s career up till now.\"",

After much deliberation ordered new copy without qualms since most reviews confirm there have only been two releases both offering similar image quality; furthermore film itself enjoys classic status amongst critics if not quite as popularly regarded perhaps more recently owing no doubt largely due purely its length...I say long may such classics remain available because they're usually worth every bit their while!

    "I just returned home from a long, yet enjoyable day at the movies. I first saw the \"Quantum of Solace\" movie at 3:40 this afternoon at the Mall of America here in Bloomington, Minnesota. I then returned to the theater an hour and 45 minutes later to see the movie again. My second viewing of the movie was at 5:40 p.m. It should be noted that I don't often see a movie that I like a second time, but the \"Quantum of Solace\" movie is simply exceptional. I have always been a big James Bond fan, and I also enjoy seeing a movie that is in keeping with the storyline that exists in an author's books. Such was the case with Ian Fleming's book \"Quantum of Solace,\" which also served as the basis for the \"Quantum of Solace\" movie.\nIan Fleming is my all-time favorite author, and this movie is very much in keeping with my image of James Bond. I am also very much in agreement with the casting choices made for the movie, especially Daniel Craig as James Bond. Daniel Craig has portrayed James Bond very well. I have a good deal of respect for the producers of the movie for having the good taste to include one of my favorite scenes from the book in the movie. (That scene was included in the earlier portion of the movie in the scene in which James Bond is in a gambling establishment.) I also liked the decision made to show James Bond as the hard-edged, no nonsense, tough-as-nails spy that Ian Fleming intended James Bond to be. Daniel Craig has successfully shown the tough-guy James Bond that Ian Fleming created in the book \"Quantum of Solace.\"\nWhile I really liked the \"Quantum of Solace\" movie, I did have one problem with it. That was my inability to understand the character, Camille, as being Italian. I believe that Camille was to be portrayed as an American in the movie rather than an Italian. I believe that I may know the actress, Olga Kurylenko, who played Camille in this movie. I met her in February of this year at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Film Festival. I was particularly impressed with Ms. Kurylenko when I met her because she was obviously fluent in not only her native Russian language but also in English. I don't know how much of",
    "\"This romantic comedy features two very talented young people who were destined to meet. Both Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) and Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) work for the same newspaper where Ben is trying to make a career out of being a writer and Alison aspires to find a way to get a good story to move up to being a reporter. Their chance meeting on her birthday which Ben attends under orders by his editor is a turning point and not something either one expected from being sent on an assignment by their respective editors to review the same event. They find themselves together and she is still at the party and he is on a different assignment, which is supposed to be all day. He is told to write about what is happening all day long. She is getting ready to leave the party because she sees him there and knows it is over between them because there would be a conflict in of interest and professionalism by her having a relationship with him. She tries to avoid the conflict by going home and Ben insists on going with her which gets a little out of hand because it is her birthday and she has promised not to drive. He gives her his car keys and his driver's license and she takes a taxi home since he is still there and has things yet to do about the article. When he does not hear from her, he thinks it is the end because she does not want or need him any more and goes over to her place to tell her about his feelings. The taxi driver who took her home dropped her off at home, got paid and that was it. Ben is still there waiting and is invited in to stay and see her. He does not drive and was stuck there and he thought he would be staying with her friend who just happened to leave her car keys behind, which Ben picked up and went into Alison's home. He spends the night on the couch because she is asleep with the remote control in her hand, so he thinks he is all right and can stay for the night until she awakens and he tries to walk her to her room. Alison awakes thinking about him that she should have never done what she did with him. It feels to her like it is all over for her the next morning with the guilt she is feeling about going to the party with him and him ending up staying the night. He had left his car there and Alison",
    "This film was so good that it made me cry, and not just because Thanos killed half my favorite characters in one fell swoop (though he did). The story line had been building up to this moment since Iron Man 1 came out 10 years ago! It's amazing how well they've kept everything consistent throughout all these movies while still making each installment feel fresh with new ideas added into them as needed without ever feeling like too much has changed or anything feels forced upon us by some outside force trying desperately hard enough make sure we don't forget about what happened before even though there are now more than 20 films worth watching between then & today alone; but yet somehow manages never once lose sight on where its going next either - which makes sense considering Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige himself said back when Guardians Vol 2 premiered last year during Comic Con 2017 panel Q&A session at San Diego Convention Center Hall H-1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8I9J10K11L12M13N14O15P16Q17R18S19T20U21V22W23X24Y25Z26AA27AB28AC29AD30AE31AF32AG33AH34AI35AJ36AK37AL38AM39AN40AO41AP42AQ43AR44AS45AT46AU47AV48AW49AX50AY51AZ52BA53BB54BD55BE56BF57BG58BH59BI60BL61BM62BN63BO64BP65BR66BS67BT68BU69BV70BW71BY72CA73CC74CD75CE76CF77CG78CH79CI80CL81CM82CN83CO84CP85CS86CT87CU88CV89CW90CX91CY92DA93DB94DD95DE96DF97DG98DH99DI100DJ101DK102DL103DM104DN105DO106DP107DQ108DR109DS110DT111DU112DV113DW114DX115DY116EA117EB118EC119ED120EE121EF122EG123EH124EL125EM126EN127EP128EQ129ER130ES131ET132EU133EV134EW135EX136FA137FB138FC139FE140FF141FG142FH143FI144FL145FM146FN147FO148FP149FR150FS151",
    "This film was made in 1997, and it's about four girls who are called Spices (Melanie Brown aka Scary), Mel C., Emma Bunton & Geri Halliwel) They're all very pretty but they can't sing or dance at first so their manager puts them through training to become pop stars! The story line isn’t that great because there really aren‘ t any plot twists except when one spice gets pregnant by her boyfriend which causes some drama between friends until she has an abortion then everything goes back normal again…but overall this flick rocks!!

    "This film, based on true events during The Civil War (1861-65), tells about an all black regiment that was formed in Massachusetts and sent to fight against slavery by fighting with Union forces at Fort Wagner near Charleston South Carolina where they were ordered into battle without proper training or weapons but still managed victory despite overwhelming odds because their commander Colonel Shaw refused surrender even though he knew it meant certain death which made him one hero among many others who fought bravely throughout this war including those men whose names we don't know today yet deserve recognition just like any other soldier would've gotten back then when there weren’t enough white soldiers left alive after four years worth killing eachother over something as simple land ownership rights between states rather than anything else such politics could have been avoided if only people had listened more closely instead focusing solely upon themselves while ignoring what mattered most; freedom!

    "This film was not as good, but it wasn't bad either! It's just that this one didn't have Johnny Depp in his role and he made Jack Sparrow so much fun to watch on screen with all those funny lines & facial expressions!! The new Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) did an excellent job though; however there were some scenes where you could tell they had used CGI instead because Geoffrey looked like himself when playing other characters such us Blackbeard or Davy Jones before him which would've been better if done live action rather than computer generated images since these are supposed be real people afterall right? But overall still enjoyed watching even without seeing any familiar faces again except maybe Orlando Bloom who plays Will Turner once more here too 🙂",
    "This film was not what i expected, but it certainly wasn't bad either! It's an interesting take on Pocahontas and John Smiths relationship in that they are portrayed as being very much like two teenagers who fall head over heels with each other at first sight (which isn' t how most people think about them). The acting by Colin Farrell & Qothian Manchett-Smith were both excellent; however there seemed to be some problems between these actors which resulted into their characters having little chemistry together - something you would expect considering all those years apart before meeting again after returning home safely back across seas once more.\"",

    "This film was an instant classic when it came out in 1999, and has since become one that will be remembered as long there are people who love movies around to talk about them! The Wachowski Brothers (Lana & Andy) have created something truly unique with this story; they've taken elements found throughout many different genres such sci-fi/action films like Star Wars or Terminator 2 but also added their own twist by making Neo's journey into another world seem more realistic than most other similar stories would allow him too - which makes sense considering how much time he spends inside his computer programing code lines instead just fighting off bad guys all day every single second without any breaks whatsoever until finally reaching some sorta climax where everything seems resolved once again only temporarily though because now comes part two...which brings us back right here at square zero ready start over yet? It doesn't matter if you're newbie watching these things fresh today after seeing nothing else before hand except maybe trailers online somewhere--you'll still find yourself completely immersed within minutes thanks largely due its amazing visual effects coupled together perfectly alongside equally impressive performances given both actors playing lead roles Keanu Reeves(Neo), Laurence Fishburne.(Morpheus).",
    "Movie: Eyes Wide Shut (1999)\nThe story is about a married couple (Dr. Bill Harford and Alice Harford, played by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman respectively). It chronicles their journey of discovery and struggle, culminating in Bill's exploration of his sexual psyche during their dinner and sex party. The movie also explores the relationship between husband and wife, their fears, hopes and aspirations, and the ultimate journey of self.\nThere are two predominant themes in Eyes Wide Shut. The first is the relationship between Harford and his wife. The movie explores his insecurities as a husband and how he tries to deal with them. The second dominant theme is fantasy and reality, and how the film deals with them in the process of exploring sexual psyche of the protagonist, Bill.\nFor me, the first theme of the movie, exploration of the relationship between husband and wife, is the weak part of the movie. While the story has potential for development, it is not fully explored. We learn little about the characters and their story. The relationship between husband and wife is left ambiguous, which makes the movie much less interesting.\nThe story follows the story of Bill, a married man, as he falls in love with a woman named Victoria who is a widow and a mother. When she leaves her husband, he has to come to terms with the fact that he will never have the kind of relationship he wants with her. He starts to have fantasies about the three women and is unsure what he should do.\nWhen Bill meets the three women, he starts to have feelings for them. He begins to act in a childish manner and does not know what to do with the situation. The three women try to help him out, but he starts to lose his grip on reality. They tell him to stop being childish, that his behavior is not what he should be doing.\nThis movie is a psychological drama that deals with the issues of love, sex, and self-discovery. It is a psychological film, which means that it deals with emotion and not just physical pleasure. The movie also has some very interesting themes and ideas. Those are:\nThe movie is a psychological drama, but it also has a lot of sex scenes. The sex scenes are used in the movie to explore the characters and their relationships. Some of the scenes have lots of sex, and some of them",

    "\"Ghost was like a little kid with a new tricycle when it came out back in 1990. It seemed to have it all: A big budget; an A-list cast; a director who was on his way out of the closet; flashy special effects; and an alluring soundtrack. And while it may not age quite as well as other movies of its time, it is still quite entertaining.\nIn a nutshell, it tells the story of a Manhattan banker who, shortly before his wedding, is killed by a mugger in an abandoned subway tunnel, but in the process he manages to manifest himself onto the person of his best friend, who suddenly develops psychic powers.\nThe film has some interesting ideas, but is a bit overbearing with its message: \"The good die young and the bad live forever.\"\nSome of the characters are somewhat shallow, and the performances are somewhat one note, but the movie benefits from a strong supporting cast--particularly Whoopi Goldberg (as the medium) and Bill Nunn (as a police detective). The story is somewhat predictable, but there are still some surprises along the way, and there is a satisfying emotional payoff at the end. It also has one of the most effective jump scenes I have ever seen in a movie, and one of the most disturbing murder scenes as well.\nI am often amazed at the things that have managed to become cult classics in recent years. How did \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" and \"Tank Girl,\" two of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune of seeing, become cult classics?\n\"Ghost\" is not a great movie, but it is entertaining, and you might as well have a little fun with it before reality slaps you in the face. (by sascha seattle )\"\nThe movie, \"Ghost\", is about a ghost who, although living as a ghost, is also very alive. The movie shows life from a ghostly perspective and it is not only a very spiritual movie, it actually is also very sexual.\nThe movie opens with a love affair between Sam and Molly. Sam is very much in love with Molly and, though he doesn't show it, he is jealous and he is suspicious.\nMolly has an affair with a married man, Frank, and she wants a divorce. The affair goes on for some time and in",

This was much better than any other Best Picture nominees this year with many more funny lines per minute as well while saying something new about current events in Hollywood rather then just being an interesting plot device like Avatar where you're still talking or watching two people have sex at least once every 30 minutes during most scenes even though only 20-30 percent are set off planet compared against The Tourist which might be funnier if Angelina wasn’t giving out such fake laughs/being phony by never showing her real personality unless we want our opinion changed now that she finally got into some kind action without really doing anything herself except using bad makeup?

    "I'm not sure what to make about this film, but it's definitely one that will be remembered in years and decades ahead as an example on how far Hollywood has gone with its remakes/reboots (and sequels). It was funny at times; however there were also moments where you could see through all those jokes because they weren't really original or clever enough - especially when compared against other films like The Hangover trilogy which have been around since 2009! But if anything else can save 21 JUMP STREET then maybe we should just give up hope altogether...because nothing seems capable anymore.\"",

    "A moving story about an American young boy's desperate attempt to contact his ill-disposed father in World War II Japan, this little known and underappreciated film touches on some very sensitive issues which remain controversial even today; namely racism among Upscale citizens against Asian immigrant immigrants who have come into America seeking better lives than they would ever enjoy back home along with Americans' posturing that their countrymen were never at fault either morally nor militarily during WWII (especially when regarding what happened between Pearl Harbor where there was no official declaration beforehand although it remains unknown whether or not such military attack could've been avoided altogether). As far as its ending goes however many may think otherwise but since most people tend only focus upon individual actions rather analyzing them all collectively together those things don't really amount too much anymore do you agree? Either way though how can one explain why so few movies based around these events truly touch us deeply enough especially considering we know exactly...",
    "Somewhere in the world, there's a kid who didn't get the memo. A kid who's never really heard \"Come Together\" or \"Octopus' Garden.\" Maybe it's at a country and western hoedown, or a disco-dancing contest (where he's got that \"I'm A Loser\" beat so perfect) or an Elvis impersonator contest. Or maybe he's a little beatnik who's in a jazz club--but he's the only kid in the place. No matter where he's playing, he's so good and so young that by far, he's the coolest thing in the club. He's the one with the best chops. He's the best of the best. He's playing the best. The best. He's rockin' the most. He's playin' the hottest. The hottest. His drumming is kickin'. He's a drummer's drummer and he can play all night, all night. And, he still needs a good pair of shoes.\nWe're introduced to him as a baby, in a cradle, looking all angelic as he floats in a black void. It's the most peaceful introduction to a baby since it was discovered that babies are, indeed, angels (in the sense that their wings are spread, but they're not flapping--just floating through the air).\n\"When I was younger, I used to think I was a freak,\n\"I was the type they called a dreamer,\nI was the type they called a freak\"\nThis kid thinks of himself as a freak. In truth he's a dreamer, but that's not how he sees it. So he's stuck in this limbo with all these thoughts of what he is, but no thought of what he can be.

He's dreaming, and he's seeing a new world, where he's all cool and everybody knows his name. Except, he doesn't have shoes and he doesn't really get all that. Until he meets her.

    "This film was based on true events that happened to one family in Thailand during Christmas 2004, when an earthquake and tsunami hit Southeast Asia causing massive destruction along coastal areas including Sri Lanka (where this story takes place). The main character Maria Bennett played by Naomi Watts has three children who are all with her at their vacation home near Khao Lak Beach where they were staying while visiting relatives there; however due mostly likely because she had been drinking heavily throughout most days leading up until then without any food intake whatsoever which caused dehydration among other things resulting not only physical weakness but also mental instability as well since alcohol consumption can cause hallucinations too!

    "\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\" is based on a book by Jon Ronson, which I've never read, nor do I intend to. I was drawn to go see it because it is supposedly based on real events and I wanted to see if they would \"change\" any details of the story in order to make the movie more palatable to the public. If you have never heard of it, it is a great idea, or at least a good idea, but it is NOT as good as it sounds. The movie, which was adapted by the screenwriter behind \"The Big Lebowski\" and \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" and directed by actor-turned-director Grant Heslov (who is best know for his role as Agent Tom Reese in \"The Hunt for Red October\" and in 2004, he was the Democratic Party's delegate in charge of organizing and planning the Democratic National Convention in Boston) and scripted by the screenwriter behind \"A Serious Man,\" Peter Straughan and \"Dusk,\" Andrew Niccol, I'll tell you right now: despite the big names involved, the movie is a disappointment and a let down. And while it is interesting to some degree, it never manages to rise beyond the novelty and the \"outrageous.\"\nThe story itself centers on a reporter, who, in an attempt to write new and different articles, ventures into the world of special forces to see if they have any interesting secret projects. He finds that they do: the military has been involved with an occult group called the \"The New World Order\" which has been trying to develop psychic and paranormal abilities in some of the military's special forces personnel. That is the point where the movie is at its most original. Unfortunately, after that, it gets bogged down in long boring talking-head scenes in front of a committee asking questions about whether or not these \"Special Forces\" actually exist or are actually worth the cost of development. There is nothing particularly funny (or interesting) about this movie. You are not laughing. You are not gasping for breath in excitement. All you are doing was watching a boring-looking movie, which, at its most exciting is just going to annoy you because it is making fun of religion (the fact that the government has invested much money and time into finding God, but that those",
    "\"Let me start off by saying I know it's popular opinion that SM3 was the movie that finally put Spidey to rest for the time being. While I can see that this could conceivably be the case, I found the movie to be extremely enjoyable (a sentiment I shared with several people in the theater). The movie was entertaining and well acted (I was thoroughly impressed with Topher Grace) and did well to wrap up the Tobey Maguire storyline.\nOne of the major criticisms made against the film was that it focused too heavily on the villains instead of Spider-Man. While I can see that point, it was certainly evident that this was a transition film and some of the storyline did move very quickly. There were several sequences that were completely enjoyable, and of course, that's the essence of any film: you want to entertain the audience, and this one certainly accomplished that goal.\nThe thing I feel that got lost in the shuffle was all of the amazing special effects. In a movie where the hero is swinging about on webs, you'd think that people would comment on how amazing it was to see it on the big screen. I was thrilled to see all of the amazing CGI that accompanied the swinging scenes; whether it involved Spider-Man swinging about the buildings in New York or a giant robot coming alive in the middle of the city, the effects were awe-inspiring. And it was amazing to see how well the stuntmen performed on the sets which required a little extra pizazz.\nUltimately, SM3 is just another step in the evolving storyline, and just like so many other franchises which have followed a similar route, this movie was meant to serve a purpose: setting up the franchise for the new actors who will star in the next iteration of Spidey. And it accomplished just that. While there were no big surprises or epic fights with the Sandman, the movie was worth my time and I'm sure many others enjoyed it as well. What's next for Spidey? The next generation will determine the continuation of this beloved franchise.\"\nFrom the standpoint of marketing, one of the reasons the above review is impressive is that it is both credible and comprehensive. In other words, it contains a wide range of interesting information. Additionally, it isn't just another review that simply restates what a lot of other reviewers have",

    "\"An American woman travels to Ireland to attend her best friend's funeral. Once there, she makes a shocking discovery about her dearly departed.\"\n\"This movie is set in Los Angeles but was shot mostly in Ireland. The first scene is of Gerry (Gerard Butler) at his wife's funeral. He doesn't like to read the eulogy so he reads from a CD that Holly wrote for him. (The real reason is revealed later) Holly (Hilary Swank) was a woman who loved to live life and spread happiness around her. After the funeral, Holly's friends find Holly's notebook, which she wrote to Gerry to open after her death, along with the enclosed CD of how to be in a relationship and some other little things. She mentions that Gerry will love her forever and always. One of her best friends is Holly's boss, Aisling (Lisa Kudrow) who makes a lot of noise at the funeral and tries to hold Gerry accountable for her friends early death by giving cancer a really bad name. Holly had planned to move to Ireland. The movie is mainly about the grief these people go through as she never had an illness or didn't smoke or drink or take drugs or anything. She wasn't overweight and she didn't hang out with smokers who would give her second hand smoke. You have never seen Hilary Swank so fat. In the movie you see him at his fattest around the house in his pajamas and his hair is falling out from chemo. All the girls in her book club (in L.A.) dress in all white, as was Holly's fashion, when they read excerpts from Holly's notebook. Then you have some Irish gangster who tries to kill Butler after Gerry accidentally pushes him off a bar stool on another attempt to get rid of the gangster he has been tailing. In the end they all end up in Ireland. He goes to Ireland and falls in love with her all over again and goes back thinking she was an angel. This movie had so much potential. Hilary Swank is such a great actress and a great body was a waste. It reminded me of \"Bridget Jones's Diary\". The dialogue is a little cheesy at times and she had the weirdest friends. In the book club scene when they read, \"If",

Visually stunning and emotionally engaging from start to finish, \"The Terminal\" doesn't disappoint on any level.
