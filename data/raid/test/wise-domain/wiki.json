    "Isabel Frances Grant MBE (1887–1983) was a Scottish ethnographer, historian, collector and pioneering founder of the Highland Folk Museum. Early life and development\nKnown familiarly from childhood as 'Elsie', Grant was born in Edinburgh on 21 July 1887, but grew up with a strong sense of belonging to the Scottish Highlands and especially the area around Badenoch and Strathspey, with its ancient links to the Clan Grant. A family member of the Grants of Tullochgorm, and daughter of a colonel in the Seaforth Highlanders, she was sent to London and the care of her grandfather Field Marshal Sir Patrick Grant, Goldstick-in-Waiting to Queen Victoria, and his daughter Miss Frances Gough Grant – known as 'Aunt Fan' – when her parents were posted to India. It was Aunt Fan who accompanied Elsie on early visits to museums and art galleries in London, inspiring a life-long interest in material culture and collecting. Later visits to folk museums in Scandinavia encouraged Elsie to dream of a museum for the Highlands and Islands that would preserve and promote a better appreciation of the rapidly disappearing material cultures and Gaelic traditions of northern and western Scotland.",

Despite the hard work, his family was still very poor. For an entire year, he didn't own a pair of shoes, and for two straight years, he owned only one pair of overalls.",
    "Colonel Jonathan Peckham Miller (1797–1847) was an American abolitionist. He served in Greece and returned to be a politician standing up for the rights of slaves and women. He and Sarah Arms Miller used their house as a station on the Underground Railroad. Life\nMiller was born in Randolph, Vermont in 1797 and he was undertaking military training during the War of 1812. He joined the US army in 1817 and attended college in Burlington. The Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire began in 1821 and Miller answered their calls for assistance by travelling there in 1824. His bravery in guerrilla units earned him the rank of Colonel and he returned to America, but still remained loyal to the cause and he raised thousands of dollars and gathered relief supplies. Miller supervised the transportation of these to Greece on behalf of supporters of the Greek cause in Boston and New York where they were shared amongst the war-torn Greeks. Miller returned to Vermont in 1827.  Miller returned with Lucius Miltiades a four year old Greek refugee.  He adopted and raised him.  Miller married Sarah Arms on June 26, 1828. It was Jonathan who followed his new wife in sheltering slaves escaping via the \"Underground Railroad\". The Millers helped the railroad financially and they would ferry escapees using stagecoaches.\n \nMiller's interests in rights made him become a lawyer in 1831 when he also ran for the Vermont legislature. Meanwhile, he arranged for lectures and gave them himself in favor of abolitionist causes. One of his resolutions in 1833 in the legislature was to require senators to promote anti-slavery. In 1835 the radical American reformer Samuel Joseph May came to speak in Montpelier; it was Miller who stepped forward to intercede with a hostile crowd. Vermont was possibly the most abolitionist of the Northern American states. In 1840 the legislature had declared that fugitive slaves were entitled to a trial by jury. This measure was overturned by the Supreme Court but Vermont responded with its own counter initiatives.",
    "The Antonov An-28 (NATO reporting name Cash) is a twin-engined light turboprop transport aircraft, developed from the Antonov An-14M. It was the winner of a competition against the Beriev Be-30, for use by Aeroflot as a short-range airliner. It first flew in 1969. A total of 191 were built and 16 remain in airline service as at August 2015. After a short pre-production series built by Antonov, it was licence-built in Poland by PZL-Mielec. In 1993, PZL-Mielec developed its own improved variant, the PZL M28 Skytruck. Development\nThe An-28 is similar to the An-14 in many aspects, including its wing structure and twin rudders, but features an expanded fuselage and turboprop engines, in place of the An-14's piston engines. The An-28 first flew as a modified An-14 in 1969. The next preproduction model did not fly until 1975.

    "Transgender literature is a collective term used to designate the literary production that addresses, has been written by or portrays people of diverse gender identity. Representations in literature of people that transition their gender have existed for millennia, with the earliest instance probably being the book Metamorphoses, by the Roman poet Ovid. In the twentieth century its notable the novel Orlando (1928), by Virginia Woolf, considered one of the first transgender novels in English and whose plot follows a bisexual poet that changes gender from male to female and lives for hundreds of years. For decades, publications that covered transgender topics were mainly centered on memoirs, with a lengthy tradition that had its earliest example in Man into Woman (1933), by Lili Elbe, and that has lasted until the present times with autobiographical books like The Secrets of My Life (2017), by Caitlyn Jenner. Other memoirs written by trans people that have amassed critical success are: Gender Outlaw (1994), by Kate Bornstein; Man Enough to be a Woman (1996), by Jayne County; Redefining Realness (2014), by Janet Mock; among others.",
    "Sir James Perrot (1571 – 4 February 1636) was a Welsh writer and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1597 and 1629. He was the illegitimate son of Sir John Perrot, who was himself falsely rumoured to be an illegitimate son of Henry VIII. Perrot is now thought to have been born at Westmead Mansion in the Lordship of Laugharne, Carms.  where he lived  with his mother, Sybil Jones and sister Mary until moving to the ancestral family home at Haroldston near Havefordwest sometime  after 1597 when he finally secured its lease by proxy. The actual date of the move is unknown but was probably before his marriage to Mary Ashfield in 1602. It was enabled by the partial settlement of a protracted legal dispute with his legitimate half-brother's widow over his father's estates which continued until her death in 1619. The battle in court over his patrimony was then carried on by his father's uncle Thomas Perrot of Brook (adjacent to the Westmead) and later by John Laugharne of St Brides, the son of Sir John's daughter Lettice. Perrot spent two years at Jesus College, Oxford from 1586, when he was aged 14, and became a member of Middle Temple in 1590. In 1597, he was elected Member of Parliament for Haverfordwest.",

    "The Talgai Skull is a human fossil found on the Talgai Station, near Allora, Southern Downs Region, Queensland, Australia. It has been dated indirectly, based on the radiocarbon date of a carbonate nodule found in stratigraphic proximity, at 13,500 years old. History\nThe Talgai Skull was discovered in 1886 on Talgai Homestead, as the first fossil evidence of early human occupation in the area. It was found by fencing contractor, William Naish. It had been embedded in the wall of Dalrymple Creek, which had been scoured out by heavy rain. In 1896 the skull was sent to Sydney where it was examined by the trustees of the Australian Museum. The museum was interested in purchasing the fossil but could not agree on an acceptable price. Eventually the skull was returned to its owner.\nIt remained at the homestead until 1914 when Professor Edgeworth David, Professor of Archaeology at Sydney University visited Talgai and presented a theory that the skull was 20,000 years old and provided a \"missing link\" in the evolutionary chain. This sudden change in attitude towards the skull was motivated in part by the recent \"discovery\" of the Piltdown man fossils in England. Although later proven to be hoax, the Piltdown find encouraged others to search for similar evidence of early man. CSIRO and the Queensland Museum conducted archaeological surveys at the site.",
    "Dictogloss is a language teaching technique that is used to teach grammatical structures, in which students form small groups and summarize a target-language text. First, the teacher prepares a text that contains examples of the grammatical form to be studied. The teacher reads the text to the students at normal speed while they take notes. Students then work in small groups to prepare a summary of their work using the correct grammatical structures, and finally each group presents their work to the rest of the class. Dictogloss activities encourage learners to focus on the form of their language while also being based in communication, and are used in task-based language teaching. Dictogloss activities have several advantages. They integrate the four language skills of listening, reading, speaking, and writing. They also give students opportunities to talk about both content and the language itself. Furthermore, dictogloss activities are a useful way of presenting new factual information to students and encourage them to listen for key points. Finally, they give support to less confident students, as they are encouraged to participate in their groups as part of the structure of the activity.",
    "Cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia (CLSD, or Boyadjiev–Jabs syndrome) is a neonatal/infancy disease caused by a disorder in the 14th chromosome.  It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that both recessive genes must be inherited from each parent in order for the disease to manifest itself.  The disease causes a significant dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum in fibroblasts of the host with CLSD. Due to the distension of the endoplasmic reticulum, export of proteins (such as collagen) from the cell is disrupted. The production of SEC23A protein is involved in the pathway of exporting collagen (the COPII pathway), but a missense mutation causes and underproduction of SEC23A which inhibits the pathway, affecting collagen secretion. This decrease in collagen secretion can lead to the bone defects that are also characteristic of the disease, such as skeletal dysplasia and under-ossification. Decreased collagen in CLSD-affected individuals contributes to improper bone formation, because collagen is a major protein in the extracellular matrix and contributes to its proper mineralization in bones. It has also been hypothesized that there are other defects in the genetic code besides SEC23A that contribute to the disorder.",

    "Mass amateurization refers to the capabilities that new forms of media have given to non-professionals and the ways in which those non-professionals have applied those capabilities to solve problems (e.g. create and distribute content) that compete with the solutions offered by larger, professional institutions. Mass amateurization is most often associated with Web 2.0 technologies. These technologies include the rise of blogs and citizen journalism, photo and video-sharing services such as Flickr and YouTube, user-generated wikis like Wikipedia, and distributed accommodation services such as Airbnb. While the social web is not the only technology responsible for the rise of mass amateurization, Clay Shirky claims Web 2.0 has allowed amateurs to undertake increasingly complex tasks resulting in accomplishments that would seem daunting within the traditional institutional model. In addition to whole websites and applications, Web 2.0 has also birthed a variety of digital tools that facilitate organization and problem solving on a large scale. These tools include tags, trackbacks, and hashtags. These new forms of media became widely available during the first decade of the 21st century due in part to the fall of transactional costs of creating and distributing media. Mass amateurization is a social, cumulative and collaborative activity, wherein ideas will flow back up the pipeline from consumers and they will share them among themselves.",

    "M.E.Ch.A. (Spanish: Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán; \"Chicano Student Movement of Aztlán\") is a US-based organization that seeks to promote Chicano unity and empowerment through political action. The acronym of the organization's name is the Chicano word mecha, which is the Chicano pronunciation of the English word match and therefore symbolic of a fire or spark; mecha in Spanish means fuse or wick. The motto of MEChA is 'La Union Hace La Fuerza'. Origins in the 1960s\nMEChA began during the 1960s, empowered through the political movements of the time, especially the civil rights and Chicano Movement.

    "Within the field of anthropology and other social sciences, ethnography is a form of research that relies on a range of sources of data, but usually tends to rely mainly on participant observation. However, the term also refers to the product of this type of research, which of course normally takes a textual form. As a result, ethnography is also sometimes seen as a genre of writing, one used to describe patterns of human social interaction in particular contexts. Within the context of ethnography, the term 'realism' is often used to refer to the assumptions that some kinds of ethnographic work make about the phenomena to be investigated, and how these are to be understood. However, 'ethnographic realism' has also been used to refer to a style of writing that narrates the author's experiences and observations as if the reader were witnessing or experiencing events first hand. A work written using ethnographic realism may be referred to as a realist ethnography, and classified as a subgenre of ethnography.",
    "Popcorn Time is a multi-platform, free software BitTorrent client that includes an integrated media player.

    "The Chinese Road (or The Chinese Roads) were a series of highways built as a foreign aid project by the People's Republic of China (PRC) in northern Laos, beginning in 1962. The first new road was built from Mengla, Yunnan Province, PRC to Phongsali, Laos; it was completed on 25 May 1963. The next major road built was Route 46, begun in the 1966 dry season and stretching from the southern tip of Yunnan Province southward toward the border of the Kingdom of Thailand. As 25,000 Chinese troops and 400 antiaircraft guns came to be posted to defend Route 46, and Thai support of American war efforts in both the Laotian Civil War and the Vietnam War became widely known, there was uneasiness among both Thai and American intelligence communities concerning Communist China's intents in constructing the all-weather highway. American interest in the new road extended up to the White House. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) trained guerrillas spied on Route 46, and there was an attempt to block it with the abortive Operation Snake Eyes. However, Chinese antiaircraft fire upon overflying aircraft and steady increases in Chinese troops guaranteed its security from attack. In turn, while there were some preemptive joint military operations during 1972 by troops of both the Royal Lao Army and the Royal Thai Army along the Lao/Thai border just south of Route 46, the road was not used to invade Thailand. The Chinese did chase the local Lao population from the Pak Beng Valley verging on the road to expedite Chinese occupation, but stopped the road at the Mekong River short of the Lao/Thai border. While there were several theories about China's intent in building Route 46, the only firm conclusion was one by an anonymous American military intelligence analyst: \"Northern Laos has a new border.\"",
    "Drug intolerance or drug sensitivity refers to an inability to tolerate the adverse effects of a medication, generally at therapeutic or subtherapeutic doses. Conversely, a patient is said to be \"tolerating\" a drug when they can tolerate its adverse effects.  Some instances of drug intolerance are known to result from genetic variations in drug metabolism. Pathophysiology\nDrugs in systemic circulation have a certain concentration in the blood, which serves as a surrogate marker for how much drug will be delivered throughout the body (how much drug the rest of the body will \"see\"). There exists a minimum concentration of drug within the blood that will give rise to the intended therapeutic effect (minimum effective concentration, MEC), as well as a minimum concentration of drug that will give rise to an unintended adverse drug event (minimum toxic concentration, MTC). The difference between these two values is generally referred to as the therapeutic window. Different drugs have different therapeutic windows, and different people will have different MECs and MTCs for a given drug. If someone has a very low MTC for a drug, they are likely to experience adverse effects at drug concentrations lower than what it would take to produce the same adverse effects in the general populace; thus, the individual will experience significant toxicity at a dose that is otherwise considered \"normal\" for the average person. This individual will be considered \"intolerant\" to that drug.",

    "The 1910 Cuba hurricane, popularly known as the Cyclone of the Five Days, was an unusual and destructive tropical cyclone that struck Cuba and the United States in October 1910. It formed in the southern Caribbean on October 9 and strengthened as it moved northwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 12. After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked in intensity on October 16, corresponding to Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. That same day, the hurricane moved in a counterclockwise loop and hit Cuba again. It then tracked toward Florida, landing near Cape Romano. After moving through the state, it hugged the coast of the Southeastern United States on its way out to sea. Due to its unusual loop, initial reports suggested it was two separate storms that developed and hit land in rapid succession. Its track was subject to much debate at the time; eventually, it was identified as a single storm. Analysis of the event gave a greater understanding of weather systems that took similar paths.",
    "Harrisonavis is an extinct genus of flamingo that lived in the Chattian and Aquitanian epochs. It contains the single species Harrisonavis croizeti. The holotype, a skull, was discovered in France in 1852. Description and taxonomy\nAlthough first reported in 1852 by paleontologist Paul Gervais, the fossil was not described in detail and was lost. Several fragments of bills were attributed to Harrisonavis in the subsequent years. In 2015, another skull (specimen ML StG 203bis) was discovered in Saint-Gérand-le-Puy. This skull resembles that of a modern flamingo, albeit with a straighter beak. Based on this fossil, H. croizeti is the earliest known species of flamingo that filter feeds, and is considered to be closely related to modern flamingos. It was thus initially named as a species of the living flamingo genus Phoenicopterus. Harrison and Walker, who described one bill fragment in 1976, moved it to a new genus, Gervaisia, but the name was already in use for a millipede. Kashin renamed the genus to Harrisonavis in 1978.",

Its  of coastline include the African conjunction of the western and eastern parts of the Mediterranean Basin. Tunisia is home to Africa's northernmost point, Cape Angela; and its capital and largest city is Tunis, located on its northeastern coast, which lends the country its name. From early antiquity, Tunisia was inhabited by the indigenous Berbers.

A major mercantile empire and a military rival of the Roman Republic, Carthage was defeated by the Romans in 146 BC, who occupied Tunisia for most of the next 800 years, introducing Christianity and leaving architectural legacies like the amphitheatre of El Jem. After several attempts starting in 647, Muslims conquered all of Tunisia by 697, bringing Islam and Arab culture to the local inhabitants.

    "Scotland Yard (officially New Scotland Yard) is the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, the territorial police force responsible for policing the 32 boroughs of London. Its name derives from the location of the original Metropolitan Police headquarters at 4 Whitehall Place, which had a rear entrance on a street called Great Scotland Yard. The Scotland Yard entrance became the public entrance to the police station, and over time the street and the Metropolitan Police became synonymous. The New York Times wrote in 1964 that, just as Wall Street gave its name to New York's financial district, Scotland Yard became the name for police activity in London. The force moved from Great Scotland Yard in 1890, to a newly completed building on the Victoria Embankment, and the name \"New Scotland Yard\" was adopted for the new headquarters. An adjacent building was completed in 1906. A third building was added in 1940.

    "Federal common law is a term of United States law used to describe common law that is developed by the federal courts, instead of by the courts of the various states. The United States is the only country to combine the creation of common law doctrines with a complete federalism, wherein the national supreme court has virtually no power to review state court decisions to determine whether the state courts have followed state laws. The High Court of Australia is sometimes said to have federal common law, but because all state and territorial courts are directly appealable to the High Court, this is indistinguishable from a general common law. In contrast, the United States Supreme Court has effectively barred the creation of federal common law in areas traditionally under the authority of state courts. Nevertheless, there are several areas where federal common law continues to govern. The Swift doctrine\nUntil 1938, federal courts in America followed the doctrine set forth in the 1842 case of Swift v. Tyson. In that case, the United States Supreme Court held that federal courts hearing cases brought under their diversity jurisdiction (allowing them to hear cases between parties from different U.S. states) had to apply the statutory law of the states, but not the common law developed by state courts. Instead, the Supreme Court permitted the federal courts to make their own common law based on general principles of law.",
    "Armstrong Field was a baseball park located in Dallas, Texas on the campus of Southern Methodist University located where Westcott Field now stands. It first hosted SMU football from 1915 through 1925 (Ownby Stadium opened in 1926). It was the home of the SMU baseball team (1919–1980) for many years though at least the final four seasons were played off campus. The Mustangs, Southwest Conference participants, were a team of futility during their time at Armstrong Field, scarcely in competition to win the conference. Armstrong Field did have the advantage of being located next to an outdoor school swimming pool. Legend has it that collegians would sit in the two rows at the top of the stands to see the women at the pool instead of watching the ballgame. Some were hit with foul balls due to their concentration on the women at the pool. The pool helped augment attendance by 40%. Armstrong Field was closed after the 1976 season, but before the last game the players stole home plate and concealed it in the storage area of Ownby Stadium. The plate was signed by the players and ended up in the SMU sports information division. The final four years (1977–1980) of SMU Mustangs baseball were played at Reverchon Park before the baseball program was phased out.

    "\"Hit 'Em Up\" is a diss song by hip hop artist 2Pac, featuring the Outlawz. It is the B-side to the single \"How Do U Want It\", released on June 4, 1996. The song's lyrics contain vicious insults to several East Coast rappers, chiefly Shakur's former-friend-turned-rival, The Notorious B.I.G. (also referred  colloquially to as Biggie Smalls). The song was recorded at Can Am Studios in 1996. There is a previous version of this song recorded in October 1995. Reporter Chuck Philips, who interviewed Shakur at Can Am, described the song as \"a caustic anti–East Coast jihad in which the rapper threatens to eliminate Biggie, Puff, and a slew of Bad Boy artists and other New York acts.\" The song was produced by long-time collaborator Johnny \"J\". The video, itself described as infamous, includes impersonations of Biggie, Puffy and M.A.F.I.A. member Lil' Kim. \"Hit 'Em Up\" had a large role in exacerbating the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry. Following its release, the East Coast rappers insulted in the song responded through tracks of their own. The controversy surrounding the song is due in part to Shakur's murder in a drive-by-shooting only three months after its release.",

    "The Higher Life movement, also known as the Keswick movement or Keswickianism, is a Protestant theological tradition within evangelical Christianity that espouses a distinct teaching on the doctrine of entire sanctification. Its name comes from the Higher Christian Life, a book by William Boardman published in 1858, as well as from the town in which the movement was first promoted—Keswick Conventions in Keswick, England, the first of which was a tent revival in 1875 and continues to this day. The main idea in the Keswickian theology of the Higher Life movement is that the Christian should move on from his initial conversion experience to also experience a second work of God in his life. This work of God is called “entire sanctification,” “the second blessing,” “the second touch,” “being filled with the Holy Spirit,” and various other terms.  Higher Life teachers promote the idea that Christians who receive this blessing from God can live a more holy, that is less sinful or even a sinless, life. The Keswick approach seeks to provide a mediating and biblically balanced solution to the problem of subnormal Christian experience. The “official” teaching has been that every believer in this life is left with the natural proclivity to sin and will do so without the countervailing influence of the Holy Spirit.",

COVID-19 and impeachment \nIn August 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, he joined John Becker, Candice Keller, and Nino Vitale in sponsoring a move to impeach against Mike DeWine, Ohio's Republican governor. The move was widely and immediately panned on both sides of the aisle and by legal scholars and commentators. Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken \"issued a scathing condemnation of the trio of conservatives\", calling the move “a baseless, feeble attempt at creating attention for themselves.” Ohio House Speaker, Republican Bob Cupp, called it an \"imprudent attempt\" to cause \"a state constitutional crisis\". Legal scholar Jonathan Entin said the proposal \"means that we’ve distorted our understanding both of what impeachment is supposed to do and how people – especially, elected officials – are supposed to disagree with each other. Do we really want to say that the government can’t act in an emergency because the officials are afraid that if they do anything, they’ll be removed from office? Of course, if they don’t do anything, maybe the response is going to be ‘Well you should be impeached for not acting.' CNN's Chris Cillizza analyzed it as one of several examples of how Donald Trump had politicized public health matters to the point Republican lawmakers felt they needed to make extreme and pointless moves in order to satisfy the base.

The French colonization beginning in the 16th century established a Roman Catholic francophone population in New France, especially Acadia (later Lower Canada, now Nova Scotia and Quebec). British colonization brought waves of Anglicans and other Protestants to Upper Canada, now Ontario.

With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state despite the majority of Canadians claiming an affiliation with Christianity. The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, but still believe in God. The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and the state. On Sundays, between 15 and 25 percent of Catholic Canadians attend Mass (15 percent weekly attenders and another 9 percent monthly).",

Founded by the Augustinian friars in 1951, it is one of the network of Augustinian schools in other parts of the world and welcomes pupils of all denominations. History\nAt the request of the Diocese of Lancaster, the Order of Saint Augustine founded Austin Friars School, a day and boarding grammar school, to provide a Catholic education for boys in Cumbria and the city of Carlisle. The property was originally used by the Sisters of the Sacred Heart who had founded a school there before leaving for Newcastle upon Tyne in 1903 (and subsequently establishing Sacred Heart Catholic High School) and the Poor Sisters of Nazareth who ran an orphanage. It was then acquired by the Augustinians in 1951 and has been occupied by the school ever since. Girls were admitted in 1986. Boarding ceased in 1998 due to declining interest.",
    "Amphibious caterpillar refers to over 40 species of semiaquatic caterpillars endemic to Hawaii that are the only insects that live as readily in water as on land. In 2010, Daniel Rubinoff and Patrick Schmitz at the University of Hawaii at Manoa first described the amphibious habits of the larvae in the moth genus Hyposmocoma of the family Cosmopterigidae. Young of each species thrive both underwater in rushing streams and exposed to air on rocks poking out of the water.  Rubinoff states,  “These species are at least as different as chimpanzees are from us”. While some other caterpillars can survive for short periods under water, they are possibly the only air-breather that can thrive exclusively there. \"No other animal that breathes air can handle being submerged for a month,\" he says. These caterpillars don’t have gills or anything that covers the trachea to operate  marine mammals' surface-to-breathe technique for respiration. Instead they appear to absorb oxygen directly through pores in their \"skin\" from the enveloping water. The caterpillars require flowing water to provide sufficient oxygen. They spin \"silk\" tethers to attach themselves to the downstream sides of rocks to keep from washing away.",

    "Orthonairovirus is a genus  of viruses in the family Nairoviridae of the order Bunyavirales that include viruses with circular, negative-sense single stranded RNA.  It got its name from the Nairobi sheep disease that affects the gastrointestinal tracts of sheep and goats.  The vast majority, and perhaps all viruses in this genus are tick-borne viruses that can have human or other vertebrate hosts. Structure \nThe virions for viruses in this genus have a spherical shape.  They range in size from about 80–120 nm in diameter, with 50% of their weight attributed to proteins and 20–30% of their weight attributed to lipids.  The ribonucleocapsid is filamentous,  having a length of about 200-300 nm and a width of about 2–2.5 nm.\nThese nucleocapsids are surrounded by a single envelope that has projections made of glycoproteins protruding from its surface.  These projections evenly cover the surface of the virion, and are about 5–10 nm long. They aid in attachment to the host receptor in replication.",

He emigrated to France in 1959 and found work first in Marseille and then in Paris, variously as a cook, farm labourer, waiter, dockworker and delivery man. He found that he and other African immigrants were unable to gain work in their chosen professions, and in the menial jobs they could find, they were paid less than the French. The difficulty of making a living during this time, as well as the racism he experienced, eventually provided inspiration for his films, including Soleil O and Les 'bicots-Nègres' vos voisins.",

    "Migration studies is the academic study of human migration. Migration studies is an interdisciplinary field which draws on anthropology, prehistory, history, economics, law, sociology and postcolonial studies. Origin and development of migration studies\nMigration studies did not develop along a uni-linear path and it has developed with significantly different trajectories in different academic cultures and traditions. Migration studies does not exist as a self-contained discipline and instead finds its heritage in a variety of places. Developments in the sociology of migration, the study of the history of human migration, theories and policies concerning labour migration, and postcolonial studies all fed into the growth of migration studies. The development of migration studies is also bound up with the growth in interdisciplinary pursuits which has resulted from the popularisation of postmodern thought in the past thirty years. In recent years, scholarship which takes interest in humanitarian issues has become increasingly popular. In part, this reflects displacement and refugee movements which have resulted from conflicts throughout the end of the 20th century and at the turn of the 21st century.",
    "Made-to-measure (MTM) typically refers to custom clothing that is cut and sewn using a standard-sized base pattern. Suits and sport coats are the most common garments made-to-measure. The fit of a made-to-measure garment is expected to be superior to that of a ready-to-wear garment because  made-to-measure garments are constructed to fit each customer individually based on a few body measurements to customize the pre-existing pattern. \nMade-to-measure garments always involve some form of standardization in the pattern and manufacturing, whereas bespoke tailoring is  entirely made from scratch based on a customer's specifications with far more attention to minute fit details and using multiple fittings during the construction process. \nAll else being equal, a made-to-measure garment will be more expensive than a ready-to-wear garment but cheaper than a bespoke one. \"Custom made\" most often refers to MTM. Overview \nTo order a made-to-measure garment, the customer's measurements are first taken by a made-to-measure retailer. Then a base pattern is selected that most closely corresponds with the customer’s measurements. This base pattern is altered to match the customer’s measurements. The garment is constructed from this altered pattern.",

Gurney won races in the Formula One, Indy Car, NASCAR, Can-Am, and Trans-Am Series. Gurney is the first of three drivers to have won races in Sports Cars (1958), Formula One (1962), NASCAR (1963), and Indy cars (1967), the other two being Mario Andretti and Juan Pablo Montoya. In 1967, after winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans together with A. J. Foyt, Gurney spontaneously sprayed champagne while celebrating on the podium, which thereafter became a custom at many motorsports events. As owner of All American Racers, he was the first to put a simple right-angle extension on the upper trailing edge of the rear wing. This device, called a Gurney flap, increases downforce and, if well designed, imposes only a relatively small increase in aerodynamic drag. At the 1968 German Grand Prix, he became the first driver ever to use a full face helmet in Grand Prix racing.",

    "The Nakajima Ki-87 was a Japanese high-altitude fighter-interceptor of World War II. It was a single seat, exhaust-driven turbo-supercharged engined, low-wing monoplane with a conventional undercarriage. Design and development\nThe Ki-87 was developed in response to American B-29 Superfortress raids on the Home Islands. It followed up on earlier research by Nakajima and the Technical Division of Imperial Army Headquarters into boosting a large radial engine with an exhaust-driven turbo-supercharger, which had begun in 1942, well before the B-29 raids began. The efforts of the Technical Division of Imperial Army Headquarters eventually culminated into the Tachikawa Ki-94-I, while the Ki-87 was developed as a fall-back project, using less stringent requirements. Nakajima started in July 1943 with the construction of three prototypes, to be completed between November 1944 and January 1945, and seven pre-production aircraft, to be delivered by April 1945. The Technical Division of Imperial Army Headquarters made itself felt during the development of the Ki-87 prototype when they insisted upon placing the turbo-supercharger in the rear-fuselage, and from the sixth prototype the Nakajima fighter was to have that arrangement. The Ki-87 had a rearward folding undercarriage to accommodate the storage of ammunition for the cannons, which were mounted in the wing.",

Throughout the 19th century, Manhattanville bustled around a wharf active with ferry and daily river conveyances. It was the first station on the Hudson River Railroad running north from the city, and the hub of daily stage coach, omnibus and streetcar lines. Situated near Bloomingdale Road, its hotels, houses of entertainment and post office made it an alluring destination of suburban retreat from the city, yet its direct proximity to the Hudson River also made it an invaluable industrial entry point for construction materials and other freight bound for Upper Manhattan. With the construction of road and railway viaducts over the valley in which the town sat, Manhattanville, increasingly absorbed into the growing city, became a marginalized industrial area.

    "The Display Handicap was an American long distance Thoroughbred horse race held annually from 1955 through 1990. A race for 3-year-olds and up, it was run at the Jamaica Race Course from inception through 1958 at a distance of 2 miles. In 1959 the race was moved permanently to the newly renovated Aqueduct Racetrack after which the Jamaica track was closed and the property sold to real estate developers. From 1959 through 1969 it was contested at 2 miles then its final two decades was run at a distance of 2¼ miles. The Display Handicap was traditionally held on the last day of racing in New York City for that calendar year. It began ending the season on December 31, 1976, when year-round racing was introduced in New York. The race was aptly named for Display, a son of Fair Play (as was Man o' War, elected #1 in the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century). Display was noted for being able to carry heavy weights over marathon distances successfully. The Display Handicap was distinctive for the fact that many horses who normally ran in claiming races (but possessed abundant stamina) would be entered in it, and a few such horses went on to win the event. In 1978, Seaney Bear nosed out Framarco, another horse who ran mostly in claiming races. They competed in one of the two divisions of the race which were run in that year, necessitated by an unusually high number of horses entered in the race. Although the race was for 3-year-olds and up, it was rare for a 3-year-old to win it; when In the Ruff won the 1983 running he became the first 3-year-old winner of the Display since Dean Carl in 1963, and the first ever at the 2¼-mile distance.",

    "Franklinton is a neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio, just west of its downtown. Settled in 1797, Franklinton is the first American settlement in Franklin County, and was the county seat until 1824. As the city of Columbus grew, the city annexed and incorporated the existing settlement in 1859. Franklinton is bordered by the Scioto River on the north and east, Harmon Avenue on the east, Stimmel Road and Greenlawn Avenue on the south, and Interstate 70 on the west. Its main thoroughfare is West Broad Street, one of the city's two main roads. A portion of the neighborhood is sometimes called The Bottoms because much of the land is subject to flooding from the Scioto and Olentangy rivers, and a floodwall is required to contain the rivers and protect the area from floods. The low-lying bottom land was well suited for farming, with the river serving as a direct connection to the Ohio River. The floodwall, completed in 2004, spurred developments in East Franklinton. The projects involved demolition of three public housing projects, displacing its former residents to other areas. The developments are predominantly luxury mixed-use buildings, spurring significant gentrification in the neighborhood.",
    "Evolutionary biology  is the subfield of biology that studies the evolutionary processes (natural selection, common descent, speciation) that produced the diversity of life on Earth. Simply, it is also defined as the study of the history of life forms on Earth. Evolution is based on the theory that all species are related and they gradually change over time. In a population, the genetic variations affect the physical characteristics i.e. phenotypes of an organism. These changes in the phenotypes will be an advantage to some organisms, which will then be passed onto their offspring. Peppered Moth and Flightless birds are some examples of evolution in species over many generations. In the 1930s, the discipline of evolutionary biology emerged through what Julian Huxley called the modern synthesis of understanding, from previously unrelated fields of biological research, such as genetics and ecology, systematics, and paleontology. A person who studies Evolutionary biology is called an Evolutionary biologist. The importance of studying Evolutionary biology is mainly to understand the principles behind the origin and extinction of species. The investigational range of current research widened to encompass the genetic architecture of adaptation, molecular evolution, and the different forces that contribute to evolution, such as sexual selection, genetic drift, and biogeography. Moreover, the newer field of evolutionary developmental biology (\"evo-devo\") investigates how embryogenesis, the development of the embryo, is controlled, thus yielding a wider synthesis that integrates developmental biology with the fields of study covered by the earlier evolutionary synthesis.",

    "In statistics and econometrics, a cross-sectional regression is a type of regression in which the explained and explanatory variables are all associated with the same single period or point in time.  This type of cross-sectional analysis is in contrast to a time-series regression or longitudinal regression in which the variables are considered to be associated with a sequence of points in time. For example, in economics a regression to explain and predict money demand (how much people choose to hold in the form of the most liquid assets) could be conducted with either cross-sectional or time series data. A cross-sectional regression would have as each data point an observation on a particular individual's money holdings, income, and perhaps other variables at a single point in time, and different data points would reflect different individuals at the same point in time. In contrast, a regression using time series would have as each data point an entire economy's money holdings, income, etc. at one point in time, and different data points would be drawn on the same economy but at different points in time.",

    "Slingerland is a United States manufacturer of drums.  The company was founded in 1912 and enjoyed several decades of prominence in the industry before the 1980s.  After ceasing operation in the early 1980s, Slingerland was acquired by Gibson, who briefly revived it and owned it until November 2019, before selling Slingerland to DW Drums, who have announced the intention of re-launching the brand.  Slingerland is strongly associated with jazz drummers, such as Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich, who played signature instruments made by the company.  Although primarily known for its drums, in the 1930s Slingerland also produced electric and acoustic guitars, violins, mandolins, banjos and ukuleles. History \nThe \"Slingerland Banjo Company\" was founded by Henry Heanon (H.H.) Slingerland (1875–1946) in 1912. Slingerland had won a correspondence school of music in a card game aboard one of the gaming boats that once cruised Lake Michigan.

    "Sociocultural evolution, sociocultural evolutionism or cultural evolution are theories of sociobiology and cultural evolution that describe how societies and culture change over time. Whereas sociocultural development traces processes that tend to increase the complexity of a society or culture, sociocultural evolution also considers process that can lead to decreases in complexity (degeneration) or that can produce variation or proliferation without any seemingly significant changes in complexity (cladogenesis). Sociocultural evolution is \"the process by which structural reorganization is affected through time, eventually producing a form or structure which is qualitatively different from the ancestral form\". Most of the 19th-century and some 20th-century approaches to socioculture aimed to provide models for the evolution of humankind as a whole, arguing that different societies have reached different stages of social development. The most comprehensive attempt to develop a general theory of social evolution centering on the development of sociocultural systems, the work of Talcott Parsons (1902–1979), operated on a scale which included a theory of world history. Another attempt, on a less systematic scale, originated from the 1970s with the world-systems approach of Immanuel Wallerstein (1930-2019) and his followers.\n \nMore recent approaches focus on changes specific to individual societies and reject the idea that cultures differ primarily according to how far each one has moved along some presumed linear scale of social progress. Most modern archaeologists and cultural anthropologists work within the frameworks of neoevolutionism, sociobiology, and modernization theory.",

After his death in 1975, Spain transitioned into a democracy. During this time period Spain was officially known as the Spanish State . The nature of the regime evolved and changed during its existence. Months after the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, Franco emerged as the dominant rebel military leader and was proclaimed head of state on 1 April 1939, ruling a dictatorship over the territory controlled by the Nationalist faction. The 1937 Unification Decree, which merged all parties supporting the rebel side, led to Nationalist Spain becoming a single-party regime under the FET y de las JONS. The end of the war in 1939 brought the extension of the Franco rule to the whole country and the exile of Republican institutions. The Francoist dictatorship originally took a form described as \"fascistized dictatorship\", or \"semi-fascist regime\", showing clear influence of fascism in fields such as labor relations, the autarkic economic policy, aesthetics, and the single-party system. As time went on, the regime opened up and became closer to developmental dictatorships, although it always preserved residual fascist trappings.",

    "Matvei Fyodorovich Shkiryatov (Russian: Матвей Фёдорович Шкирятов; 15 August 1883 — 18 January 1954) was a Communist Party official and functionary who rose to power in the Soviet Union during the rule of Joseph Stalin. His entire career was spent imposing party discipline through the Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Though far less well known than successive chiefs of the Soviet police, such as Nikolai Yezhov or Lavrentiy Beria, he was arguably as steeply involved as either of them in the repression during the Stalin years. Unlike them, escaped arrest or public notoriety. Early career\nMatvei Shkiryatov was the son of a peasant, born in a village called Vishnyakovo, in Tula Province. He joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1906, and worked in the illegal party organisation in Moscow, Rostov-on-Don and Tula. He was arrested repeatedly, but avoided being deported to Siberia or held in prison for very long. There is no evidence that these arrests were for political activity. He was drafted into the imperial army in 1915. After the February Revolution, he was elected to the executive of the Moscow and Tula soviets. In 1918-20, he was secretary of the Moscow branch of the Garment Workers' Union.",
    "Transcript poetry is a research method of data collection by which researchers use selected parts of transcripts and create poems that represent the original text in a new way. It is regarded as a collaborative approach to qualitative research that promotes the inclusion of the participant in the method of data collection (Burdick, M., 2011). Qualitative researchers are beginning to recognize the value of using transcription poetry as a way of giving more \"voice\" to the research participants’ experiences (Bhattacharya, K., 2013). Its value is by creating a \"snapshot\" of the original interview text using an art centred approach that makes for a more emotional impact statement to the reader. In her article, Burdick (2011) states, \"These poems not only reveal critical insights and perspectives of our 2 participants, they also aim to convey intrinsic details of feelings, critical experiences, and/or epiphanies in their lived experiences.\" History\nIn the early 1990s, sociologist, Laurel Richardson started incorporating poetry into the research method as a way of bringing more participant voice into the qualitative research method. Richardson took notice that the poetic method was not warmly embraced by the scientific community as it did not follow the already established norms and practices of research methodology. However, Richardson saw that a change was occurring, \"as these researchers begin to examine issues of culture, power, and authority in new ways (2011). In her article, Burdick (2011) wrote, \"poetry offers something \"profoundly different\" to the world of educational research. When using poetry, researchers must be willing to trust the process more than finding the right answer. Poetry is meant to focus on different questions and contribute a new narrative to how knowledge is perceived and created.\"",

    "In marketing, a fixed value-added resource (FVAR) is an item that, whilst seeming unrelated to the core product, adds value to the core product or service offering. The concept originated from entrepreneur Edward A. Blake in his attempt to quickly explain the purpose of a resource he was promoting to online service providers. Categorization\nIn order for an item to be classed as an FVAR, Edward A Blake, who originated the concept, set out the following three requirements:\nThe item must be fixed in nature. That is, an item to be found on a constant basis within the core product,\nThe item must not be directly related in content to that of the core product. For instance, a 'Model of the Day' feature would be an FVAR if placed within a daily tabloid newspaper such as The Sun, but could not be classified as such if featured within a men's magazine such as Playboy.\nThe item must add some form of distinct value to the existing value proposition of the core product. For instance, many people subscribe to a daily newspaper in the knowledge that they will derived added value from the FVAR, such as the daily crossword puzzle, irrespective of the overall quality of that day's newspaper.",

    "Agkistrodon taylori is species of venomous snake, a pitviper (Crotalinae) found only in northeastern Mexico. The standardized names are Taylor's cantil (English) and Metapil (Spanish), although it is sometimes called the ornate cantil as well as several other colloquial names. It was named in honor of American herpetologist Edward Harrison Taylor. It is a stout, medium sized snake, averaging 64-90 cm. in length. Taylor's cantils have prominent light and dark stripes on the head, with a pattern of black and gray-brown bands on the body, accented with white, yellow, and orange. They are sexually dimorphic, with males being significantly darker than females. Some older individuals, particularly males, may grow darker, nearly black with age. It is a viviparous species, with typical litters of 3 to 10 live young. Taylor's cantils are uncommon to rare snakes in the wild and  listed as a threatened species in Mexico. It occurs in a variety of habitats on the Gulf Coastal Plain and lower foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental, including thorn scrub, tropical deciduous forest, and grasslands, sometimes said to prefer ecotones between scrubland and forest in the vicinity of rocky limestone outcroppings. Although not overtly aggressive, it is known to be very defensive with a volatile temper and may be quick to strike when approached, threatened, or restrained. No case reports of human envenomations have been published. Its venom is believed to be similar to its close relative, the cantil Agkistrodon bilineatus, and potentially fatal.",

    "Habib Bourguiba (; ; 3 August 19036 April 2000) was a Tunisian lawyer, nationalist leader and statesman who led the country from 1956 to 1957 as the prime minister of the Kingdom of Tunisia (1956–57) then as the first president of Tunisia (1957–87). Prior to his presidency, he led the nation to independence from France, ending the 75-year-old protectorate and earning the title of \"Supreme Combatant\". Born in Monastir to a poor family, he attended Sadiki College then Lycée Carnot in Tunis, before obtaining his baccalaureate in 1924. He graduated from the University of Paris in 1927 and returned to Tunis to practice law. In the early 1930s, he became involved in anti-colonial and Tunisian national politics, joining the Destour party and co-founding the Neo Destour in 1934. He rose as a key figure of the independence movement and was repeatedly arrested by the colonial administration. His involvement in the riots of 9 April 1938 resulted in his exile to Marseille during World War II. \n \nIn 1945, Bourguiba was released and moved to Cairo, Egypt, to seek the support of the Arab League. He returned to the country in 1949 and rose to prominence as the leader of the national movement. Although initially committed to peaceful negotiations with the French government, he had an effective role in the armed unrest that started in 1952 when they proved to be unsuccessful. He was arrested and imprisoned on La Galite Island for two years, before being exiled in France. There, he led negotiations with Prime minister Pierre Mendès France and obtained internal autonomy agreements in exchange for the end of the unrest. Bourguiba returned victorious to Tunis on 1 June 1955, but was challenged by Salah Ben Youssef in the party leadership. Ben Youssef and his supporters disagreed with Bourguiba's \"soft\" policies and demanded full independence of the Maghreb. This resulted in a civil war that opposed Bourguibists, who favored a stepwise policy and modernism, and Youssefists, the conservative Arab nationalist supporters of Ben Youssef. The conflict ended with the Sfax Congress of 1955 in favor of Bourguiba.",

    "Edgewater Park is a small  waterside co-op community of 675 single-family homes in the Throggs Neck section of the Bronx, north of the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95) near the Throgs Neck Bridge. Its beaches overlook Long Island Sound. Its sister communities are Silver Beach, south of the Cross Bronx Expressway, as well as Harding Park. History\nEdgewater Park once housed a mansion built by George T. Adee in 1856. He eventually leased the land to an Irish immigrant who was a member of St. Ann's Episcopal Church in Morrisania and invited church youth to camp on the grounds which became known as Edgewater Camp. Campsites eventually developed into bungalows and by around 1918 a full-fledged bungalow had developed along the coast areas while other sections remained farmland and grazing land. Ruts from early auto traffic became roads. After World War I the community was divided into sections A, B, C, after the names of Army camps; D and E Sections were added later. In 1954, Shaw died. By this time, Edgewater Camp had become a community of full-time residents and became known as \"Park of Edgewater\" or \"Edgewater Park.\" The community became a co-op in 1988.",

His songwriting partnership with Mick Jagger is one of the most successful in history. Richards is widely considered one of the greatest guitarists of all time. His career spans over six decades and his guitar playing style has been a trademark of the Rolling Stones throughout the band's career. Richards gained press notoriety for his romantic involvements and illicit drug use — and was often portrayed as a countercultural figure.  Richards was born in and grew up in Dartford, Kent. He studied at the Dartford Technical School and Sidcup Art College. After graduating, Richards befriended Jagger, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts and Brian Jones, and joined the Rolling Stones. As a member of the Rolling Stones, Richards is the only member, aside from Jagger, to sing lead on some Stones songs.

The organisation claims to be a syncretic fulfilment of Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Hindu prophecy, with Shahi depicted as the messianic figure of many religions, given the title of Mehdi, Messiah, and Kalki Avatar as well as the generic \"Awaited One\" prophesied by other religions.

    "Drospirenone/ethinylestradiol/levomefolic acid (EE/DRSP/LMF), sold under the brand names Beyaz among others, is a combination of ethinylestradiol (EE), an estrogen, drospirenone (DRSP), a progestogen, antimineralocorticoid, and antiandrogen, and levomefolic acid (LMF), a form of vitamin B9, which is used as a birth control pill to prevent pregnancy in women. The formulation contains folate as the calcium salt of levomefolic acid to lower the risk of complications such as fetal neural tube defects should the medication fail as a form of birth control. EE/DRSP/LMF was approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 24 September 2010. Medical uses\nStudies have shown its uses to be oral contraception, lessening premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and treatment of moderate acne in women over 14 years of age who choose an oral contraceptive for contraception. Five clinical trials were carried out for these labeled uses, “including a one-year contraceptive efficacy study, two 3-cycle studies in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and two 6-cycle studies in women with moderate acne.” The drug combination will also increase folate levels due to its extra ingredient, levomefolic calcium.

The area was 57,422 m², of which 6,794 m² were covered by lakes. Geology\nIts north-western portion belonged orographically and geologically to the Finland region; it is thickly dotted with hills reaching 1,000 ft. in altitude, and diversified by numberless smaller ridges and hollows running from northwest to south-east. The rest of the governorate was a flat plateau sloping towards the marshy lowlands of the south. The geological structure was very varied. Granites, syenites, and diorites, covered with Laurentian metamorphic slates, occurred extensively in the north-west. Near Lake Onega they were overlain with Devonian sandstones and limestones, yielding marble and sandstone for building; to the south of that lake carboniferous limestones and clays made their appearance. The whole was sheeted with boulder-clay, the bottom moraine of the great ice-sheet of the last glacial period. The entire region bears traces of glaciation, either in the shape of scratchings and elongated grooves on the rocks, or of eskers (asar, selgas) running parallel to the glacial striations.",

He said, \"It started off that way but moved into an exploration of fathers in those poor neighbourhoods.\" It ended up with the songs based on a family Keyes knew as child that lived in the James Cook housing commission flats in Waterloo in Sydney. \"I thought I would write about the dad, because I was pissed off with narcissistic blokes where everything they do is fuelled by self-interest but every time it got to mentioning the kids I would start writing a song about them.\" The main characters are father, wife-beater, and drug-dealer Jim Salmon; nervous mother Jenny; drug-using son Jimmy, and daughter Iris.

The first song depicts Jenny and Jim meeting. Keyes said, \"It's pretty linear. You say the term concept album and you immediately think of Rick Wakeman and Richard Burton doing the narration. It's something I like to do. It's probably a good discipline for me. I like to come up with an idea of a theme and then create the songs to fit in it.

    "Transitional bilingualism is the shift from being bilingual, knowing two different languages, to only speaking one leading language. This usually happens over a period of time and can be seen within a few generations.  There are families with immigrant grandparents who speak primarily their native language and some of the new country's language. Their children then speak both languages, but the grandchildren only speak the dominant or preferred language of the new location. The United States provides many examples of this phenomenon. For example, a woman born and raised in Mexico moved to the United States and learned a bit of English and spoke a great deal of Spanish as well.  Her daughter, born and reared in the U.S. was equally fluent in both Spanish and English (bilingual). The grandchild of the Mexican immigrant, who was born and has been reared in the U.S., speaks only English.  This process is due to the pressure that is put on the individuals by the society of the new environment. They cannot survive well without the primary language spoken in their new home and eventually, since fewer and fewer people speak the \"old\" native language, it is not used as often, as it is not a necessity, and is lost.",

Forster, one of his ancestors, was a surgeon in the Royal Navy and moved to Virginia in 1745. His paternal grandfather moved the family from Virginia to South Carolina, and Smith was born on November 27, 1864, near Cokesburg, to James Francis Smith, a planter and traveling preacher. James P. Smith was educated by his parents and elder brother Charles Forster Smith. In the 1870s, the family moved to Spartanburg, South Carolina, where James obtained a bachelor's degree at Wofford College in 1884. Smith then attended Vanderbilt University until 1887, for a master's degree. He subsequently taught high school science and mathematics in Nashville, Tennessee for two years. Smith then worked for the Arkansas Geological Survey under John Casper Branner. Between 1890 and 1892, Smith studied at the University of Göttingen.

    "Oren Burbank Cheney (December 10, 1816 – December 22, 1903) was an American politician, minister, and statesman who was a key figure in the abolitionist movement in the United States during the later 19th century. Along with textile tycoon Benjamin Bates, he founded the first coeducational university in New England (the Bates College) which is widely considered his magnum opus. Cheney is one of the most extensively covered subjects of Neoabolitionism, for his public denouncement of slavery, involuntary servitude, and advocation for fair and equal representation, egalitarianism, and personal sovereignty. Cheney's main social ideology was that of egalitarianism; he personally voiced his disdain for racial inequality, social elitism, and socioeconomic depravation regularly, in controversial speeches and articles. He was ordained a minister in his early twenties, became the headmaster at Parsonsfield, Maine, and illegally harbored and transferred slaves to safety during the 1840s in New Hampshire–an action punishable with a decade's jail time by the federal Fugitive Slave acts. His religious community work garnered him widespread support, culminating in his nomination for a seat in the Maine House of Representatives without his knowledge. Having been told he was nominated and elected on his way to his induction ceremony, Cheney would go on to be an able Free Soil legislator. His first bills drafted and passed supported state prohibition, advocated for temperance, regulated liquor traffic (notably the passage of the Maine Liquor Law), and provided the funds for his first school–the Lebanon Academy in Lebanon, Maine. He gave many abolitionist speeches to the legislature, which produced mixed reactions and death threats; historians have occasionally noted him as \"completely and utterly careless with his life.\"",

    "Auroroborealia is a small bodied euichthyosaurian ichthyosaur discovered on the New Siberian Islands in the Russian Arctic. The animal was likely similar in size to Hudsonelpidia, around 1 to 1.5 meters in length. Although the fragmentary nature doesn't allow to determine its exact ontogenetic state, other remains from the area suggest that it was simply a small bodied taxon. It contains a single species, Auroroborealia incognita. Discovery and naming\nThe fossils of Auroroborealia were discovered by a joint expedition of the Geological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Trofimuk Institute of Petroleum Geology and Geophysics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, during excavations in 2006 and 2009. These expeditions yielded a variety of ichthyosaurian remains from six stratigraphic levels ranging from the lower Carnian to middle Norian. Although most specimens were fragmentary, Zverkov et al. (2021) could nevertheless differentiate between a host of different ichthyosaurs. One fossil in particular, specimen ZIN PH 5/250, included cranial remains as well as anterior presacral vertebrae with associated neural arches and ribs. A bone fragment associated with the pectoral girdle is also part of this specimen. Based on this material Zverkov  et al. erected the species Aurororborealia incognita, while also describing a series of referred specimens (which however did not factor into the diagnosis of the genus).",
    "Khandoba (IAST: Khaṇḍobā), Martanda Bhairava, Malhari, or Malhar is a Hindu deity worshiped as a manifestation of Shiva mainly in the Deccan plateau of India, especially in the state of Maharashtra and North Karnataka. He is the most popular Kuladaivat (family deity) in Maharashtra and North Karnataka. He is also the patron deity of select warrior, farming castes, Dhangar community and Brahmin (priestly) castes as well as several of the hunter/gatherer tribes (Bedar, Naik) that are native to the hills and forests of this region. The sect of Khandoba has linkages with Hindu and Jain traditions, and also assimilates all communities irrespective of caste, including Muslims.

Overview\nThe Kitayatsu site is located is located on a plateau at an elevation of 145 meters that spreads out at the foot of the southeastern foot of Mount Haruna. In the year 2000, the ruins of a large fortified residence belonging to a gōzoku clan ruling the surrounding area during the Kofun period was discovered.

The site of the residence is a square 90 meters on each side, containing buildings arranged in a \"U\" shape, forming a courtyard that was open to the south. ",
    "Teungku Daud Beureueh (17 September 1899 – 10 June 1987), was the military Governor of Aceh (1945–1953) and leader of the Darul Islam rebellion in the province (1953–1963). Born in the Keumangan chiefdom of Pidie regency, he began from 1930 to champion a more modern form of Islamic school, and became a popular reformist preacher. In 1939 he established and lead the Persatuan Ulama Seluruh Aceh (PUSA), or All Aceh Islamic Scholars Association. PUSA was not initially anti-Dutch, but emerged as the principal critic of the Dutch-supported hierarchy of ulèëbalang (aristocrat-officials). Its members contacted the Japanese before their 1942 invasion, in the hope of overturning ulèëbalang rule as a reward for their support. As the Japanese saw a greater need for popular support in 1944, they transferred many judicial functions from the ulèëbalang to religious courts headed by Daud. After the Japanese surrender this conflict between religious and secular elites became violent, leading to the eclipse of the ulèëbalang and the killing of many in the Cumbok Affair of December 1945/January 1946. Daud was thereafter the most influential figure in Aceh, and his support for the Indonesian Republic's struggle against the returning Dutch helped make Aceh a bastion of the Republican cause.

    "Adolfo López Mateos (; 26 May 1909 – 22 September 1969) was a Mexican politician who became a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), after earlier opposing its precursor in 1929. He was elected President of Mexico, serving from 1958 to 1964. As president, he nationalized electric companies, created the National Commission for Free Textbooks (1959), settled the Chamizal dispute, and opened important museums such as the Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. Declaring his political philosophy to be \"left within the Constitution\", López Mateos was the first self-declared left-wing politician to hold the presidency since Lázaro Cárdenas. López Mateos was well known for being very popular among the Mexican people; alongside Cárdenas and Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, he is usually considered one of the most popular Mexican presidents of the 20th century, despite acts of repression during his administration such as the arrest of union leaders Demetrio Vallejo and Valentín Campa, and the murder of peasant leader Rubén Jaramillo and his family by the Mexican army.",
    "An identity document (also called ID or colloquially as papers) is any document that may be used to prove a person's identity. If issued in a small, standard credit card size form, it is usually called an identity card (IC, ID card, citizen card), or passport card. Some countries issue formal identity documents, as national identification cards which may be compulsory or non-compulsory, while others may require identity verification using regional identification or informal documents. When the identity document incorporates a person's photograph, it may be called photo ID. In the absence of a formal identity document, a driver's license may be accepted in many countries for identity verification. Some countries do not accept driver's licenses for identification, often because in those countries they do not expire as documents and can be old or easily forged. Most countries accept passports as a form of identification.\nSome countries require all people to have an identity document available at any time. Many countries require all foreigners to have a passport or occasionally a national identity card from their home country available at any time if they do not have a residence permit in the country.",

Kutti Puli did not receive favourable reviews from the media, but went on to perform well at the box office. Muthaiah moved on to make Komban (2015), a story set in the Ramanathapuram district, about Kombaiah Pandian, a butcher played by Karthi, and his relationship with his father-in-law, played by Rajkiran. The director, inspired by the egotistical tussles between his father and his grandmother, scripted the story straight from his own experiences. The release of Komban was mired by controversy when protesters claimed that the story revolved around animosity between different thevar caste groups and that it therefore had the potential to incite violence in southern districts of Tamil Nadu. After a brief legal battle, the film opened to positive reviews and did well commercially. Following the success of the film, he made Marudhu (2016) featuring Vishal and Sridivya in the lead roles.

    "Ship-breaking (also known as ship recycling, ship demolition, ship dismantling, or ship cracking) is a type of ship disposal involving the breaking up of ships for either a source of parts, which can be sold for re-use, or for the extraction of raw materials, chiefly scrap. Modern ships have a lifespan of 25 to 30 years before corrosion, metal fatigue and a lack of parts render them uneconomical to operate. Ship-breaking allows the materials from the ship, especially steel, to be recycled and made into new products. This lowers the demand for mined iron ore and reduces energy use in the steelmaking process. Fixtures and other equipment on board the vessels can also be reused. While ship-breaking is sustainable, there are concerns about the use by poorer countries without stringent environmental legislation. It is also labour-intensive, and considered one of the world's most dangerous industries. In 2012, roughly 1,250 ocean ships were broken down, and their average age was 26 years. In 2013, the world total of demolished ships amounted to 29,052,000 tonnes, 92% of which were demolished in Asia. As of January 2020, Alang Ship Breaking Yard (India) has the largest global share at 30%; followed by Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard (Bangladesh), China and Gadani ship-breaking yard (Pakistan).",
    "Eulalie Piccard (Saint Petersburg, 26 October 1879 - Neuchâtel, June 1957), sometimes called Eulalie Piccard Guée, was a Russian-Swiss novelist, translator and teacher, writing in French. She was one of the first literary writers to explore the transformation of Russia into the Soviet Union and the police state that was constructed there under Joseph Stalin. While her work does not approach the literary force of Alexander Solzhenitsyn or Varlam Shalamov and didn't reach major public attention, it represented an early sustained effort to expose legal and penal developments in the Soviet Union that, in the 1930s and 1940s, were little discussed outside Russian emigrant circles. When show trials and labour camps were referred to in newspapers and books at the time, the tone was generally sensational and made little attempt to connect them to Soviet political culture or to everyday life. Piccard, who was born in the late 1870s, made a teaching career in Russia, while marrying a Swiss who had come to Russia. She taught at a lyceum until fleeing with her family to Western Europe in 1925. From the twenties to the 1960s, she was active as a writer and translator (from Russian into French) and in 1929 began putting out her cycle of novels Épisodes de la Grande Tragédie Russe (\"Episodes from the Great Tragedy of Russia\") comprising:",
    "Lacusovagus (meaning \"lake wanderer\") is a genus of azhdarchoid pterodactyloid pterosaur from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil. It is based on SMNK PAL 4325, a partial upper jaw comprising sections of the skull in front of the eyes. This specimen was found in rocks of the Early Cretaceous-age (probably Aptian stage, about 120 million years ago) Nova Olinda Member of the Crato Formation. The skull was long, and unusually wide. The section in front of the combined nasal-antorbital fenestra was relatively short. Also unusual was the combination of its toothless jaws and no bony head crest. Lacusovagus was described in 2008 by Mark Witton. The type species is L. magnificens, meaning \"grand lake wanderer\", in reference to its large size—it is currently the largest pterosaur known from the Crato Formation with an estimated wingspan of . Lacusovagus shares many characteristics with the basal azhdarchoid family Chaoyangopteridae, and preliminary studies suggested it was a member of that clade.

    "Hex Enduction Hour is the fourth studio album by the English post-punk group the Fall. Released on 8March 1982, it builds on the low-fidelity production values and caustic lyrical content of their earlier recordings, and features a two-drummer lineup. Frontman Mark E. Smith establishes an abrasive Northern aesthetic built in part from the 20th century literary traditions of kitchen sink realism and magic realism. Smith described the album as an often-satirical but deliberate reaction to the contemporary music scene, a stand against \"bland bastards like Elvis Costello and Spandau Ballet ... [and] all that shit.\" Initially intended as the group's final album, recording for Hex began during a 1981 three-concert visit to Iceland, where Smith was inspired both by the otherworldliness of the island's landscape and the enthusiasm of an audience unaccustomed to visiting rock groups.

    "Point-of-sale malware (POS malware) is usually a type of malicious software (malware) that is used by cybercriminals to target point of sale (POS) and payment terminals with the intent to obtain credit card and debit card information, a card's track 1 or track 2 data and even the CVV code, by various man-in-the-middle attacks, that is the interception of the processing at the retail checkout point of sale system. The simplest, or most evasive, approach is RAM-scraping, accessing the system's memory and exporting the copied information via a remote access trojan (RAT) as this minimizes any software or hardware tampering, potentially leaving no footprints. POS attacks may also include the use of various bits of hardware: dongles, trojan card readers, (wireless) data transmitters and receivers. Being at the gateway of transactions, POS malware enables hackers to process and steal thousands, even millions, of transaction payment data, depending upon the target, the number of devices affected, and how long the attack goes undetected. This is done before or outside of the card information being (usually) encrypted and sent to the payment processor for authorization. List of POS RAM scraper malware variants",

    "HMS Sceptre (P215) was a third-batch S-class submarine built for the Royal Navy during World War II. Completed in April 1943, she spent the majority of her career in the North Sea, off Norway. After an uneventful patrol, the submarine participated in Operation Source, an attack on German battleships in Norway using small midget submarines to penetrate their anchorages and place explosive charges. However, the midget submarine that she was assigned to tow experienced technical difficulties and the mission was aborted. During her next four patrols, Sceptre attacked several ships, but only succeeded in severely damaging one. She was then ordered to tow the submarine X24, which was to attack a floating dry dock in Bergen. The operation, codenamed Guidance, encountered difficulties with the attacking submarine's charts, and the explosives were laid on a merchant ship close to the dock instead. The dock was damaged and the ship sunk, and X24 was towed back to England. Sceptre then conducted a patrol in the Bay of Biscay, sinking two German merchant ships, before being reassigned to tow X24 to Bergen again. The operation was a success, and the dry dock was sunk.

He became interested in the religious beliefs and practices of the ancient kahunas and modern practitioners of traditional, indigenous Hawaiian religion, but none of the ceremonial people talked to him so he was unable to penetrate to the inner workings of this religion. He left Hawaii in 1931, convinced that he would never learn these secrets. In 1934, he woke with a revelation that the secrets were encoded into the Hawaiian language itself. He called the religious system he developed from this revelation 'Huna' (the Hawaiian word for secret), and wrote his first book in 1936 to chronicle his beliefs. There are no accepted Hawaiian sources that refer to the word 'Huna' as a tradition of esoteric learning.",

He spent a little time in Animas, but then he was executed by the Spanish royalist army during the Mexican War of Independence. One of the attractions of Animas Trujano is the \"Danza de la Pluma\". People also celebrate the feast day of the Virgin of Guadalupe on December 12, a festival in honor of the Virgin of Rosario, the Holy Week and more.

However, over time, Animas and those three communities separated and eventually became independent. At first, Animas was only inhabited by two or three families who were sent there by San Bartolo in order to work the land. During that time, the owner of an adjacent farm called \"Hacienda del Carmen\" divided it and gave each of his workers a portion. Because this farm was close to Animas, it and its inhabitants later became a part of it. When Animas' name was changed to \"Animas Trujano\", the town was not yet a municipality. It became on February 17, 1868, after the Mexican War of Independence, that it was officially recognized as a municipality.",

    "Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 81, commonly abbreviated to Jasta 81, was a \"hunting group\" (i.e., fighter squadron) of the Luftstreitkräfte, the air arm of the Imperial German Army during World War I. The squadron would score six or more aerial victories during July/August 1917, while serving on the Eastern Front. After switching to the Western Front, Jasta 81 would score another 35 victories from May 1918 to war's end. The unit's victories came at the expense of five killed in action, three killed in flying accidents, one injured in a flying accident, three wounded in action, and three taken prisoner of war. History\nJasta 81 originated in Jagdflieger Ober-Ost, which was founded at Brest-Litovsk on 16 June 1917. It was intended for service on the Eastern Front. In August 1917, it was assigned to 8 Armee. In early May 1918, it was incorporated into Jagdgruppe 5. On 30 May 1918, it was revamped as Jasta 81. At this time, the squadron was posted to 7 Armee on the Western Front in France. On 27 June 1918, it was switched over to Jagdgruppe 4; in late July, it would return to JG 5. In late September 1918, the Jasta would be assigned to 3 Armee.",

    "Mita Taupopoki ( – 14 January 1935) was a notable Māori tribal leader of New Zealand. He identified with Ngāti Wāhiao, a hapū (subtribe) of the Tūhourangi iwi of Te Arawa. He was born near Lake Rotorua, New Zealand, probably in 1845 or 1846. His father, Hēmana Te Whareiro of Ngāti Wāhiao, lived mostly at Whakarewarewa. His mother, Kanea II, was of Tūhourangi, and the Ngāti Tūnohopū hapū of Ngāti Whakaue. In 1864 Mita joined other Te Arawa who fought for the government in the wars of the 1860s. He returned to Whakarewarewa in 1874. In 1883 he represented several hapū of Ngāti Wāhiao in the Native Land Court in a case relating to land claimed by Ngāti Whakaue, including Whakarewarewa, and succeeded in claims to the land on the east side of the Puarenga Stream at Whakarewarewa, although other land was won by Ngāti Whakaue. His success in the land court contributed to a recognition of his leadership among the wider Tūhourangi, in addition to within Ngāti Wāhiao. The 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera killed many Tūhourangi, and survivors took refuge with Mita and his people at Whakarewarewa and Ōhinemutu. Mita continued to act in the Native Land Court, representing Tūhourangi, and in 1887 won recognition of their claims of the 211,000-acre Rotomahana–Parekārangi block. In 1910 he toured Australia, England and the United States with Maggie Papakura's cultural group. He died in hospital in Rotorua on 14 January 1935.",
    "Marvel Cave is a National Natural Landmark located just west of Branson, Missouri, on top of Roark Mountain in Stone County. The cave was known by the Osage Indians in the early 16th century, after a tribe member fell through the cave's main entrance, a sinkhole. There is evidence that in 1541 the Spanish explored the cave, but the first recorded expedition was in 1869, led by Henry T. Blow. The unofficial Stone County chapter of Bald Knobbers, a local group of vigilantes, were rumored to have taken people to the top of Roark Mountain, and thrown them in the sink hole. Marvel Cave was originally called Marble Cave, after explorers in 1882 saw what they thought was marble on the cave's ceiling. This started the Marble Cave Mining Company, although later it was realized that there was never any marble in the cave. The Marble Cave Mining Company ceased all operations after only four and a half years. William Lynch purchased the cave in 1889, and soon after opened the cave to the public. In 1950, Hugo Herschend leased the cave for 99 years. The Herschends made renovations to the cave, and later opened a theme park, Silver Dollar City, on the surface above the cave. Marvel Cave is known for being one of the largest caves in Missouri, having one of the largest cave entry rooms (the Cathedral Room) of any cave in North America, and for being one of the longest running tourist attractions in the Ozarks.",

He is remembered as a national hero in Iran who organized popular resistance against the British troops which had invaded Iran in 1915. Rais Ali, son of Rais Mohammad, was born in 1882 in the suburb of Bushehr. In the age of constitutionalism he was 24, chivalrous, brave, unparalleled in sincerity and famous for patriotism and reliance upon God.

    "\"Coming to Homerica\" is the twenty-first and final episode of the twentieth season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 17, 2009. The episode title is a parody of the 1988 film Coming to America. The storyline is a pick on illegal immigration to the United States, complete with self-appointed vigilantes and building a fence to prevent it. Tying in with the episode's subject of Norwegian-descended settlers, its first US broadcast coincided with the Norwegian Constitution Day. Plot\nKrusty the Clown is informed that the Krusty Burger is the unhealthiest fast food in the world, so he decides that his namesake restaurant should serve the \"Mother Nature Burger\" which is entirely vegetarian. All of the townsfolks like the new burgers, but soon the entire town has food poisoning, traced to tainted barley caused by a rat that got caught in the grinder which was grown in the neighboring town of Ogdenville. The ensuing boycott destroys the local barley industry and the residents of Ogdenville, who are descended from Norwegian settlers and portrayed as overly stereotypical, are forced to abandon their town (to Norwegian romantic composer Edvard Grieg's mournful \"Aase's Death\", followed by a phrase from the Finlandia Hymn by his Finnish counterpart Jean Sibelius).",

    "Floyd Alburn Firestone (1898–1986) was an acoustical physicist, who in 1940 while a professor at the University of Michigan invented the first practical ultrasonic testing method and apparatus. He was granted US Patent 2,280,226 for the invention in 1942. Manufactured by Sperry Corporation, the testing device was known variously as the Firestone-Sperry Reflectoscope, the Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope, the Sperry Reflectoscope and sometimes also just as a Supersonic Reflectoscope, the name Firestone had originally coined for the instrument. The technology is not just used in quality control in factories to reject defective parts before shipment, but also revolutionized transportation safety. For example, ultrasonic testing is used for safety maintenance inspection of railroad cars, particularly axles and wheels, aircraft, particularly fuselages, and other transportation vessels for material fatigue. Dr. Firestone’s ultrasonic pulse echo technique for metal defect testing was also later applied in medical diagnosis, giving birth to the field of Echocardiography and to the field of Medical Ultrasonography, generally. Dr. Firestone was the editor of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America from 1939-1957. Among Firestone’s many other inventions in his field are in a single year an “automatic device for the minute inspection of flaws”, “a new and useful improvement in hook-up of electrical apparatus”, and “[a] device for measuring noise”, and, even, later a “musical typewriter”. In 1933, Firestone proposed an alternative to the mechanical–electrical analogy of James Clerk Maxwell in which force is made the analogy of voltage (the impedance analogy).  Firestone's analogy (now called the mobility analogy) makes force the analogy of current.  In this work he introduced the concept of \"through\" and \"across\" variables and demonstrated that there were analogies for these variables in other energy domains, making it possible to treat a complex system as a unified whole in analysis.  Firestone's analogy became popular amongst mechanical filter designers because it has the property of preserving network topologies when transforming between the mechanical and electrical domains.",

    "Inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate 3-kinase , abbreviated here as ITP3K, is an enzyme that facilitates a phospho-group transfer from adenosine triphosphate to 1D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:1D-myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphotransferase. ITP3K catalyzes the transfer of the gamma-phosphate from ATP to the 3-position of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to form inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. ITP3K is highly specific for the 1,4,5-isomer of IP3, and it exclusively phosphorylates the 3-OH position, producing Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, also known as inositol tetrakisphosphate or IP4. In biology, the enzyme ITP3K is abbreviated a number of different ways, including 1D-myo-inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase, ITP3K, ITPK, IP3-kinase, IP3-3-kinase, Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase.  In addition the enzyme may be named as the product of one of 3 genes in humans ITPKA, ITPKB, and ITPKC, or one of two in fruit flies, IP3K1 and IP3K2—a mutant known to geneticists as wavy. The nematode genome has one form of the enzyme, coded by the  LFE-2 gene. ITP3K enzymes are expressed only in metazoans; they are not expressed in yeast or plants.",
    "Norwood Russell Hanson (August 17, 1924 – April 18, 1967) was an American philosopher of science. Hanson was a pioneer in advancing the argument that observation is theory-laden — that observation language and theory language are deeply interwoven — and that historical and contemporary comprehension are similarly deeply interwoven. His single most central intellectual concern was the comprehension and development of a logic of discovery. Work\nHanson's best-known work is Patterns of Discovery (1958), in which he argues that what we see and perceive is not what our senses receive, but is instead filtered sensory information, where the filter is our existing preconceptions – a concept later called a 'thematic framework.' He cited optical illusions such as the famous old Parisienne woman (Patterns of Discovery, p. 11), which can be seen in different ways. Hanson drew a distinction between 'seeing as' and 'seeing that' which became a key idea in evolving theories of perception and meaning. He wanted to formulate a logic explaining how scientific discoveries take place. He used Charles Sanders Peirce's notion of abduction for this.",
    "Burkhard Heim (; 9 February 1925 – 14 January 2001) was a German theoretical physicist. He devoted a large portion of his life to the pursuit of his unified field theory, Heim theory.

However, a previous essay about explosives led to his working briefly in a chemical laboratory as an explosives technician, instead. An explosion in the laboratory caused by the mishandling of unstable compounds left him with debilitating handicaps.

    "Mitzvah Day International is an annual day of faith-based social action that takes place in November each year, primarily in the United Kingdom. On Mitzvah Day each year, community groups and individuals undertake a range of volunteer projects for those in need in their local community. Organizations register with Mitzvah Day, which in turn helps match volunteers with local projects. The objective is to encourage people to give their time, rather than their money, to worthwhile local causes, whilst also creating deeper linkages within communities and supporting charities. In 2013, close to 30,000 people participated in Mitzvah Day around the world.\nThough based within the UK's Jewish Community, Mitzvah Day traditionally marks the first day of UK National Inter Faith Week, and as a result has expanded to include participants from other faith communities as well.\n'Mitzvah' is the Hebrew biblical term for 'deed' or 'commandment', which has come to mean 'good deed' or 'charitable act' in contemporary English.

    "The Hamburg Rules are a set of rules governing the international shipment of goods, resulting from the United Nations International Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea adopted in Hamburg on 31 March 1978. The Convention was an attempt to form a uniform legal base for the transportation of goods on oceangoing ships. A driving force behind the convention was the attempt by developing countries' to provide all participants a fair and equal chance of succeeding. It came into force on 1 November 1992. History\nThe first of the international conventions on the carriage of goods by sea was the Hague Rules of 1924.   In 1968, the Hague Rules  were updated to become the Hague-Visby Rules, but the changes were modest. The convention still covered only \"tackle to tackle\" carriage contracts, with no provision for multimodal transport. The industry-changing phenomenon of containerization was barely acknowledged.  The 1978 Hamburg Rules were introduced to provide a framework that was both more modern, and less biased in favour of ship-operators.  Although the Hamburg Rules were readily adopted by developing countries, they were shunned by richer countries who stuck with Hague and  Hague-Visby. It had been expected that a Hague/Hamburg compromise might arise, but instead the more extensive Rotterdam Rules appeared.",

    "London weighting is an allowance paid to certain civil servants, teachers, airline employees, PhD students, police and security officers in and around London, the capital of the United Kingdom. It is designed to help these workers with the cost of living in Greater London, which is higher than that of the rest of the UK. Its purpose is to encourage key workers to stay in Greater London. London weighting was introduced for civil servants in 1920 and was set by the London Pay Board. However, since 1974, the Greater London Council, and later the Mayor of London, in partnership with central government, have been responsible for setting it. In 2002, teachers from across South East England went on strike to try to force London weighting to be raised. In many professions, such as teaching, a different level of weighting is applied to Inner London and Outer London. In addition, many employers use different pay grades for Greater London as opposed to a fixed allowance, and some groups  the police, for example  have both a London weighting and a London allowance.",

    "\"Re-Make/Re-Model\" is a song written by Bryan Ferry that appears as the opening track on Roxy Music's eponymous debut album.  The recording starts with some brief background ambiance of a cocktail party, before launching into the song. Whilst the basic backing track of guitar, acoustic piano, bass guitar, tenor saxophone and drums is relatively straightforward and traditional in form, other elements of the arrangement are quite bizarre and futuristic: Eno plays continual squalls of atonal oscillator noise using Andy MacKay's VCS3 synthesizer, whilst Ferry's lead vocal style is strikingly distraught and anguished in tone. The lead guitar and saxophone solos in the middle of the song also tend to cacophony. In the song, each instrument is allowed a short solo break in turn; the sax mimics the trumpets from Richard Wagner's opera \"the Valkyrie\" and the bass guitar solo mimics the riff from the Beatles song \"Day Tripper\". Phil Manzanera's guitar part reverses the usual guitar pattern: he plays single-note lead guitar all through the song, with no chords, but his solo break consists only of chords.",
    "Contemporary architecture is the architecture of the 21st century.  No single style is dominant.  Contemporary architects work in several different styles, from postmodernism, high-tech architecture and new interpretations of traditional architecture to highly conceptual forms and designs, resembling sculpture on an enormous scale. Some of these styles and approaches make use of very advanced technology and modern building materials, such as tube structures which allow construction of buildings that are taller, lighter and stronger than those in the 20th century, while others prioritize the use of natural and ecological materials like stone, wood and lime. One technology that is common to all forms of contemporary architecture is the use of new techniques of computer-aided design, which allow buildings to be designed and modeled on computers in three dimensions, and constructed with more precision and speed. Contemporary buildings and styles vary greatly. Some feature concrete structures wrapped in glass or aluminium screens, very asymmetric facades, and cantilevered sections which hang over the street. Skyscrapers twist, or break into crystal-like facets. Facades are designed to shimmer or change color at different times of day.",

    "A Head-on engagement is one where a surface-to-air missile system or jet aircraft engages another aircraft while the target aircraft is flying towards the attacker. This makes engagement with infrared homing missiles more difficult because the hot engine exhaust nozzle(s) of the target are pointing away from the attacker. Typically only all-aspect infra-red homing missiles are able to perform head-on engagements. Radar-guided missiles are typically able, however head-on many aircraft have a much smaller radar cross-section so the radar may not be able to track/lock onto the target at maximum range in this type of engagement. Missiles typically have a lower chance of hitting a target in a head-on engagement because of the very fast closure rate. If the missile is travelling at Mach 2.5 and the aircraft at Mach 1, the combined rate of Mach 3.5 doesn't give the missile very much time to respond to violent evasive maneuvers the aircraft might perform or to recover from being fooled by countermeasures, etc. In addition, the aircraft can turn away from the missile and then toward it again just before impact, forcing the missile to turn in a much tighter circle than the aircraft needs to in order to follow it through this maneuver. Although missiles can turn faster than aircraft, this advantage is often enough to cause the missile to fly past the aircraft without coming within lethal range.",
    "Virgo is the eponymous debut studio album by American house music duo Virgo Four, released in 1989 on Radical Records in the United Kingdom. It compiles two 12\" EPs released in the United States on Trax Records, Do You Know Who You Are? by Virgo Four and Ride by M.E.. Both were pseudonyms of Eric Lewis and Merwyn Sanders, two art students and childhood friends from Chicago. The album was first reissued in 2010 on Rush Hour Recordings. While rooted in the Chicago house style, Virgo features a distinctive sound that is dreamier and more introspective than that of the duo's contemporaries, also incorporating elements of acid house and deep house. Although Lewis and Sanders made no effort to promote the album, its idiosyncratic music and the mystery surrounding the band's identity turned it into an underground cult classic over the years. Although it remains largely unknown, Virgo is now recognized as an essential release among house enthusiasts, and is considered by some as the greatest album of its genre.",

According to tradition, it was translated from Sanskrit into Chinese by Dharmajātayaśas, an Indian monk, in 481, however Buswell, Dolce and Muller describe it as an apocryphal Chinese text. It is part of the Threefold Lotus Sutra, along with the Lotus Sutra and the Samantabhadra Meditation Sutra. As such, many Mahayana Buddhists consider it the prologue to the Lotus Sutra, and Chapter one of the Lotus Sutra states that the Buddha taught the Infinite Meanings just before expounding the Lotus Sutra. Title\nFor Buddhists, the term \"Innumerable Meanings\" or \"Infinite Meanings\" is used in two senses. The first, used in the singular, refers to the true aspect of all things, the true nature of all forms in the universe.  The second sense, used in the plural, refers to the countless appearances or phenomena of the physical, visible world.  All of these countless appearances are brought forth by the one true, pure world – the true aspect of all things (the one true Dharma of \"nonform\").",

    "Anti-discrimination law or non-discrimination law refers to legislation designed to prevent discrimination against particular groups of people; these groups are often referred to as protected groups or protected classes. Anti-discrimination laws vary by jurisdiction with regard to the types of discrimination that are prohibited, and also the groups that are protected by that legislation. Commonly, these types of legislation are designed to prevent discrimination in employment, housing, education, and other areas of social life, such as public accommodations. Anti-discrimination law may include protections for groups based on sex, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, mental illness or ability, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity/expression, sex characteristics, religion, creed, or individual political opinions. Anti-discrimination laws are rooted in principles of equality, specifically, that individuals should not be treated differently due to the characteristics outlined above. At the same time, they have often been criticised as violations of the inherent right of free association. Anti-discrimination laws are designed to protect against both individual discrimination (committed by individuals) and from structural discrimination (arising from policies or procedures that disadvantage certain groups). Courts may take into account both discriminatory intent and disparate impact in determining whether a particular action or policy constitutes discrimination.",

    "The Battle of Jutland (, the Battle of Skagerrak) was a naval battle fought between Britain's Royal Navy Grand Fleet, under Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, and the Imperial German Navy's High Seas Fleet, under Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, during the First World War. The battle unfolded in extensive manoeuvring and three main engagements (the battlecruiser action, the fleet action and the night action), from 31 May to 1 June 1916, off the North Sea coast of Denmark's Jutland Peninsula. It was the largest naval battle and the only full-scale clash of battleships in that war.  Jutland was the third fleet action between steel battleships, following the Battle of the Yellow Sea in 1904 and the decisive Battle of Tsushima in 1905, during the Russo-Japanese War.  Jutland was the last major battle in world history fought primarily by battleships. In terms of total ships displaced, it was the largest surface naval battle in history. Germany's High Seas Fleet intended to lure out, trap, and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, as the German naval force was insufficient to openly engage the entire British fleet. This formed part of a larger strategy to break the British blockade of Germany and to allow German naval vessels access to the Atlantic.

    "Design for logistics is a series of concepts in the field of supply chain management involving product and design approaches that help to control logistics costs and increase customer service level. These concepts were introduced by Professor Hau Lee of Stanford University, and have the three key components: Economic packaging and transportation, Concurrent and parallel processing, and Standardization. Economic packaging and transportation\nThere are three levels, moving from operational, to tactical and finally strategic.\n Common sense: Product and packaging must be designed so it is easy to ship and shelf (for instance, Rubbermaid design that fits Walmart's 14x14 shelving). Making a product much stronger and more rugged than necessary for its normal function typically increases parts cost, but sometimes it lowers the net cost by reducing the cost of padding and protection for shipping.\n Facilitate logistic function: Must be easy to pack and repack, and easy to track.\n Enables efficient design of supply chain and business model: For instance, IKEA's supply chain and business model (flat packages etc.)",

    "Romantic racism is a form of racism in which members of a dominant group project their fantasies onto members of oppressed groups. Feminist scholars have accused Norman Mailer, Jack Kerouac, and other Beatnik authors of the 1950s of romantic racism. They maintain that the dominant mainstream culture of the 1950s in the United States stressed conformity and held up middle-class suburban families as the cultural ideal, and that it was indifferent to art and literature, upheld racial segregation, and despised or ignored black achievements, such as jazz. Those, like the novelist Norman Mailer, who felt limited by or alienated from mainstream culture, sought out influences from other cultures as a form of rebellion. Mailer, a great fan of jazz music, created his concept of what it meant to be \"hip\", or a member of the white urban counterculture, largely on his perception of the culture of urban African-Americans (with whom the expression \"hip\", meaning \"in the know\", originated) and articulated his vision in his essay \"The White Negro\".

    "In computing, VISC (Virtual Instruction Set Computing) architecture is a processor instruction set architecture and microarchitecture developed by Soft Machines, which uses the Virtual Software Layer (translation layer) to dispatch a single thread of instructions to the Global Front End which splits instructions into virtual hardware threadlets which are then dispatched to separate virtual cores. These virtual cores can then send them to the available resources on any of the physical cores. Multiple virtual cores can push threadlets into the reorder buffer of a single physical core, which can split partial instructions and data from multiple threadlets through the execution ports at the same time. Each virtual core keeps track of the position of the relative output. This form of multithreading can increase single threaded performance by allowing a single thread to use all resources of the CPU.\nThe allocation of resources is dynamic on a near-single cycle latency level (1–4 cycles depending on the change in allocation depending on individual application needs. Therefore, if two virtual cores are competing for resources, there are appropriate algorithms in place to determine what resources are to be allocated where. Unlike the traditional processor designs, VISC doesn't use physical cores, instead the resources of the chip are made available as 'virtual cores' and 'virtual hardware threads' according to workload needs.",

    "Ship breaking is the process of dismantling old, decommissioned ships for recycling or disposal. It is a complex and hazardous industry that involves the breaking down of large vessels into smaller parts, which can then be sold as scrap metal or used for other purposes.\n\nThe practice of ship breaking has been around for centuries, but it gained significant attention in the 20th century as the global shipping industry expanded and more ships reached the end of their operational lives. Ship breaking yards are typically located in developing countries, where labor costs are low and environmental regulations may be less stringent.\n\nThe process of ship breaking begins with the arrival of a ship at the yard. The ship is first inspected to determine its condition and the best method for dismantling. Hazardous materials such as asbestos, lead, and oil are removed and disposed of properly to minimize environmental and health risks.\n\nOnce the hazardous materials have been removed, the ship is then cut into smaller sections using heavy machinery such as cranes, shears, and torches. These sections are then further broken down into smaller pieces, which are sorted and prepared for recycling. The metal is typically melted down and sold as scrap, while other materials such as wood, glass, and plastic are recycled or disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner.\n\nShip breaking is a dangerous and labor-intensive process that poses significant risks to workers. The dismantling of large ships requires skilled workers who are trained in handling heavy machinery and working in hazardous conditions. Accidents and injuries are not uncommon in ship breaking yards, and there have been instances of fatalities due to unsafe working conditions.\n\nIn recent years, there has been growing concern over the environmental and human rights implications of ship breaking. The improper disposal of hazardous materials can lead to pollution of the surrounding land and water, posing risks to both the environment and the health of local communities. Additionally, there have been reports of poor working conditions, low wages, and exploitation of workers in ship breaking yards.\n\nTo address these concerns, international organizations such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the Basel Convention have developed guidelines and regulations for the safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships. These guidelines aim to ensure that ship breaking is carried out in a responsible manner, with proper consideration for worker safety and environmental protection.\n\nDespite the challenges and risks associated with ship breaking, the industry continues to play a significant role in the global economy. The demand for scrap metal and other recycled materials remains high, and ship breaking provides an important source of employment and economic activity in many developing countries.\n\nIn conclusion, ship breaking is a complex and",

    "Anti-discrimination law refers to a set of legal measures and regulations that aim to prevent and prohibit discrimination based on certain protected characteristics. These laws are designed to ensure equal treatment and opportunities for individuals, regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or other protected characteristics.\n\nThe concept of anti-discrimination law has its roots in the civil rights movement of the 1960s, which sought to address the systemic discrimination and inequality faced by marginalized groups in society. The passage of landmark legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the United States and the Equality Act 2010 in the United Kingdom marked significant milestones in the development of anti-discrimination law.\n\nAnti-discrimination laws typically cover various areas of public life, including employment, housing, education, public accommodations, and access to goods and services. These laws prohibit discriminatory practices such as unequal pay, harassment, segregation, denial of services, and other forms of unfair treatment based on protected characteristics.\n\nOne of the key principles underlying anti-discrimination law is the concept of equal opportunity. These laws aim to create a level playing field for all individuals, ensuring that they have the same chances and access to resources, regardless of their background or characteristics. By promoting equality and diversity, anti-discrimination laws contribute to the overall well-being and social cohesion of a society.\n\nEnforcement of anti-discrimination laws is typically carried out by government agencies, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the United States or the Equality and Human Rights Commission in the United Kingdom. These agencies investigate complaints of discrimination, mediate disputes, and may take legal action against violators of anti-discrimination laws.\n\nWhile anti-discrimination laws have made significant progress in promoting equality and protecting individuals from discrimination, challenges and debates surrounding these laws continue to exist. Some argue that anti-discrimination laws infringe on individual freedoms and property rights, while others believe that these laws do not go far enough in addressing systemic discrimination and inequality.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing recognition of the need to expand anti-discrimination laws to include additional protected characteristics, such as sexual orientation, gender identity, and genetic information. This reflects a growing understanding of the intersectionality of discrimination and the need to address multiple forms of discrimination faced by individuals.\n\nOverall, anti-discrimination laws play a crucial role in promoting equality, protecting individuals from discrimination, and fostering inclusive societies. These laws continue to evolve and adapt to the changing social and legal landscape, as societies strive to create a more just and equitable world for all.",

    "Time travel is a concept that has fascinated humanity for centuries. It refers to the ability to travel either backward or forward in time, manipulating the flow of time to visit moments in history or in the future. Although time travel is a popular theme in science fiction, its plausibility in the real world is still a subject of debate among scientists and philosophers.\n\nThe concept of time travel can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where stories and myths often mentioned individuals who had the ability to move through time. However, it wasn't until the development of modern science fiction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that time travel became a popular topic in literature and media.\n\nOne of the earliest and most notable depictions of time travel in literature is H.G. Wells' novel, \"The Time Machine,\" published in 1895. This visionary work introduced the idea of a machine that could transport individuals through time, allowing them to witness the future firsthand. Wells' novel sparked the imagination of readers and opened the floodgates for countless stories and movies featuring time travel.\n\nIn the field of physics, the concept of time travel is extensively explored through various theoretical frameworks. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, proposed in the early 20th century, laid the foundation for understanding the relationship between time, space, and gravity. It suggested that time is not an absolute quantity but rather a flexible dimension that can be affected by speed and gravity.\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory, time slows down for objects that are moving at high speeds relative to an observer or in the presence of strong gravitational fields. This phenomenon, known as time dilation, has been observed and measured in experiments with high-speed particles and by comparing the time experienced by astronauts orbiting the Earth with that of people on the planet's surface.\n\nDespite these fascinating findings, mastering the art of time travel remains beyond the reach of current scientific understanding. The main obstacle is the violation of causality, a fundamental principle that states that an effect cannot precede its cause. Going back in time and changing the past could lead to paradoxes, such as the \"grandfather paradox,\" where a time traveler prevents their own existence by killing their grandfather before their parent was born.\n\nVarious theories have been proposed to reconcile the paradoxes associated with time travel. One of them is the \"Novikov self-consistency principle,\" which suggests that the timeline is self-correcting and any actions taken by time travelers would result in the outcome they sought to change, preserving the original timeline. Other theories, such as the",

The engine produced an impressive 2,200 horsepower, giving the Ki-87 a top speed of over 700 kilometers per hour.\n\nTo further enhance its performance, the Ki-87 featured a streamlined fuselage and retractable landing gear. The aircraft also had a large wing area, which provided excellent maneuverability and stability. The armament of the Ki-87 consisted of two 30mm cannons and two 20mm cannons, which were mounted in the wings.\n\nThe first prototype of the Ki-87 made its maiden flight in 1944. Initial test flights revealed that the aircraft had exceptional performance, with excellent climb rate and maneuverability. However, the Ki-87 suffered from several issues, including engine overheating and poor visibility from the cockpit.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Ki-87 showed great promise and was considered a significant improvement over existing Japanese fighter aircraft. However, due to the worsening war situation and limited resources, the project was eventually canceled in 1945. Only two prototypes of the Ki-87 were ever built, and neither saw combat.\n\nToday, the Nakajima Ki-87 is remembered as an impressive example of Japanese engineering during World War II. Its advanced features and high-performance capabilities make it a fascinating piece of aviation history. Although it never entered mass production or saw combat, the Ki-87 remains a testament to the ingenuity and ambition of the Japanese aircraft industry during the war.",

    "Evolutionary biology is a scientific discipline that studies the processes and patterns of biological evolution. It seeks to understand how organisms have evolved and diversified over time, and how they are related to one another through common ancestry. This field of study encompasses a wide range of topics, including the origin of life, the mechanisms of genetic variation, the processes of natural selection, and the formation of new species.\n\nThe study of evolutionary biology is rooted in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, which he first proposed in his seminal work \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859. Darwin's theory revolutionized our understanding of the natural world by providing a mechanism for how species change over time and adapt to their environments. It proposed that individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to future generations. This process, known as natural selection, is the driving force behind the diversity of life on Earth.\n\nEvolutionary biology draws on a wide range of scientific disciplines, including genetics, paleontology, ecology, and molecular biology. By combining evidence from these fields, researchers can reconstruct the evolutionary history of organisms and understand the processes that have shaped their characteristics. For example, the study of fossils allows scientists to trace the evolution of species over millions of years, while genetic analysis can reveal the relationships between different organisms and the genetic changes that have occurred over time.\n\nOne of the key concepts in evolutionary biology is the idea of common ancestry. According to this principle, all living organisms share a common ancestor that lived billions of years ago. This means that humans, plants, and even bacteria are all part of the same tree of life. By studying the similarities and differences between different species, scientists can infer the relationships between them and reconstruct the evolutionary tree of life.\n\nEvolutionary biology has important implications for a wide range of fields, including medicine, agriculture, and conservation. By understanding the processes of evolution, scientists can develop new treatments for diseases, breed crops with improved traits, and design strategies for conserving endangered species. Evolutionary biology also provides insights into the origins of human traits and behaviors, shedding light on our own evolutionary history.\n\nIn recent years, advances in technology have revolutionized the field of evolutionary biology. DNA sequencing techniques have allowed scientists to study the genetic makeup of organisms in unprecedented detail, revealing the genetic changes that have occurred during evolution. Computational methods have also been developed to analyze large datasets and reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between species. These technological advancements have opened up new avenues of research and expanded our understanding of the processes of evolution.\n\n",

    "Judicial murder, also known as legal execution or state-sanctioned killing, refers to the act of putting an individual to death as a punishment for a crime, following a legal process. This form of punishment has been practiced throughout history and across different cultures, often as a means of deterring crime and maintaining social order.\n\nThe concept of judicial murder dates back to ancient civilizations, where rulers and governing bodies held the power to decide the fate of individuals accused of crimes. In many cases, these executions were carried out publicly, serving as a spectacle to instill fear and discourage others from engaging in similar behavior.\n\nThroughout the centuries, the methods of judicial murder have evolved, ranging from public hangings and beheadings to more modern forms such as lethal injection and electrocution. The justification for these executions has varied, with proponents arguing that they serve as a deterrent and a form of retribution for heinous crimes.\n\nHowever, the practice of judicial murder has been widely criticized on ethical, moral, and human rights grounds. Opponents argue that it violates the right to life, as enshrined in various international human rights treaties and declarations. They also contend that the death penalty is inherently flawed, as it is irreversible and can lead to the execution of innocent individuals.\n\nFurthermore, concerns have been raised about the potential for bias and discrimination in the application of the death penalty. Studies have shown that factors such as race, socioeconomic status, and the quality of legal representation can influence the likelihood of receiving a death sentence. This has led to calls for the abolition of judicial murder, with many countries and jurisdictions around the world moving towards the elimination of capital punishment.\n\nThe debate surrounding judicial murder has also focused on its effectiveness as a deterrent. While proponents argue that the threat of execution can deter potential criminals, opponents point to studies that suggest the death penalty has little to no impact on crime rates. They argue that more effective alternatives, such as life imprisonment without parole, can achieve the same goals without resorting to state-sanctioned killing.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a global trend towards the abolition of the death penalty. As of 2021, over two-thirds of countries have abolished the practice in law or in practice. International organizations, such as Amnesty International and the United Nations, have been instrumental in advocating for the abolition of judicial murder and promoting human rights standards.\n\nDespite this progress, some countries continue to carry out executions, often in cases involving serious crimes such as murder, terrorism, or drug trafficking. The ongoing debate surrounding judicial murder reflects the complex and",

    " Head-on engagement is a military tactic where two military forces, often of unequal size, advance towards each other along a single axis of advance. The intention of the weaker party is to allow the enemy forces to come close enough to engage in direct fire, or to allow friendly artillery to fire upon the enemy forces when the ranges are very short, thereby achieving an advantageous concentration of fire against the usually-weaker enemy forces. Generally, this tactic is used as a last resort when the attacking force has no other obvious advantage, as it is a high-risk maneuver that can result in severe casualties against the attacking force. It may be used as a means of assault, or as a defensive measure. History has shown that head-on engagements are usually not decisive, and that they are more likely to result in a draw than in a victory for either side.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, infantry regiments engaged in head-on engagements, with both sides sometimes lining up in parallel ranks. This was a product of the linear tactics employed at the time, which were derived from the Napoleonic Wars. The armies would approach each other and fire at effective ranges, often with both sides taking cover behind natural features of the landscape, such as hills and ridges. When the armies were close enough, they would charge each other with bayonets fixed.\n\nIn the First World War, head-on engagements between infantry and artillery were rare, as the weapons and tactics used were more effective at long ranges. However, there were several instances of head-on engagements between tanks and infantry, as both weapons were effective at short ranges.\n\nIn the Second World War, head-on engagements were more common, as the weapons and tactics used were more effective at medium ranges. For example, the German army would often use surprise and speed to attack Allied forces from the front, while Allied forces would use long-range artillery and air power to attack German forces from a distance.\n\nIn the Vietnam War, head-on engagements between US forces and Viet Cong guerrillas were common, as the Viet Cong would often use hit-and-run tactics and ambush US forces from a distance. US forces would often use artillery and air power to attack Viet Cong forces, but would also engage in direct combat with the Viet Cong when necessary.",

    " Pre-2004 Telangana protests\nThe Telangana rebellion, popularly known as the Telangana agitation, was a movement for democracy and separate statehood, led by the Telugu people of the Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh, South India from 1946 to 1951. It began as a peasant revolt against the princely state of Hyderabad, ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad, and later, a popular movement against the rule of India. The conflict began when the Nizam vowed to oppose the merger of Hyderabad state with the Indian Union and premiered an \"Agrarian Law\" in an attempt to safeguard the interests of the landlords. This resulted in protests from the peasants, followed by outbreaks of violence all over Telangana. The agitation ended in a stalemate, with the withdrawal of the peasants and the enactment of the Police Act of 1905 by the Hyderabad government to curb the violence.\n\nRevival of the Telangana movement\nThe Telangana movement emerged from a meeting called by the Andhra Mahasabha in 1947 at Erragadda, near Hyderabad, with the aim of safeguarding the interests of the Telanganites. At the meeting, Madapati Rao, the former Education Minister of the seven-year Hyderabad state Congress government, declared that an agitation would be launched to compel the new government of Andhra Pradesh to enact policies that would be beneficial to the people of Telangana. A 16-member committee was appointed to organize the agitation. The committee members held meetings at Kalvakurthy, Nalgonda, and Aler. The movement was launched on 28 July 1947, when Raja Unreleased passed a resolution in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly, calling for the dismissal of the Hyderabadi cabinet and the reconstruction of a new ministry by allocating proportional representation to Telangana.\n\nIn November 1947, the Indian government took over the administration of Hyderabad in a military operation known as \"Operation Polo\". The Hyderabad state was merged with the Indian Union, and M. Chenna Reddy became the first chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. However, the agitation continued with the same demands. In 1948, a delegation of the Andhra Mahasabha met with the new chief minister, and asked for the removal of the Hyderabad ministers from the Andhra cabinet and the formation of a regional board for the development of Telangana. The delegation also demanded that Telugu should be made the official language of the state and that the Telugu-speaking area of Hyderabad state, known as Marathwada, should be merged with Andhra Pradesh. The demands were not met, leading the Andhra Mahasabha to launch an agitation in Telangana. The",

He is considered to be an exemplification of masculinity and is widely referred to as Malhari Martand, the warrior god.\n\nHistory\nScholars disagree on his origins and the chronology of his life. Some, like P. L. Vaidya, propose that he is a local form of Shiva, and others, like PM Bakshi and PM Goswamy, believe that he shares characteristics with both Shiva and Kartikeya. Some scholars also believe that he is a form of Narasimha. Other scholars believe that he is a folk hero who became deified.\n\nOne of the several legends associated with him takes place in the Kudalasangama temple, where the celestial deities invoked a boy from the infinite who grew up as Khandoba. At the end of his childhood, he is sent to kill the asura (demon) Mahishasura, who had been terrorizing the gods and gods beings. Having killed the asura on the mountain Vari, Khandoba proceeded to the Mahishasura's palace, called Malwa or Malwar. Because of this, he is also known as Malhari.\n\nAnother popular legend associated with Khandoba tells the story of Mhalsa, the daughter of Matangi, the goddess of music. Mhalsa was a great dancer, but she was attacked by a demon, who was defeated by Shiva and turned into an eggplant. Mhalsa was saved by Shiva and transformed into a piece of flesh. Shiva then ordered her to be reborn as the daughter of Gandharvasena, the king of the gods. Mhalsa was born on the same day as Shiva's marriage to Parvati, and she participated in the wedding as a friend of Parvati. After the wedding, Mhalsa requested Parvati to allow her to serve Khandoba. Parvati agreed, and Mhalsa served Khandoba as his devotee.\n\nAnother story tells that Khandoba was born as their son to a couple in the village of Korbal in the Wardha district. His parents named him Martand, and he studied the Vedas and other sacred books from a young age. When he grew up, he traveled to the Himalayas to practice meditation and yoga. He received the blessings of Shiva and became his devotee.\n\nKhandoba is worshiped by the Dh",

    " Dictogloss is a language-learning strategy designed to develop both fluency and accuracy in learners' use of a target language. In this strategy, a group of learners collaboratively reconstruct a spoken text, beginning with only oral and contextual cues. In the original implementation of this strategy, the speaker of the target language narrates a story, addressing the audience in the plural \"you,\" which implies that the narrative is intended for a group of listeners. The listeners write the story as the speaker relates it, without consulting one another and without revising their individual scripts until the speaker has finished telling the story. Then, the groups compare their versions and reconstruct a collective text. Next, the participants who have spoken the target language retell the story in their own words, again addressing the audience in the plural \"you.\" The other participants then compare this retelling with the collective text and evaluate it for accuracy in relation to the collective text and for fluency.\n\nThe strategy was developed by Jamie Keddie, a teacher at the British Council in Barcelona, Spain, in the late 1980s. It was further developed and extended by a number of other teachers in the 1990s. The activity is designed for use with adults and young adults, and it is particularly useful for developing a student's ability to use the past tense and the conditional tense in the target language. It can also be used to develop other aspects of language use, such as vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.",

There is no universal method for determining a customer's suitability for a given investment.\n\nSome advisors are held to a fiduciary standard, which requires them to make investment recommendations that are consistent with their client's financial goals and are always in their client's best interest. Others are held to a suitability standard, which allows them to make recommendations that are suitable, but not necessarily ideal, for their clients. These distinctions are important because they affect the legal obligations and liabilities of the advisor.\n\nInvestment advisors often have a wide range of education and experience in the financial services industry, including training in investment analysis, portfolio management, and financial planning. They may also have certifications such as the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) or Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designations. These certifications require the advisor to pass a comprehensive exam and meet certain education and experience requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the services offered by investment advisors can vary widely, and it is important to do your research and choose an advisor who is reputable and has the appropriate qualifications and experience to meet your needs. It is also important to understand the fees associated with the services of an investment advisor, as these can vary widely as well.",

    " Marcus Herennius Faustus (October 31, 73 BC – April 5, 47 BC) was a Roman patriot, or possibly a Latin landowner, who joined the Optimate cause to uphold the Roman Republic.\n\nFaustus was born in Rome in 73 BC, the son of Marcus Herennius, a former consul and censor. His mother was Ocresia, the daughter of a wealthy man from Picenum. Faustus was the youngest of three children, with an older brother, Publius, and a sister,Marcia.\n\nFaustus' education was typical for the son of a noble Roman family. He would have learned literacy at a young age, as well as the basics of arithmetic, music, and public speaking. He would have been trained in the arts of riding, swimming, and hunting, and he would have learned the basics of military tactics. It is not known if Faustus attended a university.\n\nIn his youth, Faustus was a friend of Cato the Younger, and the two were known as the \"New Stoics\" for their strict adherence to Stoic philosophy. After Faustus' father died in 63 BC, he was elected to the office of quaestor, serving in Asia. He returned to Rome in 61 BC and was elected an augur the following year. In 59 BC, he supported his friend Cato in his election to the praetorship, and in 57 BC, he was elected praetor himself.\n\nFaustus was known for his strong opposition to Julius Caesar. In 49 BC, when Caesar crossed the Rubicon and began his march on Rome, Faustus was one of the first to take up arms against him. He was defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC and again at the Battle of Munda in 45 BC. After the second defeat, Faustus was taken prisoner by Caesar.\n\nCaesar initially planned to execute Faustus, but ultimately decided to spare his life. Instead, Faustus was exiled to Cumae, where he was kept under house arrest. He remained there until his death in 47 BC.\n\nFaustus is remembered as a Roman patriot who opposed Caesar's rise to power and fought for the preservation of the Roman Republic. However, some historians have argued that he was primarily a landowner who opposed Caesar's reforms because they threatened his own wealth and power.",

Dating from the 14th century, they are rectangular, often timber-framed buildings with a large hall and a smaller private room, or solar, on the first floor. Often the roof only covered the hall, with the solar being an open gallery. They were the home of wealthy farmers and merchants, and their size reflects this.\n\nWealden hall houses are characterised by:\n\ntheir rectangular plan, often with a projecting porch;\na great hall and a solar;\nthe great hall has an open hearth and windows to the front and rear walls;\na staircase leading up to the solar;\nthe roof is often thatched;\nthey are often built of timber framing with wattle and daub or loam fillings, though some are brick;\na partition, sometimes half-height, separating the hall from the service rooms;\na projecting upper floor, jetty, sometimes supported on brackets, and a gable end chimney stack.\n\nAs the Wealden area is rich in clay, many Wealden hall houses have brick walls, sometimes with a stone slate roof. In the 16th century, many Wealden hall houses were heightened, and their windows changed to conform to the new fashionable style of casement windows. Jetties were often added, and roofs were extended to cover the newly created first floor rooms. Chimney stacks were added, and in many cases the open hearths in the hall were removed.\n\nA Wealden hall house in Burwash, Sussex\nWealden hall houses are found in many parishes in the Weald. Almost every parish in the Rother and Hastings area has at least one example, and there are several in the neighbouring districts. They are often concealed behind later extensions and therefore not easily visible. Despite this, many survive remarkably unchanged, with the exception of the windows.\n\nIn regions further away from the Wealden area, such as the High Weald of Kent, or the area around Horsham, West Sussex, Wealden hall houses are less common, and are usually located on high ground, such as around Goudhurst, Kent, or Hartfield, East Sussex. In these areas they are usually built of timber framing with brick infill, and have tile roofs. They have narrower proportions than those in the sandstone areas, and often have gabled ends.\n\nWealden",

    " Robert Lee Hill (August 28, 1942 – November 26, 2007) was an American convicted murderer, who gained national attention after being convicted of killing a taxicab driver in Dallas, Texas, in 1976; he was sentenced to death. His case became noteworthy due to the questions about his mental competence raised by his brother, attorney John Hill, and the fact that he had been born with cerebral palsy and had a history of epilepsy.\n\nHill had previously been convicted of murder in 1968, for which he was sentenced to 75 years in prison. He was paroled from that sentence in 1972. The 1976 murder which led to his death sentence involved the killing of a taxicab driver, Samir Beg, who had been dispatched to pick up Hill at an address in Dallas. Beg was shot twice in the head by Hill after an apparent dispute over the fare. According to Hill, Beg had driven him to the wrong apartment complex. Beg's family and fellow cab drivers claimed that Beg never would have made such a mistake and alleged that the address provided by Hill was a fictitious one.\n\nHill was arrested shortly after the murder and gave a written statement to police in which he admitted to the killing. At his trial, he was found to be competent to stand trial and was convicted of murder, for which he was sentenced to death. His attorneys filed a motion for a new trial, alleging that Hill was not mentally competent to stand trial, which was denied. Hill's execution was initially scheduled for March 1977, but was delayed due to appeals and hearings on his mental competence. In 1979, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that Hill was not mentally competent to be executed and ordered that he be committed to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nIn 1986, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals again ruled that Hill was mentally competent to be executed. A lower court judge then set an execution date of December 7, 1987. Hill's attorneys filed a motion to block the execution on the grounds of racial discrimination, as Hill was a white man and most inmates executed in Texas at that time were African-American. The United States Supreme Court denied the motion, and Hill was executed by lethal injection on December 7, 1987.\n\nHill's execution received considerable attention from the media and from anti-death penalty activists, who claimed that Hill was mentally incompetent and that his conviction and execution were unjust. His case was cited as an example of the numerous flaws in the Texas capital punishment system by organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty International.",
    " See also: List of artist-run centres in Canada\nArtist-run centre is a term used to describe a class of contemporary art galleries that are artist-controlled and -directed commercial art galleries. Artist-run centres are usually artist-owned and -operated cooperatives, or nonprofit organizations, which emerged in the 1960s in Canada, and continue to be a very important part of the Canadian visual arts scene.\n\nWhile artist-run centres are commercial galleries, they are differentiated from commercial galleries by being artist-centred, rather than market-centred. They are usually focused on displaying and selling the work of artists who are members of the centre, rather than representing artists who are not members. They tend to be focused on artist-reception, rather than on commercial profit.\n\nThe first artist-run centre in Canada was Alternative Gallery of Contemporary Art, which was established in 1967 in Toronto by a group of graduates of the Ontario College of Art & Design. By the 1990s, there were over 130 artist-run centres in Canada.\n\nMany artist-run centres receive operational support from the Canada Council for the Arts or the provincial arts councils, or both. A number of artist-run centres are members of the Canadian Artists Representation (CARFAC).",

    "Brush ground is a condition of the football pitch common in association football. It is caused by the wearing of the pitch around the goal areas and is characterized by the soil being rubbed away and the presence of loose debris, making the surface hard and lumpy. This can lead to balls bouncing unnaturally and unpredictably when played in the affected areas.\n\nThe condition is particularly prominent on pitches that see frequent use, such as those of professional clubs, and those played on in winter months. The effect can be mitigated by frequent mowing and aeration of the pitch, and by ensuring that the soil is of a suitable condition and standard.\n\nIn some cases, brush ground can lead to the postponement of matches, particularly if the condition of the pitch affects the safety of the players.",

    "Marie U. Nylen (November 21, 1865 – August 24, 1947) was an American journalist and civic reformer. She was a pioneer in the movement for municipal ownership of public utilities. She is best known for her roles as the editor of the American Municipal Manual and as the author of the Nylen Ordinance, the first federal legislation on the topic. She was also a founding member of the National Association of Women Journalists. \nNylen was born in Bourbonnais, Illinois, to Frederick Bergen Nylen, a physician, and his second wife, Caroline ( Anderson) Nylen. She was the eldest of three children, with a half-brother 21 years her senior and a sister four years her younger. The family moved to Kankakee, Illinois, where she attended school. After her graduation from high school, she attended Illinois Normal University, where she studied shorthand, typing, and bookkeeping. It was during these years that she began to work for the Daily Journal (Kankakee), starting as a \"copy boy\" and advancing to reporter. In 1901 she moved to Chicago and began working for the Daily News (Chicago). \n\nIn 1904 she proposed a municipal ownership ordinance that would give cities the right to own public utilities. The ordinance passed the Illinois House of Representatives in 1905 and was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 1906. In 1909 President William Howard Taft signed it into law as the Nylen Ordinance. It was the first federal legislation on the topic and provided a model for subsequent state and federal laws. Nylen went on to advocate for municipal ownership of public utilities in other states as well. \n\nNylen served as the editor of the American Municipal Manual from 1911-1935. Under her leadership, the manual became a widely used resource for local governments and was expanded to include a comprehensive survey of every city in the United States. She also served as president of the International League of Municipal Ownership from 1915-1917. In 1913 she was a founding member of the National Association of Women Journalists. \n\nNylen was a prolific writer and speaker on the topics of municipal ownership and women's suffrage. She was a strong advocate for women's suffrage and served as president of the Illinois Women's Alliance. She also served on the boards of many organizations, including the Chicago Woman's Club, the Chicago Political Equality League, the Illinois Industrial University, and the Illinois Training School for Girls. She died in Chicago on August 24, 1947.",

In 1991, he made his name with one of the first keyboard games written in Russian, a computer game called QWERTY: QWERTTY or бантересок сибет.\n\nAt approximately the same time, Bekhterev began publishing the \"QWERTY\" keyboard guide, a series of instructions for new typists, written and released in Russian. The series was later made available in English.\n\nBekhterev had been interested in the keyboard since his early childhood, when, as a child, he had used an old IBM typewriter.

    "Alexander Menini (b. September 17 [2], ca. 1935) is an Italian political scientist, member of the French Collective for the Defense of Workers Rights (CDFRP). In September 1981, he was forced to resign after his statements defending the group's violent tactics were reported by Le Monde. Menini, born in Paris, worked as an economist at the Italian Commission of Economic Analysis during the Italian occupation of Algeria. He then became a professor of economics at Monza University. An active member of the CDP since its founding in 1960, he published articles on international economic history during the 1970s. Menini has denied political links to the CDP and the Front National (FN), and accused them and the mainstream press of \"scorched earth\" campaigns. In 1985, he founded the New Centre of the Left (Centre Centrale des Centres L`Istitutions), which published the journal Centrale Centrale during the 1990s. During his time in office, he adopted several neo-fascist policies. As minister of agriculture in 1990-91, he abolished the National Agricultural Assistance Fund, which gave support to smaller farmers through a fixed subsidy. The program was introduced in the early 1980s under the pretext of protecting rural communities. However, this subsidized support helped many very rich farmers. His policies in agriculture were criticized by many leading historians, including Piero Scafetta, but he was reelected to a second term by the European Parliament in February 1993. Menini was arrested and jailed in November 1995 on multiple charges of illegal wiretapping and extortion. He was released with time served and allowed to reapply as a parliamentary opponent in 2001. In the summer of 2004, the New Centre of the Left closed down. He left the Left Party, then formed by ex-FRG leader Umberto Bossi, which ended in September 2004. It seems that the new French Socialist Party and its leader, Edouard Philippe, are backing away from the man who claims to have defended \"the people\" against a \"dictatorship.\" Also, it seems that the Left is not trying to revive the legacy of the Front National. So there is nothing to see in all of this. And perhaps that's because there is nothing to see at all. But the situation that Menini describes is pretty much what is currently going on. I can only hope that there are people out",

    "\"The market access concept was first proposed in the 1980s to deal with the trade problems that arise from different economies having different national price levels for goods. Countries with low price levels have less capacity to gain the imports needed to meet their needs, but they also have relatively low barriers to trade (such as trade barriers). Countries with high price levels—including countries with large agricultural-based industries—have no trade barriers, but they may lack the trade capacity to gain from such imports.\"[1]\n\nThe paper cites John Hickson, \"The problem of 'trade-access' for the poor in a world of globalization\", American Institute of Professional People, 1982. It argues that trade policy, whether the policy is trade protection or free trade, must be seen in conjunction with market access to enable low income countries to make choices that best suit their needs.\n\nThe study, entitled \"Globalization: Making the best of it – The problems of poor countries – Market Access\", is written by Philip M. Tetlock, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, and Robert E. Eisner, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania. The paper is available on the website of both Philip E. Tetlock and Robert E. Eisner.\n\nAccording to the paper's abstract, \"These recommendations for action come from one of the first efforts to analyze the trade access problems that result from globalization. In this case, Tetlock and Eisner examine the problems of poorer parts of the world (like sub-Saharan Africa) and conclude that, notwithstanding the fact that many developing countries are trading partners, developing countries still face the problems of trade-access to the world's largest trading partners, most notably the United States. They make several recommendations in this area, and conclude that, if it can be foreseen, the world's poorest countries will be better off if the countries that dominate the global trading system are brought to the negotiating table sooner rather than later.\" [2] This is the best we can do for the world's poorest – they must become stronger.\n\nThese suggestions focus on policy measures, but there are more things that governments can do to help the poor of poor countries. Here are five ways they can do this.\n\nMake the poor into consumers. Let governments sell to the poor rather than selling to the rich. Let the prices of those goods come down to what the poor can afford. This may mean",

He made his Broadway debut as a child star playing Leopold Bloom's son in Richard Rodgers's production of David Garrick's The Little Foxes during New York City Ballet Theatre's Second World War run (1948). His stage performances then took him into Europe and the United States where he continued for years in some of the finest venues—including Central Park Opera House; the Metropolitan Opera House; the London Conservatoire; the San Diego Shakespeare Festival, among others--before returning to Britain in early 1957 to make his name in the film industry, first with Brian De Palma's thriller Stalag 17, then in his next blockbuster, Apollo 13. Following that, he continued directing over 30 motion pictures spanning multiple genres such as westerns, science fiction films, action-adventures, thrillers and comedies. During this period, Hepburn earned several awards including the Academy Medal for Best Actor at the 1960 Berlin International Film Festival. In 1964, he also coauthored A Journey Beyond with John Huston, an autobiographical volume with the help of legendary photographer Howard Rosenbaum\n\nand appeared in his own version of the movie \"A Bridge Too Far\"!

    "Enteropathy (also known as entheogenic medicine) is a term used to describe the practice of using herbs and other substances in place of conventional medical treatment for diseases, including cancer. It has been practiced by indigenous peoples throughout history, but it was not until the 19th century that it became popularized by physicians such as William Osler and Samuel Hahnemann. The term entered common usage during World War I when soldiers returning home with infections were prescribed antibiotics. In the 1920s, enteropaths began to use herbal remedies instead of traditional medicines, which led to widespread use of the term. Today, many practitioners believe that their practices are effective treatments for various conditions, including cancer, diabetes, asthma, allergies, arthritis, and depression.\n\nI have no idea what this means, but I'm sure you can figure out why it's important.\n\nSo, let's take a look at some of the claims made about Enteropathy.\n\n1. Enteropathy is a form of alternative medicine.\n\nThis claim is based on the fact that there are several different types of Enteropathic Medicine. There are Traditional Enteropathic Medicine (TEAM), Alternative Enteropathic Medicine (AEM), and Integrated Health Care (IHC). AEM is the most commonly used type of Enteropathy today.\n\n2. Enteropathy is a form of holistic health care.\n\nThere are many people who believe that Enteropathy is a form of holistic health care. This belief stems from the fact that many of the ingredients used in Enteropathy are natural and safe. However, there are also many things that are not natural or safe that are used in Enteropathy. For example, the following are all examples of things that are NOT natural or safe:\n\nAlcohol\n\nCaffeine\n\nChlorhexidine\n\nDietary supplements\n\nGlycerol\n\nHydrogen peroxide\n\nLactic acid\n\nMagnesium sulfate\n\nMethylene chloride\n\nNitrates\n\nPesticides\n\nSodium bicarbonate\n\nTetrahydrofuran\n\nVitamin C\n\n3.

    "One of Britain's leading universities, Manchester, has agreed to change its governance rules in order to attract large investments and new research grants - including the £250m investment by Google in the university's physics department. It joins other major research institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge University, Imperial College London and California-based Stanford University that have taken similar actions by limiting their roles for management or advisory boards, or cutting them completely, due to concern about corporate influence. The move is part of a growing trend among European universities to take action in response to increasingly negative press coverage over academic fees caused at least partly because of donations and investment by US companies. One source said that while UK universities were often cited specifically by public relations firms because they are seen as not offering enough conflict-free advice, \"the big companies we have dealt with [Google] are everywhere.\"... The changes come only two years after Sir John Sewel was named director general of a new industry fund, the Institute of Physics. In September 2011 he announced cuts in support from 10% to just 3%. He later resigned from his role in January 2012. While Sir John will continue on to become head of the fund, academics across the country began to express unease around his activities when information emerged relating to a lobbying trip he took to Washington to urge members of Congress and regulators to loosen regulations surrounding patents on ideas. It wasn't long before several high profile students left UEA for alternative colleges and some staff also joined others in leaving after becoming aware of Sir John's past dealings on behalf of companies with interests in materials science, computing, energy and nuclear power. Several weeks ago, a petition calling for all government funding given directly by UK taxpayers to scientific institutes be refused to Sir John Sewel was signed by around 600 people. Others voiced their concerns on social media using the hashtag #noesecurefunds.... Professor James Collins, of The Open University, who was one of hundreds of academics to sign the petition, told the Standard that it showed the situation had reached'such a crisis point' whereby it would no longer benefit UK institutions if they had their boards completely run by donors.... Professor Simon Singh of Stirling University told the Standard he understood why Google sought a board majority on issues concerning intellectual property. But he continued: \"This creates very serious ethical questions which should never arise under normal circumstances, yet the issue of corporate control has somehow",

    "Chlorosulfuretted prussian blue (Sulphate-reducing bacteria) Chloxonopsis limnanthes (CliB), more commonly known as Prasophylla lautatii, is a Gram positive bacterial bacterium that can be associated with water treatment problems and may also cause other undesirable aquatic microorganisms to appear in water samples at sites where it has been reported due to low iron levels in the municipal drinking water supply. The organism has been reported throughout China for several years. It grows on hard or organic material and exhibits a very strong growth inhibitory effect by its chemical defenses against biotransformation enzymes. In areas with increased fertilizer use and soil erosion due to irrigation, high acidity conditions, lower pH values than natural lake (or well water), poor biological activity and/or reduced light intensities and/or too much light damage, CliB produces chloroplast and subcultures (up to 60%) form which it rapidly matures to chloroplasts and dies after the end of its period of dormancy and growth inhibition (6). There are few reports related of this bacterium becoming malodorous but anecdotal data show this microbe to have antiseptic characteristics that are also characteristic of many Pseudomonas species and possibly some enteric pathogens among others which might explain why small amounts have produced considerable physiological changes under laboratory conditions. Since its isolation, it was introduced into various countries as a water quality control agent and the environmental environment and the health of people who consume it cannot be completely ruled out; therefore, caution needs to be exercised because of the possible adverse impact on public safety. This bacterium causes major problems when it forms persistent biofilms along walls and pipes caused mainly by its ability to produce hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide when exposed to water that contains oxygen. Moreover this bacterium also is likely to contribute to water quality loss due to reduction of dissolved oxygen concentration and subsequent development of hypobiosis and osmotic stress due to the metabolic metabolism of sulfide and methane, which would result of reducing the production of oxygen which would lead to physical and mental deficiencies if not treated with specific compounds such as ozone and carbon monoxide treatment. The organism is usually carried by fish, turtles, crustaceans and freshwater crustacea during their life cycle and survives on dead animal matter by forming new cell clusters containing it; furthermore, it persists",
    "In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on September 25, 2001, Prime Minister Tony Blair said that the war in Afghanistan was necessary because \"the Taliban are not our friends.\" He added that \"we have no choice but to act against them militarily if they refuse to come to the negotiating table and negotiate seriously with us.\" The prime minister's remarks were widely interpreted as a call for military action against the Taliban regime. However, he later clarified his position, saying that he had been referring only to the Taliban government in Kabul. In November 2002, the British Parliament voted by a large majority to support military action against the Taliban. On December 11, 2002, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1373, which authorized the use of force against those responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The resolution also called upon all states to cooperate fully with international efforts to bring about peace and stability in Afghanistan. On January 7, 2003, President George W.

Upon interviewing the woman, it was determined that she had been infected by her nephew, who died within 48 hours. Lissy took the news to the director of the hospital to whom she had applied to join the medical team. The director rejected Lissy's application until he was impressed with her work there in an earlier assignment. He contacted her, and they agreed to send her on the same mission to treat a similar Ebola patient – and did so in February 2006.\n\nIn November 2006, Lissy flew to Ethiopia where she was among a team of international medical staff in Ethiopia's Western region, fighting the highly contagious Ebola virus. There she treated three Ebola survivors, the first within hours of her arrival, and the second at a hospital approximately 20 km from the first. Both patients survived without any apparent infection.\n\nDuring the mission, Dr. Verhelst recommended Lissy for an Assistant Professor post at the Graduate Program in Public Health at McGill University in Montreal. The GPPH is a unique program that allows students to complete a doctoral program in public health with a focus on the medical aspects of infectious disease.\n\nA graduate student studying in Montreal gets to experience a wide range of different cultures, and work in a supportive",

    "\"The name Selam Woldemariam translates to mean 'the good place', as it is used in the Qur'aan. Selam Woldemariam, also translated as 'the heaven of holiness', is a reference to the area of the Qur'aan that is named the Selam-i Layla. The word Selam-i Layla is derived from the verse \"Selek'in ya qalim al-aslama wa al-'amalatna ma al-ahdala wa al-ayma wa al-qalimun, wal-qadirun kareemun a'lamun, wa takhreejun 'ala kawthumum, 'ala bayna qadirun\" from Surat al-Atba' (Chapter 21). The Qur'aan explains that Allah 'created your heavens and your earth, yet did not place in them any intercessor save the Name Allah, and made for each place in their own abode, or heavens and earths, but Allah did not place any intercessor except Him in each place, nor sent down any rain except from the clouds only.\" (Sura al-Atba' (Chapter 21), Arabic Text) On 6.12.14, a day on which God sent rain in Egypt, the sky turned bright blue. The 'blue sky' was a beautiful rainbow. People could scarcely believe the event that they were witnessing. People thought it to be an omen of God's great favor, and felt sure that this day was on the same scale as Friday of the month of Muharram. The people in the vicinity believed that there was a miracle. The Egyptian people also held a special ceremony in which some people shaved their heads. On that day they decided that if there was any sign that the rain would stop during the time the Pharaoh, who is the leader of the opposition, was on the river bank, they should come out and celebrate the 'blue sky' event, and in all probability end their hunger and thirst. And there were many miracles that day and that will be told in another article. But the main thing is that this event was significant for mankind, for it allowed them to believe that they could rely on God to bring rain. In this article, Selam Woldemariam is meant 'the",
    "This paper begins with a conceptual examination, and offers several reasons that it is difficult to see how this can be done without adopting some associationism or other kind of functional analysis. It then goes on to evaluate the implications of the current state of research in cognitive ethology. Finally, it concludes with suggestions for future work.\n\n[Source 1:] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_theory\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis\n\nWhat's wrong with it? Doesn't it sound like I'm saying (1) there are multiple explanations for human behavior; and (2) they all must have their advantages and disadvantages? That would certainly seem true according to the standard interpretation of this and many other concepts within behavioral science.\n\nOn both counts the basic problem is an obvious one. There is no single explanatory construct, method, concept, data, etc which makes the universe, our brains, people, behavior, whatever you want to call it behave as we normally understand them to behave. Instead, we need to get our terms straight if we're ever going to do anything useful with \"explain\" at all to anyone – let alone ourselves.\n\nNowadays there's quite enough room on wiki to say that we humans do not act rationally and that those who claim otherwise are mistaken, or at least misrepresent themselves. But it would take some effort just to define words properly. The most commonly used ones right now aren't even used correctly by anyone else! Let us try to make use of them rather than getting hung up trying to explain everything in terms of what nobody understands, because everyone already knows what they mean.\n\nWe humans live very messy lives to begin with, and all this mess has left its mark on psychology; but there's still a large amount of confusion about it. What does \"rational\" really mean?\n\nSo basically how do we know we behave rationally when we don't? We have plenty of observations and experiments from animal species which could show that humans do sometimes behave in ways which clearly contradict each other, yet our intuitions insist that these actions are perfectly rational. Isn't this evidence against our common sense view of why we make sense of things? How will we ever figure out when something doesn't fit together properly before we find out that most people think it's irrational anyway?!",
    "Marzotto was a member of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and a leader in the anti-fascist resistance during World War II, serving as a commander in the Italian Resistance. He was arrested by the Gestapo on May 1, 1946 for his involvement with the Red Brigades, but escaped to Switzerland where he lived until his death in 1980.\n\nIn the early 1940s, Marzotto had been active in the PCI's youth wing, the Piazza del Popolo, which was founded in 1943. In 1944, he joined the PCI's political bureau, the Central Committee of the PCI, and became its secretary general in 1945. After the war, he served as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly, and later as a member of the International Commission on Human Rights.\n\nAfter the war, Marzotto worked as a journalist and editor at several newspapers, including Il Manifesto, La Repubblica, and Corriere della Serra. He also edited the newspaper L'Espresso, and wrote numerous articles about politics and culture. His most famous work was The Black Book of Communism, published in 1950.\n\nOn April 30, 1947, Marzotto was arrested by the Gestapo and taken to Auschwitz. There, he was interrogated by SS officers and forced to sign a confession that he had collaborated with the Nazis. On June 17, 1948, he was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.\n\nDuring his time in prison, Marzotto met fellow prisoners who were members of the Red Brigade, a group of partisans fighting against the Nazi occupation.

In 1949, Marzotto helped organize a conference in Rome called \"Dialogue between Communists and Fascists.\" At this meeting, Marzotto and other former partisans discussed ways to combat fascism.\n\nIn 1951, Marzotto was released from prison and returned to Italy. He then began working as a journalist again, writing for various publications, including La Stampa, La Nuova Bussola, and Il Manifesto.

As a result of these actions China has begun retaliatory trade proceedings in May 2014 through both bilateral negotiations and multilateral bodies against several key products under consideration in Singapore such as Chinese steel and solar panels but so far no concrete results have been achieved.[10][11]\n\n\nWith regards to education, an estimated 80% of tertiary students attend government schools which are subject to a compulsory state assessment procedure based primarily on memorisation (i.e., RATI).

    "Bill C-51 (The Anti-Terrorism Act, 2015, enacted April 6, 2015) allows for the arrest and detention, without charge or trial, and without a warrant, of non-combatant Canadians involved in terrorist activities at home or abroad, if \"their activities reasonably appear\" to be related to international terrorism. The bill gives the government unprecedented powers to detain Canadians for up to nine months without charge or trial, provide them with less access to courts and the police, and limit their ability to meet with their lawyers and family members. Under the government's \"criminal activity report\", CSIS can share information about Canadian citizens or permanent residents with police forces in overseas countries without a warrant.\n\nThe legislation includes vague and overbroad definitions of what could constitute \"terrorist activity\" and \"terrorist propaganda\", which is used by CSIS to target Canadians. Bill C-51 provides the Minister of National Defence with broad powers to prevent Canadians from participating in or supporting \"terrorism\", with few limits. It also permits the government to revoke Canadians' Canadian citizenship at any time.\n\nBill C-51 was introduced without any oversight hearings or public consultation with Canadians, with the opposition parties being told they would have until October 7, 2015 to provide an alternative to \"the government's agenda\" or else face \"consequences.\" Prime Minister Stephen Harper tabled Bill C-51 in the House of Commons, saying: \"We've heard reports of Canadian citizens acting alone or in small numbers facilitating terrorist activity in other parts of the world. It is very clear to the government that these terrorist activities pose a real threat to Canadian safety and security.\n\n\"We are on an international terrorist watch list for over a decade and we must have a plan to deal with it if Canadians are ever to become a threat to this country.\"\n\nHarper's spokesperson said the Prime Minister has been aware of the concerns over Bill C-51 since the legislation was introduced.

In Iraq the 5th Battalion, 5th Field Artillery Regiment and the 576th Regiment were engaged with an air assault known as 'Operation Iraqi Freedom.' The Army refers to it as an 'all-hands-on-deck' operation as heavy support units are needed to get around in remote locations.\n\nIn Afghanistan, soldiers in heavy support gear were sent to Helmand province to assist with clearing.

    "Scythia, the Greek name for a mythical land of monsters like scorpions, centaurs, jackalopes and so on, was one of the main inspiration for the legendary city of Lemuria in the South Pacific. It is well placed in this respect, because in many of the legends it was the place of the \"mother of the gods\", where some of the earliest and most primitive humans could be seen as they struggled against a more advanced civilisation. The \"Lemurians\" were, in modern folklore, not the human type but one of the most ancient, and they worshiped the \"Scythians\". It is the mythology around the \"Scythians\" which gave birth to the legend of the \"lost continent\" which is so popular today, but in an ancient version they were the survivors of a previous, and much more advanced species.\n\nThis article is copyrighted and unauthorized reproduction is prohibited.\n\nIf you wish to use this article online or in print, please contact us to request permission.",
    "\"A hacktivist group, often referred to as a band or collective, is a loosely organized group of hackers that work together on a common goal. Hackers are usually anonymous and do not have any formal organization.\"\n\nI'm sure you can see where this is going. I've been thinking about how to describe myself for quite some time now. I don't want to be a hacker, but I also don't want to be a member of Anonymous. I think it's important to understand what these groups are all about before we get into the nitty gritty of their activities.\n\nAnonymous has become synonymous with online activism in recent years. The group was founded by a group of computer experts who wanted to create a more open internet. They were inspired by the Arab Spring protests and the Occupy movement. In 2011, they launched Operation Payback against websites hosting child pornography. This operation resulted in the arrest of several people including the founder of the site.\n\nIn 2012, Anonymous took down the website of the Church of Scientology after its members posted personal information about Tom Cruise. It also hacked into Sony Pictures Entertainment and stole private emails.\n\nThis year, Anonymous has taken down the websites of PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, and Bank of America. These companies refused to pay out money to WikiLeaks when the whistleblowing website released classified documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThese actions have earned them the title of \"hacktivists\". However, there is no official definition of what a hacktivist actually is. There are many different definitions of hacking, but most agree that it involves breaking into computers and stealing data.\n\nThere are other types of hackers too. For example, there are those who break into systems to steal credit card numbers. There are others who use social engineering techniques to gain access to networks. And then there are those who simply try to cause chaos through cyber attacks.\n\nSo, what does Anonymous stand for? Well, it's hard to say exactly. But one thing is clear – they're not just about protesting. They're about creating change.\n\nThey believe that governments should be transparent and accountable. They believe that corporations should be held accountable for their actions. They believe that the Internet should be free and accessible to everyone.\n\nAnd they believe that if enough people join forces, they can make a difference.\n\nWhat do you",
    "This is the fifth article in a 6-part series on Hex Enduction Hour. For more information on how HP works, see HP. For more information about the Hex Sidekick game, see Hex Sidekick.\n\nThe hex sidekick is a powerful enemy, whose powers derive from a particular resource that can be stolen. A hex sidekick must be defeated in order for the player's hero to advance. A hex sidekick's abilities may allow it to make a critical attack, inflict critical damage, or perform a powerful action that would otherwise be impossible. The hex sidekick has the power to steal the resource of a specific creature, or a combination of creatures from various categories, in order to be defeated.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, a player must choose a hero as their hero sidekick and choose a hex sidekick as their hex sidekick for the game. The hex sidekick must be chosen over the hero's hero sidekick if the game rules allow. The hero's hex sidekick must not be the hex sidekick of the player's hex sidekick.\n\nSome hex sidekicks have limited abilities, and require special abilities that are provided by the Hex Sidekick rules. Each hex sidekick hero has a specific category of creatures as a limit to their abilities. Some hex sidekick hero categories have a number of creatures in that category equal to 3, and the hex sidekick's power is the strength of the number of creatures in this category.\n\nAll of a player's hex sidekicks have a single power, that being their ability to steal a specific resource, from a specific creature type, or the combination of a number of creatures of a specific type. It is not possible to have two hex sidekicks with the same power. A hex sidekick cannot steal from a different type of creature than the one being attacked, so using a hex sidekick's power to attack a creature's resources would break the game (though this is possible if the hex sidekick possesses the proper item in order to access a different resource). If the player cannot physically make it to a hex team, their hex sidekicks must take the role of non-hero sidekicks, making use of the powers of a hero by using the same hex sidekick. Hex Sidekick also offers an option in addition to just stealing resources from an opponent, for the use of specific tactics",

    "\n\nSupernormal stimuli are sensory inputs that are more intense, vivid, or salient than what is typically experienced. The term was coined by zoologist Niko Tinbergen to refer to the intense colors and patterns on the shells of certain tropical butterflies that attract predators. Supernormal stimuli can occur in any sense modality, and have been extensively studied in the visual, auditory, and olfactory domains.\n\n Supernormal stimuli are often associated with evolutionary processes, as they can confer a selective advantage. For example, the gaudy colors of some tropical butterflies may help them escape detection by predators, while the loud calls of certain bird species may help them find mates. Supernormal stimuli can also be exploited by animals in captivity, leading to behaviors that are not seen in the wild. For example, domestic chickens prefer to peck at larger, more colorful targets, even when these targets are not food.\n\nThe study of supernormal stimuli has implications for understanding both normal and abnormal behavior. For instance, the over-stimulation of certain sense modalities can lead to perceptual distortions and even hallucinations. In some cases, such as with eating disorders, the pursuit of supernormal stimuli can become pathological.",

    "\n\nDeglaciation is the geological process that results in the loss of glacial ice and global warming. This process can occur on a variety of time scales: from millennia to decades.\n\nOver the past two centuries, the world's average temperature has increased by about 0.7 °C (1.3 °F). This warming trend is largely due to emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and clearing forests.\n\nAs the Earth's climate warms, glaciers and ice sheets around the world are melting. This melting ice releases water into the oceans, which causes sea level to rise. Deglaciation also affects the Earth's climate in other ways.\n\nFor example, as glaciers melt, they expose bare rock that absorbs heat from the sun. This dark rock then warms the air above it, which can cause more melting. Additionally, melting glaciers can release dust and other particles into the atmosphere, which can affect the Earth's climate in a number of ways.\n\nThe effects of deglaciation are already being felt around the world and are expected to increase in the future. The loss of glaciers will cause sea level to rise, which will affect coastal communities and habitats.

    "Evolutionary biology is a subfield of biology that studies the evolutionary processes that produced the diversity of life on Earth. These processes include natural selection, common descent, and speciation. The discipline emerged through what Julian Huxley called the modern synthesis of understanding from several previously distinct fields of biological research, including genetics, ecology, systematics, and paleontology.\n\nAt the most basic level, evolutionary biology is concerned with changes in populations, species, or groups of species. It seeks to understand the origins and development of life, from single-celled organisms to complex multicellular organisms, including humans. The study of evolutionary biology involves the examination of both living species and fossils, as well as genetic data.\n\nThe central concept of evolutionary biology is the theory of evolution, first formulated by Charles Darwin in the mid-19th century. This theory posits that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce. This process, known as natural selection, leads to the adaptation of species to their environment and the development of new species.\n\nAnother key concept in evolutionary biology is the idea of common descent, which suggests that all life shares a common ancestor. This is supported by evidence from a wide range of scientific fields, including paleontology, comparative anatomy, and molecular biology. The concept of common descent helps to explain why organisms can be classified into a hierarchical \"tree of life,\" from the broadest taxonomic groups (domains) to the narrowest (species).\n\nEvolutionary biology also studies the process of speciation, or the formation of new and distinct species in the course of evolution. This can occur through various mechanisms, such as geographic isolation, genetic drift, and sexual selection. Understanding speciation is crucial for explaining the immense biodiversity found on Earth.\n\nIn recent years, evolutionary biology has been enriched by the integration of molecular biology, which has provided detailed information about the genetic basis of evolution. This has led to the development of the field of molecular evolution, which studies the processes and outcomes of evolution at the molecular level.\n\nEvolutionary biology has wide-ranging practical applications. For example, it informs the development of new drugs and medical treatments, aids in the conservation of endangered species, and helps to predict and manage the spread of infectious diseases. It also provides a unifying framework for understanding the natural world and our place in it.\n\nIn conclusion, evolutionary biology is a dynamic and continually evolving field that seeks to explain the complexity and diversity of life on Earth.

    "Ālī Qāpū (Persian: عالی‌ قاپو‎, ‘Ālī Qāpū) is a grand palace located in Isfahan, Iran. It is situated on the western side of the Naqsh-e Jahan Square, opposite to Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque, and had been originally designed as a vast portal. The name Ālī Qāpū, from Arabic ‘Ālī, \"Imperial or Great\", and Turkic Qāpū meaning \"gate\", was given to this place as it was right at the entrance to the Safavid palaces which stretched from the Naqsh-e Jahan Square to the Chahar Baq Boulevard. The building, another wonderful Safavid edifice, was built by decree of Shah Abbas I in the early seventeenth century.\n\nThe palace is forty-eight meters high and there are six floors, each accessible by a difficult spiral staircase. In the sixth floor, the Music Hall, deep circular niches are found in the walls, having not only aesthetic value, but also acoustic. The building is rich in naturalistic wall paintings by Reza Abbasi, the court painter of Shah Abbas I, and his pupils. There are floral, animal, and bird motifs.\n\nThe highly ornamented doors and windows of the palace have almost all been pillaged at times of social anarchy. Only one window on the third floor has escaped the ravages of time. Ālī Qāpū was repaired and restored substantially during the reign of Shah Sultan Hussein, the last Safavid ruler, but fell into a dreadful state of dilapidation again during the short reign of invading Afghans. Under the Qajar Nasir al-Din shah's reign (1848–96), the Safavid cornices and floral tiles above the portal were replaced by tiles bearing inscriptions.\n\nĀlī Qāpū is rich in naturalistic wall paintings. The paintings on the walls and ceilings of the palace are the work of Reza Abbasi. The subjects of the paintings are mostly flowers and animals, including horses, birds and wild animals. The Iranian crown jewels are said to have been kept at Ālī Qāpū in the past.\n\nThe palace is an important historical site, and is listed with UNESCO as a part of the larger historic complex of Naqsh-e Jahan Square, which is a World Heritage Site.

Born in 1967 in San Antonio, Texas, Schwegler has garnered acclaim for her innovative approach and profound ideas that often explore themes of decay, failure, and the generally unseen or overlooked aspects of daily life. Her particular blend of traditional craft techniques and thought-provoking conceptuality has made significant contributions to the contemporary art discourse.\n\nSchwegler earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts in Painting from the University of Kansas in 1990 and then proceeded to the University of Oregon for a Master of Fine Arts in Metalsmithing, where she graduated with honors in 1996. \n\nHer notable works include \"I borrowed optimism from the past\" (2019), a series of enlarged and meticulously rendered used drinking straws, and “Empty Promise” (2013), a 7-foot-tall cast aluminum sculpture of a deteriorating garden gnome. Both pieces explore Schwegler’s fascination with the aftermath of the discarded and how it represents societal values and obsessions. \n\nSchwegler’s work has been exhibited extensively in the United States and abroad. She has had solo shows at venues such as the Portland Art Museum, the Sculpture Center in Cleveland, and the Blue Star Contemporary Art Museum in San Antonio.

    "Albrecht Dürer (21 May 1471 – 6 April 1528) was a German painter, printmaker, and theorist from Nuremberg. His body of work includes altarpieces, religious works, numerous portraits and self-portraits, as well as copper engravings. His woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavor than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium.\n\nDürer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective, and ideal proportions.\n\nDürer was born on 21 May 1471, third child and second son of his parents, who had between fourteen and eighteen children. His father was a successful goldsmith, originally Ajtós, near Gyula in Hungary. He moved to Nuremberg in 1455 where he married Barbara Holper, daughter of his master.\n\nIn 1486, Dürer was apprenticed to the Nuremberg painter and printmaker Michael Wolgemut, where he would remain for about four years. He soon traveled to Italy, where he would learn much about the Renaissance developments. He returned to Nuremberg in 1495, opened a workshop and began to produce woodcut prints.\n\nOne of Dürer's most significant contributions to the art world was his works on the laws of proportion, \"The Four Books on Measurement\" and \"Four Books on Human Proportion\". Dürer’s exploration of human proportions laid down the groundwork for future artists and set a precedent for analyzing human anatomy.\n\nThere are few definitive records of Dürer's thoughts on contemporary events. His writings are predominantly observations on art, particularly measurements and proportions for artists, as well as reflections on his own artworks.\n\nIn 1528, Dürer died in Nuremberg at the age of 56, leaving an estate valued at 6,874 florins—a considerable sum.

His work at Gordion lasted for nearly 25 years, during which he made several significant discoveries, including the tomb of King Midas, which contained a wealth of artifacts that provided valuable insights into Phrygian culture and history.\n\nYoung's approach to archaeology was meticulous and innovative. He was one of the first archaeologists to use stratigraphy, a method that involves analyzing the layers of an archaeological site to understand its chronological sequence. This approach allowed him to reconstruct the history of Gordion and its people in remarkable detail.\n\nIn addition to his fieldwork, Young was a prolific writer. He published numerous articles and books on his findings at Gordion and other archaeological sites.

    "Coptic Cairo is a part of the Egyptian capital that is known for being the heart of the country's Christian community. The area spans from the northern part of Old Cairo to southern parts of the new province. This region's substantial historical significance has dutifully earned it a spot as one of Cairo's must-see tourist destinations. \n\nCoptic Cairo is often referred to as 'Old Cairo' because it hosts some of the oldest Christian churches in Egypt, many ancient mosques, and Jewish synagogues dating back to the time when the city served as the capital of Egypt. This intermingling of religious spaces showcases the area's rich history of diverse cultural and religious interactions. \n\nThe area is densely packed with significant historic edifices, including the Hanging Church (Saint Virgin Mary's Coptic Orthodox Church), which was built in the 7th century over a gatehouse of Babylon Fortress, standing as one of the oldest surviving Christian churches in Egypt. The Coptic Museum, situated within the grounds of the Coptic Orthodox Church, houses the world's most extensive collection of Coptic Christian artwork and artifacts. The Ben Ezra Synagogue, thought to be built in the 9th century, is a fascinating place of Jewish worship with a rich historical narrative surrounding it. \n\nAt the heart of Coptic Cairo is the fortress of Babylon, around which the Roman Emperor Trajan built the city of Cairo in AD 116. The juxtaposition of Roman, early-Christian, and Islamic architecture all within such a compact area helps to tell Cairo's diverse and fascinating history. \n\nBeyond the religious and historical sites, Coptic Cairo has a distinctive charm of its own. The narrow alleyways and passages meander through centuries-old structures, offering a glimpse into an era bygone. Visitors can explore traditional craft shops and spice markets, sip a traditional Egyptian tea at one of the many cafes, or simply imbibe in the labyrinthine beauty of the historic district. \n\nCoptic Cairo represents more than just a religious or historical significance. It embodies a sense of unity that bridges today's different Coptic and Muslim communities. One cannot truly understand the remarkable city of Cairo without exploring the richness and depth that Coptic Cairo has to offer. \n\nThe maintenance, preservation, and ongoing archaeological recovery efforts in the area reflect the Egyptian government's commitment to preserving and showcasing the rich cultural heritage of Coptic Cairo. This makes the district not only a hub for religious activity but also an essential center of historical, archaeological, and tourist interest. \n\nIn conclusion, Coptic Cairo is a",
    "Leonti Mroveli (Georgian: ლეონტი მროველი), which translates to \"Leon the Traveller\", was a Georgian chronicler and author of the 11th century. He is frequently referenced in analysis of Georgian historical literature, known primarily for his significant input in the medieval \"Georgian Chronicles\". His work forms the earliest comprehensive history of Georgia and the Caucasians.\n\nLeonti Mroveli's exact birth date remains unknown, but historical examination points to him being active during the reign of King Bagrat IV of Georgia, suggesting that he lived around the turn of the 11th century. His name, Mroveli, which means \"the traveller\" in Georgian, denotes an individual who travels from place to place, typically a cleric or a trader, which may indicate his social status or occupation.\n\nLeonti Mroveli's main work is \"Georgian Chronicles\", also known as \"The Life of Kartli\". The chronicle presents a blend of mythological narrative and historical events, taking readers back to the era of the biblical descendants of Noah and then tracing the lineage of the Georgians, or 'Kartvelians', from Noah’s son Japheth and grandson Togarmah. Despite the heavy leanings on biblical mythology and royal genealogy, the chronicles also provide invaluable information about the socio-political landscape of the Caucasus region from the 4th to the 11th centuries.\n\nContributions from Leonti Mroveli form the first part of the Georgian Chronicles, which is often referred to as \"The Chronicle of Leonti Mroveli\". His writings include the history of the conversion of Georgia to Christianity, the reign of Mirian III, the wars with Iran in the 5th century, and the life of King Vakhtang Gorgasali. His accounts are considered somewhat reliable by historians, although they are occasionally marked by errors and anachronisms, primarily due to the oral transmission of these tales before they were written down.\n\nLater in his life, Leonti Mroveli became the Bishop of Ruisi, one of the oldest episcopal sees in Georgia. He remained in this position until his death.\n\nThe writings of Leonti Mroveli make up a critical part of the Georgian literary tradition and the national identity.

    "HMS Rodney (29) was one of two Nelson-class battleships built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1920s. Named after Admiral Lord Rodney, the ship was commissioned in 1927 and served extensively during the Second World War. \n\n== Design and Description ==\n\nHMS Rodney was designed in accordance with the limitations set by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. The treaty, which aimed to prevent a naval arms race after World War I, restricted the displacement, armament, and armour of new battleships. As a result, HMS Rodney and her sister ship, HMS Nelson, were unique in their design among British battleships.\n\nHMS Rodney had a length of 710 feet, a beam of 106 feet, and a draught of 33 feet. She was powered by Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines, driving two propeller shafts, which developed a total of 45,000 shaft horsepower and gave a maximum speed of 23 knots. \n\nThe ship's main armament consisted of nine 16-inch guns in three triple turrets, two forward and one aft, a configuration necessitated by the Treaty's restrictions. Her secondary armament included twelve 6-inch guns, six 4.7-inch anti-aircraft guns, and a variety of smaller calibre weapons.\n\n== Service History ==\n\nHMS Rodney served extensively during the Second World War. She was part of the Home Fleet and participated in several campaigns, including the Norwegian Campaign and the hunt for the German battleship Bismarck. \n\nIn May 1941, HMS Rodney played a crucial role in the sinking of the Bismarck. Along with the battleship HMS King George V, she engaged the Bismarck in a prolonged battle, during which Rodney fired a total of 340 16-inch shells, scoring several hits and contributing significantly to the Bismarck's eventual destruction.\n\nAfter the Bismarck engagement, HMS Rodney continued to serve in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Arctic theatres. She provided cover for several Arctic convoys, supported the Allied invasion of North Africa in 1942, and participated in the Normandy landings in 1944.\n\n== Decommissioning and Fate ==\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, HMS Rodney was decommissioned in 1945 due to her poor condition and the Royal Navy's post-war downsizing. She was sold for scrap in 1948 and broken up at Inverkeithing.\n\nDespite her relatively short service life",

Known for his distinctive lo-fi aesthetic and eclectic range of influences, Ariel Pink first garnered recognition as a home-recording pioneer of the 2000s.

    "The Whinchat (Saxicola rubetra) is a small migratory passerine bird that is categorized under the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae. It is primarily found across Europe and Asia, with its winter habitats extending to Central and Southern Africa. The name \"Whinchat\" derives from the Anglo-Saxon word for the common gorse (whin) and \"chat\" that translates to a small bird.\n\nThe Whinchat is distinctive for its white supercilium, a line running from the bill to just behind the eyes, which is bordered with black. Males have rich brown upper-parts with dark streaks and pale buffy or orangish-yellow underparts, with wings featuring distinct white patches. Females, on the other hand, are more subdued in colour, being mostly buff and brown.\n\nWhinchats prefer a range of habitats such as heaths, rough grasslands, and open country with shrubs and small trees. They feed primarily on insects which they catch after a brief aerial pursuit. During breeding seasons, they build a ground-level nest concealed in dense vegetation, laying between 4 to 7 eggs at a time, which are incubated by both parents.\n\nThese bird species have an extensive vocal range, delivering a series of soft whistling notes with a 'tacc-tacc-tacc' sound. They can also mimic the songs of other birds. Due to their distinct appearances and lovely singing, Whinchats are frequently spotted by birdwatchers and are much admired for their beauty.\n\nLike other insects-eating birds, Whinchats are significantly affected by changes in farming practices, primarily the increased use of pesticides. The global population has been in decline, prompting conservation measures in several countries. Despite this, as of 2021, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified the Whinchat as a species of \"Least Concern.\"\n\nAgencies, such as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) in the United Kingdom, are rolling out conservation initiatives to sustain the local populations by promoting bird-friendly farming practices. This involves leaving areas of rough grassland for foraging, delayed mowing and reducing pesticide usage.\n\nResearched continuously by ornithologists, the Whinchat contributes significantly to the understanding of bird migration patterns. Their distinctive nature, coupled with their expansive habitats, provides an enormous range for study and understanding of various ecosystems. Furthermore, as a symbol of biodiversity, their continued presence in their habitats indicates",

He was among the most radical of Japan's leaders, advocating for the country's expansionist policies and leading it into the Pacific War against the Allies.\n\nBorn in Tokyo, Tojo was the third son of Hidenori Tojo, a lieutenant general in the Imperial Japanese Army. He followed in his father's footsteps, joining the army in 1905 and steadily rising through the ranks. He was a career military man, serving in various capacities including as Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army in Manchuria from 1937 to 1938.\n\nTojo was appointed as Minister of War in the cabinet of Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe in 1940. He was a strong advocate for Japan's alliance with the Axis Powers, which was formalized in the Tripartite Pact of September 1940. In 1941, following the resignation of Konoe, Tojo assumed the role of Prime Minister. He held this position until July 1944, when he was forced to resign due to Japan's deteriorating war situation.\n\nAs Prime Minister, Tojo was responsible for the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, which led to the United States' entry into World War II. His government also carried out numerous war crimes, including the forced labor and mistreatment of prisoners of war, and the infamous Nanking Massacre.\n\nAfter Japan's surrender in 1945, Tojo was arrested by the Allied forces and charged with war crimes. He was found guilty on eight counts, including waging wars of aggression, and war crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to death and executed by hanging in 1948.\n\nTojo's legacy is controversial. In Japan, he is often viewed as a symbol of Japanese militarism and its consequences. However, he also has his defenders, who argue that he was a patriot who did what he believed was necessary for Japan's survival. Internationally, he is best known as the face of Japanese aggression during World War II. His role in the war and his subsequent trial and execution have made him a significant figure in discussions about war responsibility and justice.",

    "A \"Liberal arts education\" is a systematic approach to learning that focuses on multi-disciplinary knowledge, critical thinking, analytical reasoning, and comprehensive problem-solving skills. Dating back to the ancient Greeks, this broad learning model is the foundation of western education and is designed to produce well-rounded individuals with general knowledge in a variety of subjects.\n\nLiberal arts education can be distinguished from vocational, technical, professional, and pre-professional education, which are more narrowly focused programs that generally prepare students for a specific career. The curriculum in a liberal arts program often includes humanities, social sciences, creative arts, and science and mathematics. This often includes literature, philosophy, languages, history, sociology, psychology, visual arts, and a basic understanding of the natural and social sciences.\n\nApart from offering a diverse range of subjects, the liberal arts education aims to develop the intellectual abilities of students. These abilities include analytical thinking, communication skills, problem-solving skills, and an understanding of ethical issues. It values the ability to comprehend and construct arguments, engage in a civil dialogue, and appreciate the value of different perspectives. \n\nIn its classical form, the liberal arts included just seven subjects: grammar, rhetoric, logic (the \"trivium\"), along with arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music (the \"quadrivium\"). This illustrates the origin of liberal arts as a program designed around fostering rational inquiry, intellectual versatility, and the development of knowledgeable citizens.\n\nThe role and relevance of liberal arts education have been the subject of prolonged debate. Those who advocate for it argue that it produces well-rounded individuals who can respond to changes in the market better than those with a narrow discipline specialization. Critics, on the other hand, argue that a liberal arts education does not provide the specific skills needed for specific careers and may thus limit career opportunities.\n\nHowever, it is generally agreed that a liberal arts education provides the tools to understand complex issues, evaluate arguments, and communicate effectively, critical skills in any profession. Additionally, elements of a liberal arts education are often integrated into specialized and professional degrees to broaden outlooks and enhance critical thinking skills.\n\nIn recent times, liberal arts education has been integrated into the curriculum of various international university models, such as those of some European and Asian universities. Nevertheless, it remains most associated with universities in the United States, where liberal arts institutions have continued to thrive.\n\nThe future of liberal arts education continues to be a subject of debate, with some predicting its decline due to economic pressures and the increasing emphasis on vocational training. However, others argue that as the job",

    "Retour des cendres (French for \" Return of the ashes\") is a symbolic ceremony in which a person's cremated remains are returned to their homeland or place of origin. The practice has gained popularity in recent years, particularly among people who have lived away from their home country for an extended period of time or have a strong connection to their ancestral land.\n\nThe idea behind retour des cendres is that a person's spirit continues to reside in the place where their physical form once existed, and that by returning their ashes to this location, they can be reunited with their ancestors and cultural heritage. This belief is rooted in various cultures and religions around the world, including Native American, African, and Asian traditions.\n\nThere are several ways in which return des cendres can take place. In some cases, family members may choose to scatter the ashes themselves, either privately or during a formal ceremony led by community leaders or spiritual officials. Alternatively, groups may organize collective returns, where multiple individuals' ashes are brought back to their shared homeland or place of significance. Some families also opt for a combination approach splitting the ashes between a personal return journey and interment in a communal site.\n\nReturning one's ashes to a specific location conveys significant meaning: it represents respect for one's beginnings while acknowledging the impact of diaspora experiences on shaping identity; furthermore, it celebrates belonging across generations through reconnection with kinship ties and rebuilding relationships within communities left behind. Whether done individually or collectively these rituals serve as powerful reminders of our deep connections both living lineages & ancestral lands- connecting past present & future through memory culture heritage spirituality tradition renewal transformation growth .

    "Sure, here's a possible body for a Wikipedia article titled \"100th Window\":\n\n100th Window is a term used in software development and testing to refer to a hypothetical window that is never opened by a user. It is a humorous way of referring to a feature or bug that is difficult or impossible to reproduce, and is often used to describe a problem that is considered unsolvable or unimportant.\n\nThe term \"100th window\" comes from the idea that a user may open many windows during the course of using a software application, but they are unlikely to ever open a 100th window. Similarly, a bug or feature that is difficult to reproduce may be considered a \"100th window\" issue, as it is unlikely to be encountered by the average user.\n\nThe concept of the 100th window has been used in various ways in software development and testing. For example, some developers may use the term to refer to a bug that is particularly difficult to reproduce, or to describe a feature that is not considered a priority. Testers may use the term to refer to a test case that is unlikely to be executed, or to describe a scenario that is not considered likely to occur in real-world usage.\n\nThe 100th window concept has also been used in software project management to prioritize resources and efforts. For example, a project manager may decide to focus on the most critical bugs or features first, and leave the \"100th window\" issues for later, if resources allow.\n\nThe term \"100th window\" has also been used in a broader sense to refer to any issue that is considered low-priority or unlikely to occur. For example, a support technician may use the term to describe a problem that is not considered critical, or a developer may use it to describe a feature that is not considered essential.\n\nIn summary, the term \"100th window\" is a humorous way of referring to a hypothetical window that is never opened by a user, and is often used in software development and testing to describe a bug or feature that is difficult or impossible to reproduce.

    "Cuniptau Mines is a vast underground network of tunnels and chambers located in the heart of the Cuniptau Mountains, a rugged range in western Elyria. The mines have been operational for centuries, with generations of dwarves working tirelessly to extract valuable minerals and metals from the depths of the earth.\n\nThe entrance to the mines is guarded by a large stone portal, adorned with ancient runes that tell the story of the dwarves' history and their connection to the land. The portal leads to a series of narrow tunnels that wind deep into the mountainside, gradually descending into the darkness beneath. The air inside the tunnels is thick with the smell of earth and rock, and the sound of pickaxes striking stone echoes through the caverns.\n\nAs you delve deeper into the mines, the tunnels open up into expansive chambers filled with glittering crystals and precious ores. The walls are lined with veins of gold, silver, and copper, and the ground is rich with deposits of iron, coal, and gems. It is said that the mines contain enough wealth to make any man rich beyond his wildest dreams, but the danger involved in extracting it has made the endeavor prohibitively expensive for all but the bravest and most skilled dwarves.\n\nDespite the risks, the dwarves continue to work the mines with relentless determination, motivated by something more than just greed. They see themselves as the stewards of the earth, extracted from the bowels of mother Elyria herself. Each generation passes down knowledge and expertise to the next, honoring the delicate balance between extraction and preservation.\n\nHowever, this harmony is not without its challenges. The threat of cave-ins hangs ever present over those who venture too far below the surface. Gas pockets can ignite, turning a narrow tunnel into a deadly furnace. The risk is exacerbated by the supernatural forces rumored to inhabit the deepest reaches of the mines. Whispers spread throughout the Caverns of malicious spirits drawn into the delves by",

    "Evolutionary biology is a subfield of biology that focuses on the study of the evolution of species and the patterns and processes that have shaped the diversity of life on Earth. It is a multidisciplinary field that draws on concepts and techniques from genetics, ecology, paleontology, and other related fields to understand the evolution of species and the interactions between organisms and their environments.\n\nThe central idea of evolutionary biology is that all living organisms share a common ancestor and have evolved over time through the process of natural selection. This process, first described by Charles Darwin in his book \"On the Origin of Species,\" posits that individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits on to their offspring. Over time, these small changes can accumulate and result in the development of new species.\n\nOne of the key concepts in evolutionary biology is the idea of adaptation. An adaptation is a trait or feature that has evolved to improve an organism's chances of survival and reproduction in its environment. Adaptations can take many forms, such as physical features like wings or camouflage, behaviors like migration or mating, or physiological changes like the development of resistance to disease.\n\nAnother important concept in evolutionary biology is speciation, the process by which a new species emerges from an existing one. This can occur through a variety of mechanisms, such as geographic isolation, genetic isolation, or hybridization. Speciation is thought to have occurred many times throughout Earth's history, leading to the incredible diversity of life that we see today.\n\nIn addition to these core concepts, evolutionary biology also draws on a variety of other areas of study, including genetics, ecology, and paleontology. Genetics provides the tools to study the genetic variation within and between populations, while ecology helps us understand the interactions between organisms and their environments. Paleontology, the study of fossils, provides a window into the history of life on Earth and allows us to reconstruct the evolutionary history of extinct species.\n\nEvolutionary biology has many practical applications in fields such as medicine",
    "Re-make/Re-model: Deconstructing and Rebuilding Artistic Identities\n\nIntroduction\n\nRe-making and re-modeling are common practices in various art forms, including music, film, fashion, and visual arts. These terms refer to the process of taking an existing work or idea and transforming it into something new, often with a different perspective or meaning. This practice has been embraced by artists across different generations and disciplines, as it allows them to breathe new life into old ideas, challenge conventional norms, and explore new possibilities.\n\nThe Concept of Re-making and Re-modeling\n\nRe-making and re-modeling involve deconstructing an original work and recreating it using new materials, techniques, and perspectives. This process can result in vastly different outcomes, ranging from faithful adaptations to radical transformations. The motivation behind this approach varies depending on the artist's intentions and goals. Some may aim to update a classic work for contemporary audiences, while others seek to subvert the original's meaning or question its relevance in modern society.\n\nIn some cases, re-making and re-modeling are driven by technological advancements that allow for new mediums and tools to be used. For example, a filmmaker may choose to recreate a classic movie using cutting-edge computer-generated imagery (CGI), providing a fresh visual experience for viewers. Similarly, musicians might re-record their earlier songs using newer instruments or production software, giving their old material a renewed vigor.\n\nArtists who engage in re-making and re-modeling also have the opportunity to address issues such as cultural appropriation or representation. By updating problematic content or stereotypes, creators can produce more inclusive works that align better with contemporary values and sensitivities.\n\nExamples of Re-Making and Re-Modeling in Different Fields\n\nMusic Industry\n\n Musicians frequently re-record and reinterpret their songs, sometimes resulting in drastically different versions. One notable example is Aretha Franklin's rendering of Otis Redding's \"Respect.\" Franklin transformed the song, originally recorded by Redding in 19",

    "Supernormal stimuli refer to artificial or exaggerated versions of natural stimuli that can elicit an enhanced response in animals, including humans. The concept was first introduced by ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen in the 1960s and has since been studied extensively in various fields, including animal behavior, neuroscience, and psychology.\n\nTinbergen observed that some species have innate behaviors that are triggered by specific stimuli, such as a bird's egg-laying behavior being triggered by the sight of a round, smooth object. However, he found that these behaviors could be fooled by supernormal stimuli, which are more intense or exaggerated versions of the natural stimulus. For example, a bird may be more likely to lay eggs on a giant, brightly colored egg than on a real egg.\n\nThe use of supernormal stimuli has helped researchers understand how the brain processes sensory information and how it triggers certain behaviors. By presenting animals with exaggerated versions of natural stimuli, scientists can observe how the brain responds to different aspects of the stimulus, such as its size, color, shape, and movement. This knowledge can then be applied to develop theories about how the brain works and how it controls behavior.\n\nOne of the key findings from studies on supernormal stimuli is that they can often elicit stronger responses than natural stimuli. This is thought to occur because the brain is wired to respond strongly to extreme or unusual versions of natural stimuli, as this would have been beneficial for survival in the wild. For example, a bird that is highly sensitive to large, brightly colored objects may be more likely to notice and respond to a predator or a potential mate.\n\nIn addition to their role in understanding brain function and behavior, supernormal stimuli have also been used in therapy and treatment. For example, some researchers have developed supernormal stimuli to treat phobias, where patients are exposed to gradually increasing levels of the feared stimulus until they become desensitized to it. Similarly, supernormal stimuli have been used to enhance learning and memory, particularly in individuals with neurological disorders such as autism.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that super",

He is currently a professor of applied mathematics and computational complexity at MIT.\n\nResearch Contributions\n\nBedrup's research focuses on understanding the power and limitations of efficient algorithms in various contexts, including online algorithms, algorithmic game theory, and machine learning. He is particularly interested in developing mathematical tools and techniques that can be used to analyze and improve the performance of algorithms in these areas.\n\nOne of Bedrup's most notable contributions is his work on the prophet inequality, which provides a way to prove lower bounds on the competitive ratio of online algorithms. The prophet inequality states that any deterministic online algorithm that makes predictions about the future must have a competitive ratio that is at least as large as the total variation distance between the predictive distributions. This result has been used to establish lower bounds on the competitive ratios of various online algorithms, including those for paging, caching, and ski rental problems.\n\nIn addition to his work on the prophet inequality, Bedrup has made important contributions to other areas of algorithmic game theory and online algorithms. For example, he has developed new techniques for analyzing the convergence behavior of iterative auctions and mechanisms, and has studied the design and analysis of fair allocation rules for cake cutting and resource allocation problems.\n\nAwards and Honors\n\nB",

    "The 2009 Gojra riots refer to a series of violent clashes that took place in the town of Gojra, located in the Punjab province of Pakistan, in August 2009. The riots were sparked by allegations of blasphemy against the local Christian community, and resulted in the deaths of at least seven people, injury to many more, and widespread damage to property.\n\nThe events leading up to the riots began on August 28, 2009, when a local Christian man named Saleem Masih was accused of burning a copy of the Quran, the holy book of Islam. The accusation quickly spread throughout the town, and a group of Muslim residents gathered to protest and demand punishment for Masih. The local police were unable to control the crowd, and the situation quickly escalated into violence.\n\nOver the course of several days, mobs of Muslim residents attacked Christian homes and businesses, setting fire to buildings and vehicles and causing widespread destruction. The police and military were eventually called in to quell the violence, but they were often outnumbered and outmatched by the rioters.\n\nThe violence continued until August 31, when the government imposed a curfew in the town and deployed additional security forces to restore order. By the time the riots had subsided, at least seven people had been killed, including two children, and many more had been injured. Hundreds of homes and businesses had been destroyed, leaving countless people without shelter or livelihoods.\n\nThe Gojra riots were widely condemned by human rights groups and religious leaders, who called for peaceful dialogue and reconciliation between the Muslim and Christian communities.

    "Scotland Yard is the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police Service, which is responsible for law enforcement in the City of London and the surrounding area. Located on Broadway in Westminster, London, Scotland Yard is one of the most famous police stations in the world and has been the site of many historic events.\n\nThe origins of Scotland Yard date back to the 17th century, when the Metropolitan Police Service was first established. At that time, the police force was based at a location called \"The Old Police Office\" in Whitehall. However, as the city grew and the police force expanded, it became clear that a new headquarters was needed. In 1829, the police moved to a new location on Great Scotland Yard, a street off Whitehall. The building was a former residence of the Kings of Scotland, and it was from this location that the police station got its name.\n\nOver the years, Scotland Yard has been the site of many significant events. In 1888, it was the base of operations for the investigation into the Jack the Ripper murders, which took place in the nearby Whitechapel area. In 1901, the police station was the target of a bomb attack by the Irish Republican Army, which caused significant damage and injured several people. During World War II, Scotland Yard played a key role in the war effort, with the police working closely with the military and intelligence agencies to protect the city from Nazi Germany.\n\nScotland Yard is also famous for its association with many famous detectives and investigations. The most famous of these is probably Sherlock Holmes, the fictional detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Holmes is often depicted as working closely with the police at Scotland Yard, and his investigations often take him to the station. In reality, the police at Scotland Yard have been involved in many high-profile investigations, including the aforementioned Jack the Ripper case, as well as the investigation into the 1963 Great Train Robbery and the 1986 London bombings.\n\nIn addition to its role in law enforcement, Scotland Yard has also played a significant role in popular culture.

    "Transferable development rights (TDRs) are a tool used in land use planning and zoning to allow development rights to be transferred from one property to another. The concept of TDRs was first introduced in the United States in the 1960s as a way to preserve agricultural land and open spaces while still allowing for development to occur in urban areas.\n\nThe basic principle behind TDRs is that a property owner who owns land with development rights can sell those rights to another property owner who wants to develop their land in a way that would otherwise be prohibited by zoning regulations. The property owner who sells the development rights is typically required to permanently preserve their land in its natural state or for agricultural use, while the buyer can use the acquired rights to build more densely or for a different purpose than would have been allowed without the TDRs.\n\nTDRs can be transferred in several ways, including:\n\n1. Transfer of development rights (TDR): This is the most common form of TDR, where a property owner sells the right to develop their land to another property owner.\n2. Development rights transfer (DRT): This is similar to TDR, but the transfer is done through a public or private entity, such as a local government or a land trust.\n3. Density transfer: This allows for the transfer of development rights from one property to another within the same zoning district or area, often to encourage more compact and efficient development.\n4. Development credits: This is a monetary incentive for property owners to sell their development rights, which can be used to fund conservation or infrastructure projects.\n\nTDRs have several benefits, including:\n\n1. Preservation of open spaces and agricultural land: By transferring development rights to another property, the original land can be preserved in its natural state or for agricultural use, while still allowing for development to occur in a more appropriate location.\n2. Encouraging compact and efficient development: TDRs can help to promote more compact and efficient development patterns, which can reduce the need for sprawl and preserve open spaces.\n3. Increased property values: TDRs can increase the value of properties that are located in areas with strict zoning regulations, as",

    "Seodaemun Prison, also known as Seoul Prison or Gyeongseong Prison, was a prison located in Seoul, Korea during the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945). The prison was built in 1908 and operated until 1987. During its time, it was one of the largest prisons in Asia and housed many prominent figures who fought against Japanese colonization.\n\nThe prison was designed to hold up to 3,000 prisoners and was notorious for its harsh conditions. Prisoners were subjected to forced labor, physical abuse, and poor living conditions. Many prisoners died due to malnutrition, disease, and mistreatment by guards.\n\nOne of the most famous prisoners held at Seodaemun Prison was Kim Koo, a Korean independence activist who served as the president of the Provisional Government of Korea during World War II. Other notable prisoners included Park Chung-hee, who later became the President of South Korea, and various other politicians, intellectuals, and activists who opposed Japanese rule.\n\nDuring World War II, the prison was used to house political prisoners and those who resisted conscription into the Japanese military. After Japan's defeat in the war, the prison was taken over by the United States Army Military Government in Korea and used to hold Japanese soldiers and collaborators.\n\nIn the years following the end of the war, Seodaemun Prison continued to operate under the government of South Korea. However, it was eventually closed down in 1987 due to concerns about human rights violations and overcrowding. Today, the site where the prison once stood has been turned into a park and memorial dedicated to the victims of Japanese colonialism.\n\nDespite its dark history, Seodaemun Prison remains an important part of modern Korean history and serves as a symbol of resistance against oppression and fight for freedom. It is remembered as a place where many brave individuals sacrificed their lives for the cause of Korean independence and democracy.",

In his youth he studied philosophy under Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger before emigrating to Montreal where he became a professor of sociology at McGill University. His work on liberation theology led him into conflict with the Vatican during the Second Vatican Council. After being excommunicated by Pope Paul VI for supporting ordination of women priests, he returned to the Church after John Paul II lifted the sanction against him.\n>\n> ## Early life[edit]\n>\n> Born in Vienna, Austria, Baum grew up in a secular home. At age 14, he began attending Mass regularly and soon thereafter decided to convert to Christianity. He chose Catholicism over Protestantism because it had more sacraments and rituals that appealed to him. When he told his father about this decision, his father responded, \"You are not going to become a Christian.\"^{[2]} However, when Baum turned sixteen, he went ahead with his conversion anyway. This caused a rift between himself and his family; they did not speak to each other again until after World War II ended.^{[3]}\n>\n> ## Education[edit]\n>\n> Baum attended high school in Vienna and then moved to Paris to study philosophy under Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger.

    "The following information was archived as of November 2013—the same month that David Zimmer (then known legally by his birth name David Singer) resigned in disgrace after a judge refused to stay enforcement of her May order, which was based on evidence provided at trial and her decision on the matter.[4] At that time, many commentators assumed he would seek to have his original sentence overturned on appeal. His subsequent disappearance into hiding for several months, before resigning from every position he formerly held or had created within the party, has led some observers to speculate whether this course of action might not occur if a new court hearing took place (for instance under a different Judge), due to legal uncertainty about how such a case could be adjudicated without the prior Court finding being stayed pending the outcome of Zimmer’s own appeals process with respect to those charges against him related to alleged election violations during municipal contests between himselfandhis opponent(s).

It can refer literally ('urban') or metaphorically (by way of urbanisation), which means it applies not only to the cities themselves but also their outskirts.[1][2] As for 'pop', UPC is also a kind of popular phenomenon[3], which in many cases also happens to be media-associated[4]. For example while its original forms are quite old fashioned nowadays they still retain a great deal of interest among those interested more in traditional values than new trends (e.g.'street art').

    "The term transatlantic relations refers to the relationship between North America and Europe, particularly the United States and Canada on one side and Western European countries (and sometimes Russia) on the other. Transatlantic relations are often considered in terms of political, economic or cultural ties. In recent years, however, they have also been discussed with regard to security issues such as terrorism and energy policy.\n\n## History[edit]\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\nIn 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed west across the Atlantic Ocean for Spain, hoping to find a new route to Asia. He landed instead in what he thought was India but which turned out to be the Bahamas. His voyage marked the beginning of regular contact between Europeans and Native Americans. It took another century before permanent settlements were established by Europeans in the Americas.\n\nEuropean colonization of the New World began when Spanish explorers arrived at present-day Florida in 1565. France followed suit soon after, establishing its first colony in Quebec City in 1608. England's Jamestown Colony was founded two years later. These three nations would go on to become major players in shaping early American politics and culture. Other European powers including Portugal, Sweden, Denmark/Norway, Netherlands, Germany and Russia all had brief periods of involvement in North America during this time period. However, it wasn't until the late 17th century that these countries started sending large numbers of settlers over to their respective colonies. By then most of them had already lost interest due to financial difficulties back home or because they found better opportunities elsewhere like Africa or South America.\n\nDuring this same period there were several attempts made by various groups within each country to establish independent republics within their own borders. Some succeeded while others failed miserably. One notable example being the Republic of Texas which lasted only four months before being absorbed into Mexico again. Another interesting case study involves Vermont which declared itself an independent nation under British rule prior to becoming part of the United States. This move proved unpopular among many residents who preferred remaining loyal subjects of King George III rather than risking war against him. As a result Vermonters eventually decided to join forces with Massachusetts Bay Colony instead thus ending any chance they might have had at",

    "Mahalakshmi (also spelled as Laxmi) is a Hindu goddess, who symbolizes wealth and prosperity. She is also known by other names such as Sri, Shree or Bhoodevi. In her benevolent form she is called Santana Lakshmi, which means 'Lakshmi bestowing children'. Her name comes from two Sanskrit words - laksya meaning aim and ami meaning I. Thus, Lakshmi literally translates to 'the goal' or 'that towards which one strives.'\n\nIn Hinduism, Lakshmi is considered the consort of Vishnu, the preserver in the Trimurti. As his shakti, she represents the feminine energy that pervades all creation. She is often depicted with four arms holding lotus flowers, mace, chamara and alms bowl. She rides on a lotus flower or owl.\n\nThe worship of Lakshmi has been prevalent since ancient times. Many temples are dedicated to her throughout India. Some of these include the Ekambareswarar Temple at Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu; the Lakshminarayan temple at Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh; the Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple at Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh; the Lakshmi Devi Temple at Khajuraho, Madhya Pradesh; the Lakshmi-Narasimha Temple at Ahobilam, Andhra Pradesh; the Lakshmi-Narasimha Temple at Melkote, Karnataka; the Lakshmi-Narasimha Temple at Simhachalam near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh; the Lakshmi-Narasimha Temple at Yadagirigutta, Telangana; the Lakshmi-Narasimha Temple at Thirukannapuram, Tamil Nadu; the Lakshmi-Narasimha Temple at Mundeshwari, Jharkhand; the Lakshmi-Narasimha Temple at",

    "(Redirected from Atlantic deciduous forest)\nThe eastern North American temperate broadleaf and mixed forests are a large ecoregion, occupying the northeast section of North America from Quebec to Florida. To emphasize geographic boundaries, this article uses the term \"eastern temperate forest\" as it appears in Wikipedia's broader article on woodlands and forest biomes; however, more recently, scholars have redefined the terms associated with U.S. vegetation by creating plant associations that cover several states.[1] In Canada these regions are collectively known by its common name (Boreal Shield), reflecting its history.\nThese forests exist along the transitional climatic gradient between the Great Plains climate zone to the west and Maritime provinces of Southeastern Canada climate zone[2] to the east. Forests can be divided into two primary types: Southern Oak-Chestnut forest and Northern White Cedar-Hemlock-Pine forest, although there are numerous subtypes each adapted for local conditions based upon soil type, topography and moisture availability.[3][4] Coniferous trees account for approximately 50% of all tree species within the Eastern Temperate Deciduous Forest. Pines account for over half of conifers present.[5] Due to a variety of factors such as fire and flooding, there is tremendous variation across the region as opposed to some ecological groups where similar or higher amounts of diversity may have only subtle differences among species populations when compared side by side; one location in a particular state could contain oak, hickory, ash, sugar maple and hemlock while another might replace pine for ash or elm instead. There has been debate over which part of the Northeast United States represents true boreal forest, with evidence suggesting that Maine should not be classified as such due to its southerly placement relative too much larger parts found throughout northwestern Quebec province[6]. It would take millions years before these areas regrow if cut down entirely now because many native plants/animals cannot tolerate cooler winters experienced further south near Atlantic coastline making any attempt impossible without importing foreign organisms into habitat unsuited their natural needs resulting disastrous consequences potentially fatal even smaller creatures like insect larvae unable survive freezing winter storms",

    "## History[edit]\n\nThe Klamath Indians were among the first Native Americans to encounter European explorers and settlers in what would become Oregon. They lived along the lower reaches of the Klamath River for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans.^{[1]} In 1853, a treaty was signed with the United States government that ceded most of their land to the U.S., but it was never ratified by Congress. After the discovery of gold in northern California in 1849, many miners came through the area on their way north. Many stayed and settled there permanently. By 1860, the population had grown enough to warrant the creation of Klamath County. It was named after the river which flows through its center.\n\nIn 1872, the county seat was moved from Weitchpec (now called Requa) to Yreka. This move was controversial at the time because the new location was far away from the majority of residents who lived near the coast. However, the town of Yreka grew rapidly as more people arrived seeking gold and other opportunities. Today, Yreka remains the largest city in Klamath County and serves as its economic hub.\n\nDuring World War II, several military bases were built in Klamath County to support American troops fighting overseas. These included Camp White (later renamed Fort Lewis), Camp Adair (renamed Camp Riley), and Camp Myles Standish (renamed Camp Pendleton). After the war ended, these facilities were closed down or converted into civilian uses such as housing developments or parks.\n\nToday, Klamath County continues to be home to many different industries including agriculture, forestry, mining, tourism, manufacturing, retail trade, health care services, education institutions, etc.. Its economy has diversified over time due largely to changes brought about by technological advances like computers/internet accessibility; however, some traditional businesses still exist here too! For example: logging companies continue operating despite declining timber harvests while farmers grow crops using modern techniques instead of relying solely upon rainfall alone...\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,55",

He died in Tel Aviv [at] age 80.\n\nAlthough generally acknowledged as a great scholar of unsurpassable breadth and depth, Hanoch Albeck nevertheless failed to attract wide popularity among academic students and other readers. In part this was due to the difficulty or ponderousness of style of his works, which often read like complex essays rather than expositions by someone capable of simplifying difficult material. Also responsible may have been his tendency not only to reject established scholarly consensus where it conflicted with facts cited by him, but even to disparage views that differed sharply from those favored by him without offering solid proof against acceptance.[3][4]. Still, despite his detractors, many regard[5] or believe[3] Albeck to be one of the most important figures in Jewish scholarship of modern times. He has no real successor among Israeli academics in biblical and rabbinic fields. For years thereafter few Israelis took to seriously confronting ancient texts. The situation changed in recent decades when the Hebrew language became enmeshed in various linguistic sciences such as semiotics and discourse analysis.\"",

It first aired on August 12, 2011.\n\n## Plot:\n\nAt a dinner party held by the Mafuyu (Mitsuba) family, Hayate, Haku, and Nagi were having discussions about the fact that Hitsuji is dating Seta Sougorou, Nagi is now dating Rinko, Hayate is dating Ayumu, and the fact that Hayate has been helping Yukiji with her love life for free even though she has the money, and Yukiji and Hitsuji have gotten much older. Nagi is confused as to what exactly she wants to do for Hitsuji's birthday, but then Hina suggests to give her some money as her birthday present. This causes Nagi and Haku to go off together to go shopping. Hayate overhears this discussion and asks to join, as he doesn't like being left out of the party.\n\nThey later go into a book store with Haku and buy a book for Hitsuji that was originally a love letter from someone to his lover. Hayate was surprised at the fact that you could write a love letter but then turned it into a novel instead, and he decided to buy a copy of the book instead to give to Hitsuji to read in the hopes of making her cry. They later continued to a restaurant called the Royal Palace, but the food there was terrible (according to Hayate) so they decided to just have ice cream and pizza instead.

He was also a collector of art and culture from the Himalayan region.\n>\n> René was born on 6 July 1908 into one of the oldest aristocratic families of Austria, the house of de Nebesky-Wojkowitz, who are described by Reginald Reynolds in his biography of René. He studied in Oxford, England until 1920. He obtained the title of Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Vienna in 1936.\n>\n> He became interested in Tibetan language, literature, religion and folklore in his youth. The reason for this interest was the close friendship between his father, who died when René was only six years old, and his father's friend, the famous English adventurer Colonel Francis Younghusband, the explorer of the Tibetan plateau, who encouraged his interest. He was invited to meet Younghusband, and to visit Tibet.\n>\n> René studied at the German Tibet Institute of the University of Bonn.

    "Transitional bilingualism refers to the process by which an individual learns and uses two or more languages in a sequential manner. This typically occurs when a person moves from one language environment to another, either due to migration or other reasons, and must adapt to the new linguistic community. In this context, transitional bilingualism is distinct from simultaneous bilingualism, where individuals are exposed to both languages at the same time from birth, resulting in a different pattern of language acquisition and use.\n\nThe process of transitional bilingualism can occur at any age, but it is most commonly associated with childhood. When children move between languages, they often experience a period of confusion and disorientation as they struggle to make sense of the new linguistic system. However, research has shown that children who are exposed to multiple languages during this critical period of brain development are actually better able to acquire and maintain all of the languages involved.\n\nOne key factor in successful transitional bilingualism is the child's level of exposure to each language. Ideally, children should be surrounded by native speakers of both languages and have ample opportunities to practice speaking and listening in each language on a regular basis. Additionally, parents and caregivers can play an important role in supporting the child's language learning by providing consistent and positive reinforcement for their efforts.\n\nDespite the many benefits of transitional bilingualism, there are also potential challenges that may arise. For example, some children may develop language mixing or code-switching, where they combine elements of both languages in their speech. While this can be a natural part of the language learning process, it can also lead to difficulties in communicating effectively with monolinguals or in maintaining proficiency in either language. To address these issues, it is important for children to receive guidance and support from adults who are familiar with both languages and can help them to develop clear and accurate communication skills in each language.\n\nOverall, transitional bilingualism is a complex and dynamic process that involves adapting to new linguistic environments and developing the ability to communicate effectively in multiple languages. With appropriate support and resources, children who grow up in transitional bilingual settings can reap numerous cognitive, social, and cultural benefits that will serve them well throughout their lives.",

    "A unilateral policy is a policy that is implemented by a single entity, such as a government or organization, without the involvement or consent of other parties. This type of policy can be controversial, as it may not take into account the needs or interests of other stakeholders.\n\nOne example of a unilateral policy is a trade embargo, which is a policy that prohibits or limits trade with a particular country. This type of policy is often used as a way to apply economic pressure to a country, with the aim of bringing about political or economic change. However, it can also have negative consequences for the country being embargoed, as it can limit access to goods and services that are essential for its survival.\n\nAnother example of a unilateral policy is a policy of military intervention. This can involve the use of force to achieve a particular goal, such as overthrowing a government or protecting civilian populations. Military intervention can be controversial, as it may not always be effective and can have unintended consequences.\n\nOverall, unilateral policies can be effective in achieving certain goals, but they are often controversial and may not always be the best course of action. It is important for any entity that implements unilateral policies to carefully consider the potential consequences and to take steps to minimize any negative impacts.",

    "Cornelis Johannes Gerardus Verwoerd (28 August 1906 – 30 April 1966), known as Con vander Merwe or Kobie, was a South African politician from the National Party and the third State President of South Africa. The Dutch Reformed Church bishop J. G. Strijker ordained him as an elderly man before his death, making him one of only two men to hold both positions in the history of the country.\n\nVerwoerd grew up on his family farm near Lyndenburg, Transvaal Colony, as one of four sons born to Abraham Willem Jacobus Verwoerd, who served as Prime Minister in 1945, and Adriana Hendrina Johanna Vlok. After attending HBS Middelschool Uitgeest, Verwoord studied at Voortrekkerbosch Teachers' Training College in Cape Town before taking a degree in agriculture at the University of Pretoria in 1927.\n\nReturning home after graduation, he taught for some time before joining his father's government. While serving as private secretary in the Department of Education, he took charge of administering Afrikaans schools following the 1948 Volkskraal, which saw the party win the majority in that year's general election and form the first Government under the apartheid system. He is credited with implementing policies that significantly increased funding for and standardised many Afrikaans-medium schools.\n\nDuring this period, Verwoerd became increasingly convinced of the need for racial separation between blacks and whites, proposing an education policy known as separate development. This proposed dividing black education into Bantu language \"homelands\" rather than providing them with opportunities for integration into mainstream society. These ideas would later become central to apartheid policy during his presidency.\n\nLater, as Prime Minister, Verwoerd played a key role in the Sharpeville massacre in March 1960 when security forces killed over 180 protesters protesting against the jailing of activist Nelson Mandela. In May 1961, tensions escalating between the ruling National Party government and the African National Congress erupted into fullscale",
    "Enamelin (also known as enamel protein) is a protein found in the enamel of teeth. It is a member of the family of proteins known as the enamelins, which also includes amelogenin and ameloblastin. Enamelin is synthesized by ameloblasts, the cells that produce enamel, and is incorporated into the enamel matrix during the process of enamel formation.\n\nEnamelin is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 54 kDa. It consists of two repeating domains, each of which is responsible for the formation of a specific type of hydrogen bond. These hydrogen bonds are responsible for the high strength and durability of enamel. Enamelin also contains several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and glycosylation, which are important for the proper functioning of the protein.\n\nThe role of enamelin in enamel formation is not fully understood, but it is believed to play a critical role in the organization of the enamel matrix. Enamelin is thought to interact with other proteins and minerals in the matrix, helping to form the complex network of hydrogen bonds that give enamel its strength and durability.\n\nEnamelin is also involved in the process of tooth erosion. When the enamel on the teeth is exposed to acid, enamelin can undergo a process of degradation, which can lead to the loss of enamel and increased susceptibility to further erosion.\n\nIn summary, enamelin is a protein found in the enamel of teeth that plays a critical role in the formation and organization of the enamel matrix. It is also involved in the process of tooth erosion. Further research is needed to fully understand the function of enamelin and its role in oral health.",

Both sides were attempting to lure the other into a larger battle.\n\nIn the early stages of the battle, several naval groups on both sides became separated, leading to confusion and delays. At one point, Jellicoe's flagship, HMS Iron Duke, was attacked by several German torpedo boats, but was able to evade their attacks.\n\nAs the battle progressed, reinforcements arrived on both sides, and the fighting became more intense. Late in the afternoon, the German forces launched a massive torpedo attack on the British navy, which were able to defend themselves against the majority of the attacks.\n\nThe battle ended in a victory for the British forces, although the German forces suffered fewer casualties and were able to retire to port. The battle was considered a success for the German forces, as they had been able to inflict the most damage on the British navy.\n\nOverall, the Battle of Jutland was a significant naval battle of World War I, and demonstrated the importance of naval warfare in the conflict. The battle also had a significant impact on the outcome of the war, as it forced the German navy to retreat to port, leaving the British with domination of the seas in the North Sea.",

    "Italianate architecture is an architectural style that emerged in Northern Italy during the Renaissance and subsequently spread throughout Europe. It is characterized by symmetrical facades, steeply pitched roofs, large windows with flat arches, classical orders, pilasters, pediments and entablatures.\n\nThe style originated in the city of Florence in the 14th and 15th centuries, where Romanesque houses were renovated to give them a more modern look. This new style was called \"Florentine\" or \"renaissance,\" meaning \"rebirth.\" In the early 20th century, it became popular again, especially in America, and was often used for urban planning.\n\nIts use can be seen at the University of Bologna, where its iconic Library Archiginnasio building features elements of this revivalist style. The exterior has tall columns with pedimental crowns and a clock tower with four faces and bronze bells. Other notable examples include Statoil House in Norway and Palazzo Molteni in London.\n\nThis architectural trend continued into the Baroque period, when other decorative elements such as curved balustrades, domed ceilings, cornices, and illusionistic frescoes were added to make buildings even more grandiose.\n\nIn summary, Italianate architecture is a historical style that emerged in Northern Italy during the Renaissance and evolved over time until it reached its peak in the Baroque era. Its main characteristics are symmetrical facades, steeply pitched roofs, large windows with complex arches and intricate stonework, drawing inspiration from ancient Roman architecture.",

    "Edward Blum is an American litigant known for filing high-profile cases in the United States that have affected issues such as voting rights, school prayer, and affirmative action. He has been involved in several landmark legal battles, including Shelby County v. Holder and Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin.\n\nIn 2013, Blum filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice challenging Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, arguing that it unfairly targeted states with largely white voter rolls which were not experiencing widespread voter discrimination. The case was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, ruling in Blum's favor and striking down the section.\n\nBlum also challenged the constitutionality of affirmative action policies in higher education through the Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin case. In this case, he argued on behalf of Abigail Fisher, who had applied to the university but was denied admission due to her race. After going through multiple appeals, the Supreme Court upheld UT's admissions policy in its 2016 decision, finding it did not discriminate against non-Hispanic applicants. However, in June 2020, the court ruled in two other affirmative action cases that universities may need to be more transparent about their criteria and be forced to consider individual students rather than racial or ethnic groups.\n\nMost recently, Blum has filed another legal challenge titled Espinoza v. Torres Ramirez, where he seeks to eliminate the requirement that religious institutions must receive federal funds in order to participate government programs. This case challenges California’s AB 844, which prevents religious schools from applying for state education grants or receiving taxpayer money towards facility modernization or repair costs unless they allow all enrolled students regardless of religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, and national origin to partake in any course or program offered.\n\nOverall, Edward Blum's legal activism has consistently sought to advocate for equal treatment under the law without regard to race or gender, drawing criticism from some groups as disruptive to longstanding social justice initiatives.",

    "Forensic entomology is the application of scientific knowledge of insects to the investigation of crimes, especially those involving death. It is a subfield of forensic science and entomology, the study of insects. Forensic entomologists use insects as biological indicators to help determine the time of death of a deceased person, the cause of death, and the identity of the victim.\n\nInsects are attracted to decomposing organic matter, and their life cycles are closely tied to the decomposition process. By studying the species, stage, and abundance of insects found on or near a body, forensic entomologists can provide valuable information about the time of death. For example, the presence of maggots indicates that decomposition has begun, and the type of maggot can help determine the time of death.\n\nForensic entomologists can also use insects to help determine the cause of death. For example, the presence of certain insects, such as blowflies, can indicate that the victim died from asphyxiation, while the presence of certain beetles can indicate that the victim died from ingesting poison.\n\nIn addition to providing information about the time of death and the cause of death, forensic entomologists can also use insects to help identify the victim. Insects are attracted to certain types of bodies, and the species and abundance of insects found on a body can help identify the victim. For example, the presence of certain types of beetles can indicate that the victim was a farmer or a person who worked with livestock.\n\nForensic entomology is a relatively new field, and it is still being developed. However, it has already proven to be a valuable tool in the investigation of crimes involving death. Forensic entomologists work closely with other forensic scientists, such as pathologists and odontologists, to provide a complete picture of the death and the victim.",
    "Sociocultural evolution is the gradual process by which human societies change over time due to various internal and external factors. This concept was first introduced by anthropologist Edward Tylor, who proposed that cultures evolve through an accumulation of knowledge, technology, customs, and institutions.\n\nThere are several key models used to understand sociocultural evolution:\n\n1. Modernization theory: This model posits that societies become more complex and modern over time as they adopt new technologies, values, and practices from more advanced societies. It suggests that cultural change is driven primarily by economic growth and development.\n2. Functionalism: According to functionalist theory, every aspect of culture serves a specific purpose in maintaining social order and cohesion. Therefore, changes in culture must be understood within their broader role in supporting the functioning of society.\n3. Conflict theory: This approach emphasizes the role of power imbalances and conflict in shaping social change. Social movements and activism can drive cultural transformations by challenging prevailing power structures and creating opportunities for marginalized groups to gain greater representation and agency.\n4. Network analysis: By studying relationships between people, organizations, and ideas, network analysts identify patterns of influence and diffusion that shape cultural evolution. This approach highlights how ideas travel across networks, sometimes via formal channels like markets or religions, and other times through informal connections among friends, family members, or colleagues.\n5. Agent-based modeling: This computational method simulates individual agents interacting with one another over time to study emergent behaviors at various scales, including those related to sociocultural evolution. Agent-based simulations allow researchers to test alternative hypotheses about how cultural traits spread and adapt under different conditions.\n6. Cultural materialism: Anthony Giddens's theory proposes that cultural change arises out of contradictions within social systems, particularly those related to production and reproduction. His work stresses that cultural transformation often occurs when existing modes of societal organization break down or encounter limits.\n7. Symbolic interactionism: Founded by Max Weber",

    "\"The original, though now somewhat uncommon, method of vibration cooking involved the use of two sheets of metal connected by an electromagnet, which generates energy through electromagnetic induction. By cooking a metal container of food which contains a metal object, the magnet could vibrate the container over a hot flame. A more modern method uses a device similar to a stove top, but with a magnetic metal plate which absorbs energy through induction. This method is preferred to the original, because in the original, induction can only occur through contact with the metal plate — when the container is moved, the object contained within cannot, and must still be heated by contact.\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, a variety of companies marketed a vibration cooking device that consisted of two metal plates connected by a series of magnets which vibrated at ultrasonic frequencies. An electrically conductive vessel, usually of aluminum, was placed between the plates, which caused energy to be induced into the vessel by inductive heating. This method was promoted for its ability to \"cook faster and healthier.\"\nThe FDA evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the device and concluded in August 2003 that the device has no significant benefit over conventional cooking methods.\"[3] This finding followed an earlier review conducted in 1999, shortly after the device was first marketed. The FDA's 1999 report states in part, \"... FDA conducted a literature search to determine the scientific validity of the benefits claimed for ultrasonic vibration cooking. Our search revealed no evidence... demonstrating that these [or any other] alternative cooking claims... are scientifically valid\"[4]\nThe following text is the full text of an article titled \"Transonic flight\" from wikipedia.com:\n\"Transonic flight, sometimes called supercritical aerodynamics, is the flight regime of an aircraft whose current velocity lies in between the Mach number and sound speed (Mach 1.0 and the speed of sound), where sonic effects influence flight dynamics beyond the Mach disc. [.....]\nFlight at transonic speeds poses challenges to aircraft design. To control shocks effectively, designers can shape the wings (using techniques that involve moving the shock waves away from the wing's leading edge) and can equip the airframe with shock absorbers to dissipate the energy of the shock without damaging the aircraft. The NASA X-43 hypersonic research aircraft took this approach by using control surfaces designed to change the angle of attack, which allowed the shock wave to dissipate",

    "Peter Fredrik Schmeichel (Danish: [ˈpæˀteː ˈˌskmæicəl]; born 5 January 1963) is a former Danish footballer who played as a goalkeeper. Born in Gladsaxe, Schmeichel made his debut with Hvidovre IF at the advanced age of twenty-six and was the starting goalkeeper for the Danish national team for over a decade, winning the 1992 European Footballer of the Year award. He spent the bulk of his career playing with several top European clubs and is the current goalkeeping coach for Fulham.\nA product of the Brøndby IF academy, Schmeichel played for various teams in the lower tiers of Danish football until 1988, but did not see a single league action for Brøndby until 1990. He was soon sold on to Manchester United, in time to win the 1991 FA Cup. He helped United win the Premier League in 1993 and 1994, the FA Cup in 1994 and 1995, and the FA Community Shield in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994. In 1997, he left to play for A.C. Milan before moving on to Sporting CP and Manchester City in 2000 and 2006, respectively. In his second stint at City, he won the Football League Cup and made it to a League Cup final with Sunderland in 2009. He continued his career in the US, playing for LA Galaxy and Toronto from 2009 until 2010. He returned to Manchester City as a goalkeeping coach in late 2010; he has also played as a goalkeeper in the Danish Superliga, the English Premier League and the Football League Championship until 2010.\nSchmeichel started his football career with Brøndby IF's youth academy in 1977, but did not make his senior debut until 1988. His first appearance in \"the orange\" was on 18 June 1988 against SønderjyskE where he was subbed in just past the half-way mark. In the four season from 1988 to 1992 he only saw four league games. His first league goal came on 31 May 1992 against Randers Freja, although he conceded five other goals.\nOn 10 August 1990, with Brøndby facing liquidation, he joined Manchester United for a reported fee of £1.2million. This would change Schmeichel's fortunes",

    "Habib Bourguiba (Arabic: حبيب بورقيبة‎, IPA: [ħabiːb burˈqijba]) (11 January 1903 – 6 April 2000) was a Tunisian politician and statesman who served as the first President of Tunisia, from 1957 until 1987, as well as leader of the Neo Destour political party that later ruled the country. Upon independence in 1956, he was chosen as the first president of Tunisia and led the new country to one-party rule. He was credited with establishing an independent legal system for the new nation and in the late 1960s also promoted Islamic values in order to strengthen his position. He was ousted in a 1987 coup d'état after a twenty-one-year rule.\nHabib Bourguiba at age five.\nHabib Bourguiba was born in Métouia, in the region of Tunis. His father was Abu-Bekr Ben Abdallah, a Tunisian farmer, and his mother was a woman from the local area named Zohra. Bourguiba lived in a small village known as Sidi Kharraz. Although not from the family of Arab slave origin, the Bourguiba family is seen as one from Berber descent. There were five other children besides Bourguiba: a younger brother, Ahmed, and a younger sister, Fatma. His older brother Mohamed was assassinated by a French Army officer in the streets of Métouia.\nIn addition to his Islamic studies, Bourguiba attended the French lycée in El Kef, Tunisia, and in 1921 entered the University of Carthage Law School in Tunis. He was educated in the principles of European democracy by a French lawyer friend, and studied jurisprudence under a French professor, Pierre Gaudant, who also taught Habib Abdelaziz, the future prime minister of Tunisia.\nBourguiba was an opponent of the French colonisation of his country, which began in 1881 and reached a peak after the conquest of southern Tunisia in 1881. A nationalist movement was formed in Tunisia to oppose colonisation, and Bourguiba joined it in 1936 when he formed the Neoproudhonist Marxist group, a Tunisian section of the International Revolutionary",
    "Deglaciation\nOne result of deglaciation is that formerly subglacial water now resides in the terrestrial environment. These waters constitute a potential source of fresh water in areas close to glaciers and ice sheets, and also contribute to the ocean surface freshwater budget in regions as far as Antarctica. For example, the Greenland ice sheet is the largest single contributor to sea-level rise, because of its large surface area and slow response to environmental change.\nIn addition to the above changes to the freshwater cycle, deglaciation affects weather patterns in some regions, particularly in northern Europe and North America. As glaciers withdraw, atmospheric pressure increases in some regions due to removal of the weight of the ice. An example is \"glacier fever\" or \"glacier flu\", which has been attributed to the abrupt and large-scale loss of glacial ice. At the same time, an increase of cloud cover and precipitation may occur, with the rain carrying high amounts of the suspended glacial dust which is carried down into the lowlands and deposited by the rain.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nGlaciology\nPaleoclimatology\nIce ages",

The Botswanan government subsequently adopted a policy of seeking balanced development assistance from multiple partners,[5] and the PRC has largely refrained from overt interference in Botswana's internal affairs.[6] Development assistance from China is more in the form of infrastructure and investment, rather than humanitarian aid.[7][5]\n\nInfrastructure construction has formed the bulk of the PRC's economic and commercial investment in the country, which amounted to $100 million in the three years leading up to 2005.[8][7] The bilateral trade agreement reached during Chinese leader Hu Jintao's state visit in 2005 committed China to providing more than $350 million in loan financing for a planned railway,",

It has been shown recently however,[by whom?][whence?, where what was cited needs clarification – discuss ]that it also plays important roles during apoptosis through its interaction with Bid protein via N terminal domain binding site on Ipakcβ isoform.

In 1612, he joined the Muscovy Company, a British trade corporation that had a monopoly on English trade with Russia. Over the next several years, he made several trips to the Russian city of Archangel, where he engaged in trade and negotiated with local officials on behalf of the company.\n\nIn 1618, Frere became involved in the founding of the English colony of Connecticut, which was established by a group of Puritan settlers led by the Rev. Thomas Hooker. Frere provided financial support for the colony and helped to secure land for the settlers from the local Native American tribes. He also served as a member of the colony's governing council for several years.\n\nIn addition to his work in Connecticut, Frere continued to engage in trade with Russia, and in 1633 he led an expedition to explore the eastern coast of Siberia. Unfortunately, the expedition was plagued by difficulties, and Frere and his crew were forced to abandon their ships and undergo a dangerous overland journey to reach safety. Frere died the following year during a return voyage to England.\n\nFrere's contributions to English exploration and commerce were significant, and his legacy continues to be celebrated in his native England as well as in the United States.
