    "The brave Geraint, a knight of Arthur's court,\nA tributary prince of Devon, one\nOf that great Order of the Table Round,\nHad married Enid, Yniol's only child,\nAnd loved her, as he loved the light of Heaven.\nAnd as the light of Heaven varies, now\nAt sunrise, now at sunset, now by night\nWith moon and trembling stars, so loved Geraint\nTo make her beauty vary day by day,\nIn crimsons and in purples and in gems.\nAnd Enid, but to please her husband's eye,\nWho first had found and loved her in a state\nOf broken fortunes, daily fronted him\nIn some fresh splendour; and the Queen herself,\nGrateful to Prince Geraint for service done,\nLoved her, and often with her own white hands\nArrayed and decked her, as the loveliest,\nNext after her own self, in all the court.\nAnd Enid loved the Queen, and with true heart\nAdored her, as the stateliest and the best\nAnd loveliest of all women upon earth.\nAnd seeing them so tender and so close,\nLong in their common love rejoiced Geraint.\nBut when a rumour rose about the Queen,\nTouching her guilty love for Lancelot,\nThough yet there lived no proof, nor yet was heard\nThe world's loud whisper breaking into storm,\nNot less Geraint believed it; and there fell\nA horror on him, lest his gentle wife,\nThrough that great tenderness for Guinevere,\nHad suffered, or should suffer any taint\nIn nature:  wherefore going to the King,\nHe made this pretext, that his princedom lay\nClose on the borders of a territory,\nWherein were bandit earls, and caitiff knights,\nAssassins, and all flyers from the hand\nOf Justice, and whatever loathes a law:\nAnd therefore, till the King himself should please\nTo cleanse this common sewer of all his realm,\nHe craved a fair permission to depart,\nAnd there defend his marches; and the King\nMused for a little on his plea, but, last,\nAllowing it, the Prince and Enid rode,\nAnd fifty knights rode with them, to the shores\nOf Severn, and they past to their own land;\nWhere, thinking, that if ever yet was wife\nTrue to her lord, mine shall be so to me,\nHe compassed her with sweet observances\nAnd worship, never leaving her, and grew\nForgetful of his promise to the King,\nForgetful of the falcon and the hunt,\nForgetful of the tilt and tournament,\nForgetful of his glory and his name,\nForgetful of his princedom and its cares.\nAnd this forgetfulness was hateful to her.\nAnd by and by the people, when they met\nIn twos and threes, or fuller companies,\nBegan to scoff and jeer and babble of him\nAs of a prince whose manhood was all gone,\nAnd molten down in mere uxoriousness.\nAnd this she gathered from the people's eyes:\nThis too the women who attired her head,\nTo please her, dwelling on his boundless love,\nTold Enid, and they saddened her the more:\nAnd day by day she thought to tell Geraint,\nBut could not out of bashful delicacy;\nWhile he that watched her sadden, was the more\nSuspicious that her nature had a taint.\nAt last, it chanced that on a summer morn\n(They sleeping each by either) the new sun\nBeat through the blindless casement of the room,\nAnd heated the strong warrior in his dreams;\nWho, moving, cast the coverlet aside,\nAnd bared the knotted column of his throat,\nThe massive square of his heroic breast,\nAnd arms on which the standing muscle sloped,\nAs slopes a wild brook o'er a little stone,\nRunning too vehemently to break upon it.\nAnd Enid woke and sat beside the couch,\nAdmiring him, and thought within herself,\nWas ever man so grandly made as he?\nThen, like a shadow, past the people's talk\nAnd accusation of uxoriousness\nAcross her mind, and bowing over him,\nLow to her own heart piteously she said:\n'O noble breast and all-puissant arms,\nAm I the cause, I the poor cause that men\nReproach you, saying all your force is gone?\nI AM the cause, because I dare not speak\nAnd tell him what I think and what they say.\nAnd yet I hate that he should linger here;\nI cannot love my lord and not his name.\nFar liefer had I gird his harness on him,\nAnd ride with him to battle and stand by,\nAnd watch his mightful hand striking great blows\nAt caitiffs and at wrongers of the world.\nFar better were I laid in the dark earth,\nNot hearing any more his noble voice,\nNot to be folded more in these dear arms,\nAnd darkened from the high light in his eyes,\nThan that my lord through me should suffer shame.\nAm I so bold, and could I so stand by,\nAnd see my dear lord wounded in the strife,\nAnd maybe pierced to death before mine eyes,\nAnd yet not dare to tell him what I think,\nAnd how men slur him, saying all his force\nIs melted into mere effeminacy?\nO me, I fear that I am no true wife.'\nHalf inwardly, half audibly she spoke,\nAnd the strong passion in her made her weep\nTrue tears upon his broad and naked breast,\nAnd these awoke him, and by great mischance\nHe heard but fragments of her later words,\nAnd that she feared she was not a true wife.\nAnd then he thought, 'In spite of all my care,\nFor all my pains, poor man, for all my pains,\nShe is not faithful to me, and I see her\nWeeping for some gay knight in Arthur's hall.'\nThen though he loved and reverenced her too much\nTo dream she could be guilty of foul act,\nRight through his manful breast darted the pang\nThat makes a man, in the sweet face of her\nWhom he loves most, lonely and miserable.\nAt this he hurled his huge limbs out of bed,\nAnd shook his drowsy squire awake and cried,\n'My charger and her palfrey;' then to her,\n'I will ride forth into the wilderness;\nFor though it seems my spurs are yet to win,\nI have not fallen so low as some would wish.\nAnd thou, put on thy worst and meanest dress\nAnd ride with me.'  And Enid asked, amazed,\n'If Enid errs, let Enid learn her fault.'\nBut he, 'I charge thee, ask not, but obey.'\nThen she bethought her of a faded silk,\nA faded mantle and a faded veil,\nAnd moving toward a cedarn cabinet,\nWherein she kept them folded reverently\nWith sprigs of summer laid between the folds,\nShe took them, and arrayed herself therein,\nRemembering when first he came on her\nDrest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,\nAnd all her foolish fears about the dress,\nAnd all his journey to her, as himself\nHad told her, and their coming to the court.\nFor Arthur on the Whitsuntide before\nHeld court at old Caerleon upon Usk.\nThere on a day, he sitting high in hall,\nBefore him came a forester of Dean,\nWet from the woods, with notice of a hart\nTaller than all his fellows, milky-white,\nFirst seen that day:  these things he told the King.\nThen the good King gave order to let blow\nHis horns for hunting on the morrow morn.\nAnd when the King petitioned for his leave\nTo see the hunt, allowed it easily.\nSo with the morning all the court were gone.\nBut Guinevere lay late into the morn,\nLost in sweet dreams, and dreaming of her love\nFor Lancelot, and forgetful of the hunt;\nBut rose at last, a single maiden with her,\nTook horse, and forded Usk, and gained the wood;\nThere, on a little knoll beside it, stayed\nWaiting to hear the hounds; but heard instead\nA sudden sound of hoofs, for Prince Geraint,\nLate also, wearing neither hunting-dress\nNor weapon, save a golden-hilted brand,\nCame quickly flashing through the shallow ford\nBehind them, and so galloped up the knoll.\nA purple scarf, at either end whereof\nThere swung an apple of the purest gold,\nSwayed round about him, as he galloped up\nTo join them, glancing like a dragon-fly\nIn summer suit and silks of holiday.\nLow bowed the tributary Prince, and she,\nSweet and statelily, and with all grace\nOf womanhood and queenhood, answered him:\n'Late, late, Sir Prince,' she said, 'later than we!'\n'Yea, noble Queen,' he answered, 'and so late\nThat I but come like you to see the hunt,\nNot join it.'  'Therefore wait with me,' she said;\n'For on this little knoll, if anywhere,\nThere is good chance that we shall hear the hounds:\nHere often they break covert at our feet.'\nAnd while they listened for the distant hunt,\nAnd chiefly for the baying of Cavall,\nKing Arthur's hound of deepest mouth, there rode\nFull slowly by a knight, lady, and dwarf;\nWhereof the dwarf lagged latest, and the knight\nHad vizor up, and showed a youthful face,\nImperious, and of haughtiest lineaments.\nAnd Guinevere, not mindful of his face\nIn the King's hall, desired his name, and sent\nHer maiden to demand it of the dwarf;\nWho being vicious, old and irritable,\nAnd doubling all his master's vice of pride,\nMade answer sharply that she should not know.\n'Then will I ask it of himself,' she said.\n'Nay, by my faith, thou shalt not,' cried the dwarf;\n'Thou art not worthy even to speak of him;'\nAnd when she put her horse toward the knight,\nStruck at her with his whip, and she returned\nIndignant to the Queen; whereat Geraint\nExclaiming, 'Surely I will learn the name,'\nMade sharply to the dwarf, and asked it of him,\nWho answered as before; and when the Prince\nHad put his horse in motion toward the knight,\nStruck at him with his whip, and cut his cheek.\nThe Prince's blood spirted upon the scarf,\nDyeing it; and his quick, instinctive hand\nCaught at the hilt, as to abolish him:\nBut he, from his exceeding manfulness\nAnd pure nobility of temperament,\nWroth to be wroth at such a worm, refrained\nFrom even a word, and so returning said:\n'I will avenge this insult, noble Queen,\nDone in your maiden's person to yourself:\nAnd I will track this vermin to their earths:\nFor though I ride unarmed, I do not doubt\nTo find, at some place I shall come at, arms\nOn loan, or else for pledge; and, being found,\nThen will I fight him, and will break his pride,\nAnd on the third day will again be here,\nSo that I be not fallen in fight.  Farewell.'\n'Farewell, fair Prince,' answered the stately Queen.\n'Be prosperous in this journey, as in all;\nAnd may you light on all things that you love,\nAnd live to wed with her whom first you love:\nBut ere you wed with any, bring your bride,\nAnd I, were she the daughter of a king,\nYea, though she were a beggar from the hedge,\nWill clothe her for her bridals like the sun.'\nAnd Prince Geraint, now thinking that he heard\nThe noble hart at bay, now the far horn,\nA little vext at losing of the hunt,\nA little at the vile occasion, rode,\nBy ups and downs, through many a grassy glade\nAnd valley, with fixt eye following the three.\nAt last they issued from the world of wood,\nAnd climbed upon a fair and even ridge,\nAnd showed themselves against the sky, and sank.\nAnd thither there came Geraint, and underneath\nBeheld the long street of a little town\nIn a long valley, on one side whereof,\nWhite from the mason's hand, a fortress rose;\nAnd on one side a castle in decay,\nBeyond a bridge that spanned a dry ravine:\nAnd out of town and valley came a noise\nAs of a broad brook o'er a shingly bed\nBrawling, or like a clamour of the rooks\nAt distance, ere they settle for the night.\nAnd onward to the fortress rode the three,\nAnd entered, and were lost behind the walls.\n'So,' thought Geraint, 'I have tracked him to his earth.'\nAnd down the long street riding wearily,\nFound every hostel full, and everywhere\nWas hammer laid to hoof, and the hot hiss\nAnd bustling whistle of the youth who scoured\nHis master's armour; and of such a one\nHe asked, 'What means the tumult in the town?'\nWho told him, scouring still, 'The sparrow-hawk!'\nThen riding close behind an ancient churl,\nWho, smitten by the dusty sloping beam,\nWent sweating underneath a sack of corn,\nAsked yet once more what meant the hubbub here?\nWho answered gruffly, 'Ugh! the sparrow-hawk.'\nThen riding further past an armourer's,\nWho, with back turned, and bowed above his work,\nSat riveting a helmet on his knee,\nHe put the self-same query, but the man\nNot turning round, nor looking at him, said:\n'Friend, he that labours for the sparrow-hawk\nHas little time for idle questioners.'\nWhereat Geraint flashed into sudden spleen:\n'A thousand pips eat up your sparrow-hawk!\nTits, wrens, and all winged nothings peck him dead!\nYe think the rustic cackle of your bourg\nThe murmur of the world!  What is it to me?\nO wretched set of sparrows, one and all,\nWho pipe of nothing but of sparrow-hawks!\nSpeak, if ye be not like the rest, hawk-mad,\nWhere can I get me harbourage for the night?\nAnd arms, arms, arms to fight my enemy?  Speak!'\nWhereat the armourer turning all amazed\nAnd seeing one so gay in purple silks,\nCame forward with the helmet yet in hand\nAnd answered, 'Pardon me, O stranger knight;\nWe hold a tourney here tomorrow morn,\nAnd there is scantly time for half the work.\nArms? truth! I know not:  all are wanted here.\nHarbourage? truth, good truth, I know not, save,\nIt may be, at Earl Yniol's, o'er the bridge\nYonder.'  He spoke and fell to work again.\nThen rode Geraint, a little spleenful yet,\nAcross the bridge that spanned the dry ravine.\nThere musing sat the hoary-headed Earl,\n(His dress a suit of frayed magnificence,\nOnce fit for feasts of ceremony) and said:\n'Whither, fair son?' to whom Geraint replied,\n'O friend, I seek a harbourage for the night.'\nThen Yniol, 'Enter therefore and partake\nThe slender entertainment of a house\nOnce rich, now poor, but ever open-doored.'\n'Thanks, venerable friend,' replied Geraint;\n'So that ye do not serve me sparrow-hawks\nFor supper, I will enter, I will eat\nWith all the passion of a twelve hours' fast.'\nThen sighed and smiled the hoary-headed Earl,\nAnd answered, 'Graver cause than yours is mine\nTo curse this hedgerow thief, the sparrow-hawk:\nBut in, go in; for save yourself desire it,\nWe will not touch upon him even in jest.'\nThen rode Geraint into the castle court,\nHis charger trampling many a prickly star\nOf sprouted thistle on the broken stones.\nHe looked and saw that all was ruinous.\nHere stood a shattered archway plumed with fern;\nAnd here had fallen a great part of a tower,\nWhole, like a crag that tumbles from the cliff,\nAnd like a crag was gay with wilding flowers:\nAnd high above a piece of turret stair,\nWorn by the feet that now were silent, wound\nBare to the sun, and monstrous ivy-stems\nClaspt the gray walls with hairy-fibred arms,\nAnd sucked the joining of the stones, and looked\nA knot, beneath, of snakes, aloft, a grove.\nAnd while he waited in the castle court,\nThe voice of Enid, Yniol's daughter, rang\nClear through the open casement of the hall,\nSinging; and as the sweet voice of a bird,\nHeard by the lander in a lonely isle,\nMoves him to think what kind of bird it is\nThat sings so delicately clear, and make\nConjecture of the plumage and the form;\nSo the sweet voice of Enid moved Geraint;\nAnd made him like a man abroad at morn\nWhen first the liquid note beloved of men\nComes flying over many a windy wave\nTo Britain, and in April suddenly\nBreaks from a coppice gemmed with green and red,\nAnd he suspends his converse with a friend,\nOr it may be the labour of his hands,\nTo think or say, 'There is the nightingale;'\nSo fared it with Geraint, who thought and said,\n'Here, by God's grace, is the one voice for me.'\nIt chanced the song that Enid sang was one\nOf Fortune and her wheel, and Enid sang:\n'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel and lower the proud;\nTurn thy wild wheel through sunshine, storm, and cloud;\nThy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.\n'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;\nWith that wild wheel we go not up or down;\nOur hoard is little, but our hearts are great.\n'Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;\nFrown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;\nFor man is man and master of his fate.\n'Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;\nThy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;\nThy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.'\n'Hark, by the bird's song ye may learn the nest,'\nSaid Yniol; 'enter quickly.'  Entering then,\nRight o'er a mount of newly-fallen stones,\nThe dusky-raftered many-cobwebbed hall,\nHe found an ancient dame in dim brocade;\nAnd near her, like a blossom vermeil-white,\nThat lightly breaks a faded flower-sheath,\nMoved the fair Enid, all in faded silk,\nHer daughter.  In a moment thought Geraint,\n'Here by God's rood is the one maid for me.'\nBut none spake word except the hoary Earl:\n'Enid, the good knight's horse stands in the court;\nTake him to stall, and give him corn, and then\nGo to the town and buy us flesh and wine;\nAnd we will make us merry as we may.\nOur hoard is little, but our hearts are great.'\nHe spake:  the Prince, as Enid past him, fain\nTo follow, strode a stride, but Yniol caught\nHis purple scarf, and held, and said, 'Forbear!\nRest! the good house, though ruined, O my son,\nEndures not that her guest should serve himself.'\nAnd reverencing the custom of the house\nGeraint, from utter courtesy, forbore.\nSo Enid took his charger to the stall;\nAnd after went her way across the bridge,\nAnd reached the town, and while the Prince and Earl\nYet spoke together, came again with one,\nA youth, that following with a costrel bore\nThe means of goodly welcome, flesh and wine.\nAnd Enid brought sweet cakes to make them cheer,\nAnd in her veil enfolded, manchet bread.\nAnd then, because their hall must also serve\nFor kitchen, boiled the flesh, and spread the board,\nAnd stood behind, and waited on the three.\nAnd seeing her so sweet and serviceable,\nGeraint had longing in him evermore\nTo stoop and kiss the tender little thumb,\nThat crost the trencher as she laid it down:\nBut after all had eaten, then Geraint,\nFor now the wine made summer in his veins,\nLet his eye rove in following, or rest\nOn Enid at her lowly handmaid-work,\nNow here, now there, about the dusky hall;\nThen suddenly addrest the hoary Earl:\n'Fair Host and Earl, I pray your courtesy;\nThis sparrow-hawk, what is he? tell me of him.\nHis name? but no, good faith, I will not have it:\nFor if he be the knight whom late I saw\nRide into that new fortress by your town,\nWhite from the mason's hand, then have I sworn\nFrom his own lips to have it--I am Geraint\nOf Devon--for this morning when the Queen\nSent her own maiden to demand the name,\nHis dwarf, a vicious under-shapen thing,\nStruck at her with his whip, and she returned\nIndignant to the Queen; and then I swore\nThat I would track this caitiff to his hold,\nAnd fight and break his pride, and have it of him.\nAnd all unarmed I rode, and thought to find\nArms in your town, where all the men are mad;\nThey take the rustic murmur of their bourg\nFor the great wave that echoes round the world;\nThey would not hear me speak:  but if ye know\nWhere I can light on arms, or if yourself\nShould have them, tell me, seeing I have sworn\nThat I will break his pride and learn his name,\nAvenging this great insult done the Queen.'\nThen cried Earl Yniol, 'Art thou he indeed,\nGeraint, a name far-sounded among men\nFor noble deeds? and truly I, when first\nI saw you moving by me on the bridge,\nFelt ye were somewhat, yea, and by your state\nAnd presence might have guessed you one of those\nThat eat in Arthur's hall in Camelot.\nNor speak I now from foolish flattery;\nFor this dear child hath often heard me praise\nYour feats of arms, and often when I paused\nHath asked again, and ever loved to hear;\nSo grateful is the noise of noble deeds\nTo noble hearts who see but acts of wrong:\nO never yet had woman such a pair\nOf suitors as this maiden:  first Limours,\nA creature wholly given to brawls and wine,\nDrunk even when he wooed; and be he dead\nI know not, but he past to the wild land.\nThe second was your foe, the sparrow-hawk,\nMy curse, my nephew--I will not let his name\nSlip from my lips if I can help it--he,\nWhen that I knew him fierce and turbulent\nRefused her to him, then his pride awoke;\nAnd since the proud man often is the mean,\nHe sowed a slander in the common ear,\nAffirming that his father left him gold,\nAnd in my charge, which was not rendered to him;\nBribed with large promises the men who served\nAbout my person, the more easily\nBecause my means were somewhat broken into\nThrough open doors and hospitality;\nRaised my own town against me in the night\nBefore my Enid's birthday, sacked my house;\nFrom mine own earldom foully ousted me;\nBuilt that new fort to overawe my friends,\nFor truly there are those who love me yet;\nAnd keeps me in this ruinous castle here,\nWhere doubtless he would put me soon to death,\nBut that his pride too much despises me:\nAnd I myself sometimes despise myself;\nFor I have let men be, and have their way;\nAm much too gentle, have not used my power:\nNor know I whether I be very base\nOr very manful, whether very wise\nOr very foolish; only this I know,\nThat whatsoever evil happen to me,\nI seem to suffer nothing heart or limb,\nBut can endure it all most patiently.'\n'Well said, true heart,' replied Geraint, 'but arms,\nThat if the sparrow-hawk, this nephew, fight\nIn next day's tourney I may break his pride.'\nAnd Yniol answered, 'Arms, indeed, but old\nAnd rusty, old and rusty, Prince Geraint,\nAre mine, and therefore at thy asking, thine.\nBut in this tournament can no man tilt,\nExcept the lady he loves best be there.\nTwo forks are fixt into the meadow ground,\nAnd over these is placed a silver wand,\nAnd over that a golden sparrow-hawk,\nThe prize of beauty for the fairest there.\nAnd this, what knight soever be in field\nLays claim to for the lady at his side,\nAnd tilts with my good nephew thereupon,\nWho being apt at arms and big of bone\nHas ever won it for the lady with him,\nAnd toppling over all antagonism\nHas earned himself the name of sparrow-hawk.'\nBut thou, that hast no lady, canst not fight.'\nTo whom Geraint with eyes all bright replied,\nLeaning a little toward him, 'Thy leave!\nLet ME lay lance in rest, O noble host,\nFor this dear child, because I never saw,\nThough having seen all beauties of our time,\nNor can see elsewhere, anything so fair.\nAnd if I fall her name will yet remain\nUntarnished as before; but if I live,\nSo aid me Heaven when at mine uttermost,\nAs I will make her truly my true wife.'\nThen, howsoever patient, Yniol's heart\nDanced in his bosom, seeing better days,\nAnd looking round he saw not Enid there,\n(Who hearing her own name had stolen away)\nBut that old dame, to whom full tenderly\nAnd folding all her hand in his he said,\n'Mother, a maiden is a tender thing,\nAnd best by her that bore her understood.\nGo thou to rest, but ere thou go to rest\nTell her, and prove her heart toward the Prince.'\nSo spake the kindly-hearted Earl, and she\nWith frequent smile and nod departing found,\nHalf disarrayed as to her rest, the girl;\nWhom first she kissed on either cheek, and then\nOn either shining shoulder laid a hand,\nAnd kept her off and gazed upon her face,\nAnd told them all their converse in the hall,\nProving her heart:  but never light and shade\nCoursed one another more on open ground\nBeneath a troubled heaven, than red and pale\nAcross the face of Enid hearing her;\nWhile slowly falling as a scale that falls,\nWhen weight is added only grain by grain,\nSank her sweet head upon her gentle breast;\nNor did she lift an eye nor speak a word,\nRapt in the fear and in the wonder of it;\nSo moving without answer to her rest\nShe found no rest, and ever failed to draw\nThe quiet night into her blood, but lay\nContemplating her own unworthiness;\nAnd when the pale and bloodless east began\nTo quicken to the sun, arose, and raised\nHer mother too, and hand in hand they moved\nDown to the meadow where the jousts were held,\nAnd waited there for Yniol and Geraint.\nAnd thither came the twain, and when Geraint\nBeheld her first in field, awaiting him,\nHe felt, were she the prize of bodily force,\nHimself beyond the rest pushing could move\nThe chair of Idris.  Yniol's rusted arms\nWere on his princely person, but through these\nPrincelike his bearing shone; and errant knights\nAnd ladies came, and by and by the town\nFlowed in, and settling circled all the lists.\nAnd there they fixt the forks into the ground,\nAnd over these they placed the silver wand,\nAnd over that the golden sparrow-hawk.\nThen Yniol's nephew, after trumpet blown,\nSpake to the lady with him and proclaimed,\n'Advance and take, as fairest of the fair,\nWhat I these two years past have won for thee,\nThe prize of beauty.'  Loudly spake the Prince,\n'Forbear:  there is a worthier,' and the knight\nWith some surprise and thrice as much disdain\nTurned, and beheld the four, and all his face\nGlowed like the heart of a great fire at Yule,\nSo burnt he was with passion, crying out,\n'Do battle for it then,' no more; and thrice\nThey clashed together, and thrice they brake their spears.\nThen each, dishorsed and drawing, lashed at each\nSo often and with such blows, that all the crowd\nWondered, and now and then from distant walls\nThere came a clapping as of phantom hands.\nSo twice they fought, and twice they breathed, and still\nThe dew of their great labour, and the blood\nOf their strong bodies, flowing, drained their force.\nBut either's force was matched till Yniol's cry,\n'Remember that great insult done the Queen,'\nIncreased Geraint's, who heaved his blade aloft,\nAnd cracked the helmet through, and bit the bone,\nAnd felled him, and set foot upon his breast,\nAnd said, 'Thy name?'  To whom the fallen man\nMade answer, groaning, 'Edyrn, son of Nudd!\nAshamed am I that I should tell it thee.\nMy pride is broken:  men have seen my fall.'\n'Then, Edyrn, son of Nudd,' replied Geraint,\n'These two things shalt thou do, or else thou diest.\nFirst, thou thyself, with damsel and with dwarf,\nShalt ride to Arthur's court, and coming there,\nCrave pardon for that insult done the Queen,\nAnd shalt abide her judgment on it; next,\nThou shalt give back their earldom to thy kin.\nThese two things shalt thou do, or thou shalt die.'\nAnd Edyrn answered, 'These things will I do,\nFor I have never yet been overthrown,\nAnd thou hast overthrown me, and my pride\nIs broken down, for Enid sees my fall!'\nAnd rising up, he rode to Arthur's court,\nAnd there the Queen forgave him easily.\nAnd being young, he changed and came to loathe\nHis crime of traitor, slowly drew himself\nBright from his old dark life, and fell at last\nIn the great battle fighting for the King.\nBut when the third day from the hunting-morn\nMade a low splendour in the world, and wings\nMoved in her ivy, Enid, for she lay\nWith her fair head in the dim-yellow light,\nAmong the dancing shadows of the birds,\nWoke and bethought her of her promise given\nNo later than last eve to Prince Geraint--\nSo bent he seemed on going the third day,\nHe would not leave her, till her promise given--\nTo ride with him this morning to the court,\nAnd there be made known to the stately Queen,\nAnd there be wedded with all ceremony.\nAt this she cast her eyes upon her dress,\nAnd thought it never yet had looked so mean.\nFor as a leaf in mid-November is\nTo what it is in mid-October, seemed\nThe dress that now she looked on to the dress\nShe looked on ere the coming of Geraint.\nAnd still she looked, and still the terror grew\nOf that strange bright and dreadful thing, a court,\nAll staring at her in her faded silk:\nAnd softly to her own sweet heart she said:\n'This noble prince who won our earldom back,\nSo splendid in his acts and his attire,\nSweet heaven, how much I shall discredit him!\nWould he could tarry with us here awhile,\nBut being so beholden to the Prince,\nIt were but little grace in any of us,\nBent as he seemed on going this third day,\nTo seek a second favour at his hands.\nYet if he could but tarry a day or two,\nMyself would work eye dim, and finger lame,\nFar liefer than so much discredit him.'\nAnd Enid fell in longing for a dress\nAll branched and flowered with gold, a costly gift\nOf her good mother, given her on the night\nBefore her birthday, three sad years ago,\nThat night of fire, when Edyrn sacked their house,\nAnd scattered all they had to all the winds:\nFor while the mother showed it, and the two\nWere turning and admiring it, the work\nTo both appeared so costly, rose a cry\nThat Edyrn's men were on them, and they fled\nWith little save the jewels they had on,\nWhich being sold and sold had bought them bread:\nAnd Edyrn's men had caught them in their flight,\nAnd placed them in this ruin; and she wished\nThe Prince had found her in her ancient home;\nThen let her fancy flit across the past,\nAnd roam the goodly places that she knew;\nAnd last bethought her how she used to watch,\nNear that old home, a pool of golden carp;\nAnd one was patched and blurred and lustreless\nAmong his burnished brethren of the pool;\nAnd half asleep she made comparison\nOf that and these to her own faded self\nAnd the gay court, and fell asleep again;\nAnd dreamt herself was such a faded form\nAmong her burnished sisters of the pool;\nBut this was in the garden of a king;\nAnd though she lay dark in the pool, she knew\nThat all was bright; that all about were birds\nOf sunny plume in gilded trellis-work;\nThat all the turf was rich in plots that looked\nEach like a garnet or a turkis in it;\nAnd lords and ladies of the high court went\nIn silver tissue talking things of state;\nAnd children of the King in cloth of gold\nGlanced at the doors or gamboled down the walks;\nAnd while she thought 'They will not see me,' came\nA stately queen whose name was Guinevere,\nAnd all the children in their cloth of gold\nRan to her, crying, 'If we have fish at all\nLet them be gold; and charge the gardeners now\nTo pick the faded creature from the pool,\nAnd cast it on the mixen that it die.'\nAnd therewithal one came and seized on her,\nAnd Enid started waking, with her heart\nAll overshadowed by the foolish dream,\nAnd lo! it was her mother grasping her\nTo get her well awake; and in her hand\nA suit of bright apparel, which she laid\nFlat on the couch, and spoke exultingly:\n'See here, my child, how fresh the colours look,\nHow fast they hold like colours of a shell\nThat keeps the wear and polish of the wave.\nWhy not?  It never yet was worn, I trow:\nLook on it, child, and tell me if ye know it.'\nAnd Enid looked, but all confused at first,\nCould scarce divide it from her foolish dream:\nThen suddenly she knew it and rejoiced,\nAnd answered, 'Yea, I know it; your good gift,\nSo sadly lost on that unhappy night;\nYour own good gift!'  'Yea, surely,' said the dame,\n'And gladly given again this happy morn.\nFor when the jousts were ended yesterday,\nWent Yniol through the town, and everywhere\nHe found the sack and plunder of our house\nAll scattered through the houses of the town;\nAnd gave command that all which once was ours\nShould now be ours again:  and yester-eve,\nWhile ye were talking sweetly with your Prince,\nCame one with this and laid it in my hand,\nFor love or fear, or seeking favour of us,\nBecause we have our earldom back again.\nAnd yester-eve I would not tell you of it,\nBut kept it for a sweet surprise at morn.\nYea, truly is it not a sweet surprise?\nFor I myself unwillingly have worn\nMy faded suit, as you, my child, have yours,\nAnd howsoever patient, Yniol his.\nAh, dear, he took me from a goodly house,\nWith store of rich apparel, sumptuous fare,\nAnd page, and maid, and squire, and seneschal,\nAnd pastime both of hawk and hound, and all\nThat appertains to noble maintenance.\nYea, and he brought me to a goodly house;\nBut since our fortune swerved from sun to shade,\nAnd all through that young traitor, cruel need\nConstrained us, but a better time has come;\nSo clothe yourself in this, that better fits\nOur mended fortunes and a Prince's bride:\nFor though ye won the prize of fairest fair,\nAnd though I heard him call you fairest fair,\nLet never maiden think, however fair,\nShe is not fairer in new clothes than old.\nAnd should some great court-lady say, the Prince\nHath picked a ragged-robin from the hedge,\nAnd like a madman brought her to the court,\nThen were ye shamed, and, worse, might shame the Prince\nTo whom we are beholden; but I know,\nThat when my dear child is set forth at her best,\nThat neither court nor country, though they sought\nThrough all the provinces like those of old\nThat lighted on Queen Esther, has her match.'\nHere ceased the kindly mother out of breath;\nAnd Enid listened brightening as she lay;\nThen, as the white and glittering star of morn\nParts from a bank of snow, and by and by\nSlips into golden cloud, the maiden rose,\nAnd left her maiden couch, and robed herself,\nHelped by the mother's careful hand and eye,\nWithout a mirror, in the gorgeous gown;\nWho, after, turned her daughter round, and said,\nShe never yet had seen her half so fair;\nAnd called her like that maiden in the tale,\nWhom Gwydion made by glamour out of flowers\nAnd sweeter than the bride of Cassivelaun,\nFlur, for whose love the Roman Csar first\nInvaded Britain, 'But we beat him back,\nAs this great Prince invaded us, and we,\nNot beat him back, but welcomed him with joy\nAnd I can scarcely ride with you to court,\nFor old am I, and rough the ways and wild;\nBut Yniol goes, and I full oft shall dream\nI see my princess as I see her now,\nClothed with my gift, and gay among the gay.'\nBut while the women thus rejoiced, Geraint\nWoke where he slept in the high hall, and called\nFor Enid, and when Yniol made report\nOf that good mother making Enid gay\nIn such apparel as might well beseem\nHis princess, or indeed the stately Queen,\nHe answered:  'Earl, entreat her by my love,\nAlbeit I give no reason but my wish,\nThat she ride with me in her faded silk.'\nYniol with that hard message went; it fell\nLike flaws in summer laying lusty corn:\nFor Enid, all abashed she knew not why,\nDared not to glance at her good mother's face,\nBut silently, in all obedience,\nHer mother silent too, nor helping her,\nLaid from her limbs the costly-broidered gift,\nAnd robed them in her ancient suit again,\nAnd so descended.  Never man rejoiced\nMore than Geraint to greet her thus attired;\nAnd glancing all at once as keenly at her\nAs careful robins eye the delver's toil,\nMade her cheek burn and either eyelid fall,\nBut rested with her sweet face satisfied;\nThen seeing cloud upon the mother's brow,\nHer by both hands she caught, and sweetly said,\n'O my new mother, be not wroth or grieved\nAt thy new son, for my petition to her.\nWhen late I left Caerleon, our great Queen,\nIn words whose echo lasts, they were so sweet,\nMade promise, that whatever bride I brought,\nHerself would clothe her like the sun in Heaven.\nThereafter, when I reached this ruined hall,\nBeholding one so bright in dark estate,\nI vowed that could I gain her, our fair Queen,\nNo hand but hers, should make your Enid burst\nSunlike from cloud--and likewise thought perhaps,\nThat service done so graciously would bind\nThe two together; fain I would the two\nShould love each other:  how can Enid find\nA nobler friend?  Another thought was mine;\nI came among you here so suddenly,\nThat though her gentle presence at the lists\nMight well have served for proof that I was loved,\nI doubted whether daughter's tenderness,\nOr easy nature, might not let itself\nBe moulded by your wishes for her weal;\nOr whether some false sense in her own self\nOf my contrasting brightness, overbore\nHer fancy dwelling in this dusky hall;\nAnd such a sense might make her long for court\nAnd all its perilous glories:  and I thought,\nThat could I someway prove such force in her\nLinked with such love for me, that at a word\n(No reason given her) she could cast aside\nA splendour dear to women, new to her,\nAnd therefore dearer; or if not so new,\nYet therefore tenfold dearer by the power\nOf intermitted usage; then I felt\nThat I could rest, a rock in ebbs and flows,\nFixt on her faith.  Now, therefore, I do rest,\nA prophet certain of my prophecy,\nThat never shadow of mistrust can cross\nBetween us.  Grant me pardon for my thoughts:\nAnd for my strange petition I will make\nAmends hereafter by some gaudy-day,\nWhen your fair child shall wear your costly gift\nBeside your own warm hearth, with, on her knees,\nWho knows? another gift of the high God,\nWhich, maybe, shall have learned to lisp you thanks.'\nHe spoke:  the mother smiled, but half in tears,\nThen brought a mantle down and wrapt her in it,\nAnd claspt and kissed her, and they rode away.\nNow thrice that morning Guinevere had climbed\nThe giant tower, from whose high crest, they say,\nMen saw the goodly hills of Somerset,\nAnd white sails flying on the yellow sea;\nBut not to goodly hill or yellow sea\nLooked the fair Queen, but up the vale of Usk,\nBy the flat meadow, till she saw them come;\nAnd then descending met them at the gates,\nEmbraced her with all welcome as a friend,\nAnd did her honour as the Prince's bride,\nAnd clothed her for her bridals like the sun;\nAnd all that week was old Caerleon gay,\nFor by the hands of Dubric, the high saint,\nThey twain were wedded with all ceremony.\nAnd this was on the last year's Whitsuntide.\nBut Enid ever kept the faded silk,\nRemembering how first he came on her,\nDrest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,\nAnd all her foolish fears about the dress,\nAnd all his journey toward her, as himself\nHad told her, and their coming to the court.\nAnd now this morning when he said to her,\n'Put on your worst and meanest dress,' she found\nAnd took it, and arrayed herself therein.",

    "Black trees against an orange sky,\nTrees that the wind shook terribly,\nLike a harsh spume along the road,\nQuavering up like withered arms,\nWrithing like streams, like twisted charms\nOf hot lead flung in snow. Below\nThe iron ice stung like a goad,\nSlashing the torn shoes from my feet,\nAnd all the air was bitter sleet.\nAnd all the land was cramped with snow,\nSteel-strong and fierce and glimmering wan,\nLike pale plains of obsidian.\n-- And yet I strove -- and I was fire\nAnd ice -- and fire and ice were one\nIn one vast hunger of desire.\nA dim desire, of pleasant places,\nAnd lush fields in the summer sun,\nAnd logs aflame, and walls, and faces,\n-- And wine, and old ambrosial talk,\nA golden ball in fountains dancing,\nAnd unforgotten hands. (Ah, God,\nI trod them down where I have trod,\nAnd they remain, and they remain,\nEtched in unutterable pain,\nLoved lips and faces now apart,\nThat once were closer than my heart --\nIn agony, in agony,\nAnd horribly a part of me. . . .\nFor Lethe is for no man set,\nAnd in Hell may no man forget.)\nAnd there were flowers, and jugs, bright-glancing,\nAnd old Italian swords -- and looks,\nA moment's glance of fire, of fire,\nSpiring, leaping, flaming higher,\nInto the intense, the cloudless blue,\nUntil two souls were one, and flame,\nAnd very flesh, and yet the same!\nAs if all springs were crushed anew\nInto one globed drop of dew!\nBut for the most I thought of heat,\nDesiring greatly. . . . Hot white sand\nThe lazy body lies at rest in,\nOr sun-dried, scented grass to nest in,\nAnd fires, innumerable fires,\nGreat fagots hurling golden gyres\nOf sparks far up, and the red heart\nIn sea-coals, crashing as they part\nTo tiny flares, and kindling snapping,\nBunched sticks that burst their string and wrapping\nAnd fall like jackstraws; green and blue\nThe evil flames of driftwood too,\nAnd heavy, sullen lumps of coke\nWith still, fierce heat and ugly smoke. . . .\n. . . And then the vision of his face,\nAnd theirs, all theirs, came like a sword,\nThrice, to the heart -- and as I fell\nI thought I saw a light before.\nI woke. My hands were blue and sore,\nTorn on the ice. I scarcely felt\nThe frozen sleet begin to melt\nUpon my face as I breathed deeper,\nBut lay there warmly, like a sleeper\nWho shifts his arm once, and moans low,\nAnd then sinks back to night. Slow, slow,\nAnd still as Death, came Sleep and Death\nAnd looked at me with quiet breath.\nUnbending figures, black and stark\nAgainst the intense deeps of the dark.\nTall and like trees. Like sweet and fire\nRest crept and crept along my veins,\nGently. And there were no more pains. . . .\nWas it not better so to lie?\nThe fight was done. Even gods tire\nOf fighting. . . . My way was the wrong.\nNow I should drift and drift along\nTo endless quiet, golden peace . . .\nAnd let the tortured body cease.\nAnd then a light winked like an eye.\n. . . And very many miles away\nA girl stood at a warm, lit door,\nHolding a lamp. Ray upon ray\nIt cloaked the snow with perfect light.\nAnd where she was there was no night\nNor could be, ever. God is sure,\nAnd in his hands are things secure.\nIt is not given me to trace\nThe lovely laughter of that face,\nLike a clear brook most full of light,\nOr olives swaying on a height,\nSo silver they have wings, almost;\nLike a great word once known and lost\nAnd meaning all things. Nor her voice\nA happy sound where larks rejoice,\nHer body, that great loveliness,\nThe tender fashion of her dress,\nI may not paint them.\nThese I see,\nBlazing through all eternity,\nA fire-winged sign, a glorious tree!\nShe stood there, and at once I knew\nThe bitter thing that I must do.\nThere could be no surrender now;\nThough Sleep and Death were whispering low.\nMy way was wrong. So. Would it mend\nIf I shrank back before the end?\nAnd sank to death and cowardice?\nNo, the last lees must be drained up,\nBase wine from an ignoble cup;\n(Yet not so base as sleek content\nWhen I had shrunk from punishment)\nThe wretched body strain anew!\nLife was a storm to wander through.\nI took the wrong way. Good and well,\nAt least my feet sought out not Hell!\nThough night were one consuming flame\nI must go on for my base aim,\nAnd so, perhaps, make evil grow\nTo something clean by agony . . .\nAnd reach that light upon the snow . . .\nAnd touch her dress at last . . .\nSo, so,\nI crawled. I could not speak or see\nSave dimly. The ice glared like fire,\nA long bright Hell of choking cold,\nAnd each vein was a tautened wire,\nThrobbing with torture -- and I crawled.\nMy hands were wounds.\nSo I attained\nThe second Hell. The snow was stained\nI thought, and shook my head at it\nHow red it was! Black tree-roots clutched\nAnd tore -- and soon the snow was smutched\nAnew; and I lurched babbling on,\nAnd then fell down to rest a bit,\nAnd came upon another Hell . . .\nLoose stones that ice made terrible,\nThat rolled and gashed men as they fell.\nI stumbled, slipped . . . and all was gone\nThat I had gained. Once more I lay\nBefore the long bright Hell of ice.\nAnd still the light was far away.\nThere was red mist before my eyes\nOr I could tell you how I went\nAcross the swaying firmament,\nA glittering torture of cold stars,\nAnd how I fought in Titan wars . . .\nAnd died . . . and lived again upon\nThe rack . . . and how the horses strain\nWhen their red task is nearly done. . . .\nI only know that there was Pain,\nInfinite and eternal Pain.\nAnd that I fell -- and rose again.\nSo she was walking in the road.\nAnd I stood upright like a man,\nOnce, and fell blind, and heard her cry . . .\nAnd then there came long agony.\nThere was no pain when I awoke,\nNo pain at all. Rest, like a goad,\nSpurred my eyes open -- and light broke\nUpon them like a million swords:\nAnd she was there. There are no words.\nHeaven is for a moment's span.\nAnd ever.\nSo I spoke and said,\n\"My honor stands up unbetrayed,\nAnd I have seen you. Dear . . .\"\nSharp pain\nClosed like a cloak. . . .\nI moaned and died.\nHere, even here, these things remain.\nI shall draw nearer to her side.\nOh dear and laughing, lost to me,\nHidden in grey Eternity,\nI shall attain, with burning feet,\nTo you and to the mercy-seat!\nThe ages crumble down like dust,\nDark roses, deviously thrust\nAnd scattered in sweet wine -- but I,\nI shall lift up to you my cry,\nAnd kiss your wet lips presently\nBeneath the ever-living Tree.\nThis in my heart I keep for goad!\nSomewhere, in Heaven she walks that road.\nSomewhere . . . in Heaven . . . she walks . . . that . . . road. . . .",

    "I.\nI dream of you walking at night along the streams\nof the country of my birth, warm blooms and the nightsongs\nof birds opening around you as you walk.\nYou are holding in your body the dark seed of my sleep.\nII.\nThis comes after silence. Was it something I said\nthat bound me to you, some mere promise\nor, worse, the fear of loneliness and death?\nA man lost in the woods in the dark, I stood\nstill and said nothing. And then there rose in me,\nlike the earth's empowering brew rising\nin root and branch, the words of a dream of you\nI did not know I had dreamed. I was a wanderer\nwho feels the solace of his native land\nunder his feet again and moving in his blood.\nI went on, blind and faithful. Where I stepped\nmy track was there to steady me. It was no abyss\nthat lay before me, but only the level ground.\nIII.\nSometimes our life reminds me\nof a forest in which there is a graceful clearing\nand in that opening a house,\nan orchard and garden,\ncomfortable shades, and flowers\nred and yellow in the sun, a pattern\nmade in the light for the light to return to.\nThe forest is mostly dark, its ways\nto be made anew day after day, the dark\nricher than the light and more blessed,\nprovided we stay brave\nenough to keep on going in.\nIV.\nHow many times have I come to you out of my head\nwith joy, if ever a man was,\nfor to approach you I have given up the light\nand all directions. I come to you\nlost, wholly trusting as a man who goes\ninto the forest unarmed. It is as though I descend\nslowly earthward out of the air. I rest in peace\nin you, when I arrive at last.\nV.\nOur bond is no little economy based on the exchange\nof my love and work for yours, so much for so much\nof an expendable fund. We don't know what its limits are--\nthat puts us in the dark. We are more together\nthan we know, how else could we keep on discovering\nwe are more together than we thought?\nYou are the known way leading always to the unknown,\nand you are the known place to which the unknown is always\nleading me back. More blessed in you than I know,\nI possess nothing worthy to give you, nothing\nnot belittled by my saying that I possess it.\nEven an hour of love is a moral predicament, a blessing\na man may be hard up to be worthy of. He can only\naccept it, as a plant accepts from all the bounty of the light\nenough to live, and then accepts the dark,\npassing unencumbered back to the earth, as I\nhave fallen tine and again from the great strength\nof my desire, helpless, into your arms.\nVI.\nWhat I am learning to give you is my death\nto set you free of me, and me from myself\ninto the dark and the new light. Like the water\nof a deep stream, love is always too much. We\ndid not make it. Though we drink till we burst\nwe cannot have it all, or want it all.\nIn its abundance it survives our thirst.\nIn the evening we come down to the shore\nto drink our fill, and sleep, while it\nflows through the regions of the dark.\nIt does not hold us, except we keep returning\nto its rich waters thirsty. We enter,\nwilling to die, into the commonwealth of its joy.\nVII.\nI give you what is unbounded, passing from dark to dark,\ncontaining darkness: a night of rain, an early morning.\nI give you the life I have let live for the love of you:\na clump of orange-blooming weeds beside the road,\nthe young orchard waiting in the snow, our own life\nthat we have planted in the ground, as I\nhave planted mine in you. I give you my love for all\nbeautiful and honest women that you gather to yourself\nagain and again, and satisfy--and this poem,\nno more mine than any man's who has loved a woman.",

    "I\nHe who has looked upon Earth\nDeeper than flower and fruit,\nLosing some hue of his mirth,\nAs the tree striking rock at the root,\nUnto him shall the marvellous tale\nOf Callistes more humanly come\nWith the touch on his breast than a hail\nFrom the markets that hum.\nII\nNow the youth footed swift to the dawn.\n'Twas the season when wintertide,\nIn the higher rock-hollows updrawn,\nLeaves meadows to bud, and he spied,\nBy light throwing shallow shade,\nBetween the beam and the gloom,\nSicilian Enna, whose Maid\nSuch aspect wears in her bloom\nUnderneath since the Charioteer\nOf Darkness whirled her away,\nOn a reaped afternoon of the year,\nNigh the poppy-droop of Day.\nO and naked of her, all dust,\nThe majestic Mother and Nurse,\nRinging cries to the God, the Just,\nCurled the land with the blight of her curse:\nRecollected of this glad isle\nStill quaking. But now more fair,\nAnd momently fraying the while\nThe veil of the shadows there,\nSoft Enna that prostrate grief\nSang through, and revealed round the vines,\nBronze-orange, the crisp young leaf,\nThe wheat-blades tripping in lines,\nA hue unillumined by sun\nOf the flowers flooding grass as from founts:\nAll the penetrable dun\nOf the morn ere she mounts.\nIII\nNor had saffron and sapphire and red\nWaved aloft to their sisters below,\nWhen gaped by the rock-channel head\nOf the lake, black, a cave at one blow,\nReverberant over the plain:\nA sound oft fearfully swung\nFor the coming of wrathful rain:\nAnd forth, like the dragon-tongue\nOf a fire beaten flat by the gale,\nBut more as the smoke to behold,\nA chariot burst. Then a wail\nQuivered high of the love that would fold\nBliss immeasurable, bigger than heart,\nThough a God's: and the wheels were stayed,\nAnd the team of the chariot swart\nReared in marble, the six, dismayed,\nLike hoofs that by night plashing sea\nCurve and ramp from the vast swan-wave:\nFor, lo, the Great Mother, She!\nAnd Callistes gazed, he gave\nHis eyeballs up to the sight:\nThe embrace of the Twain, of whom\nTo men are their day, their night,\nMellow fruits and the shearing tomb:\nOur Lady of the Sheaves\nAnd the Lily of Hades, the Sweet\nOf Enna: he saw through leaves\nThe Mother and Daughter meet.\nThey stood by the chariot-wheel,\nEmbraced, very tall, most like\nFellow poplars, wind-taken, that reel\nDown their shivering columns and strike\nHead to head, crossing throats: and apart,\nFor the feast of the look, they drew,\nWhich Darkness no longer could thwart;\nAnd they broke together anew,\nExulting to tears, flower and bud.\nBut the mate of the Rayless was grave:\nShe smiled like Sleep on its flood,\nThat washes of all we crave:\nLike the trance of eyes awake\nAnd the spirit enshrouded, she cast\nThe wan underworld on the lake.\nThey were so, and they passed.\nIV\nHe tells it, who knew the law\nUpon mortals: he stood alive\nDeclaring that this he saw:\nHe could see, and survive.\nV\nNow the youth was not ware of the beams\nWith the grasses intertwined,\nFor each thing seen, as in dreams,\nCame stepping to rear through his mind,\nTill it struck his remembered prayer\nTo be witness of this which had flown\nLike a smoke melted thinner than air,\nThat the vacancy doth disown.\nAnd viewing a maiden, he thought\nIt might now be morn, and afar\nWithin him the memory wrought\nOf a something that slipped from the car\nWhen those, the august, moved by:\nPerchance a scarf, and perchance\nThis maiden. She did not fly,\nNor started at his advance:\nShe looked, as when infinite thirst\nPants pausing to bless the springs,\nRefreshed, unsated. Then first\nHe trembled with awe of the things\nHe had seen; and he did transfer,\nDivining and doubting in turn,\nHis reverence unto her;\nNor asked what he crouched to learn:\nThe whence of her, whither, and why\nHer presence there, and her name,\nHer parentage: under which sky\nHer birth, and how hither she came,\nSo young, a virgin, alone,\nUnfriended, having no fear,\nAs Oreads have; no moan,\nLike the lost upon earth; no tear;\nNot a sign of the torch in the blood,\nThough her stature had reached the height\nWhen mantles a tender rud\nIn maids that of youths have sight,\nIf maids of our seed they be:\nFor he said: A glad vision art thou!\nAnd she answered him: Thou to me!\nAs men utter a vow.\nVI\nThen said she, quick as the cries\nOf the rainy cranes: Light! light!\nAnd Helios rose in her eyes,\nThat were full as the dew-balls bright,\nRelucent to him as dews\nUnshaded. Breathing, she sent\nHer voice to the God of the Muse,\nAnd along the vale it went,\nStrange to hear: not thin, not shrill:\nSweet, but no young maid's throat:\nThe echo beyond the hill\nRan falling on half the note:\nAnd under the shaken ground\nWhere the Hundred-headed groans\nBy the roots of great AEtna bound,\nAs of him were hollow tones\nOf wondering roared: a tale\nRepeated to sunless halls.\nBut now off the face of the vale\nShadows fled in a breath, and the walls\nOf the lake's rock-head were gold,\nAnd the breast of the lake, that swell\nOf the crestless long wave rolled\nTo shore-bubble, pebble and shell.\nA morning of radiant lids\nO'er the dance of the earth opened wide:\nThe bees chose their flowers, the snub kids\nUpon hindlegs went sportive, or plied,\nNosing, hard at the dugs to be filled:\nThere was milk, honey, music to make:\nUp their branches the little birds billed:\nChirrup, drone, bleat and buzz ringed the lake.\nO shining in sunlight, chief\nAfter water and water's caress,\nWas the young bronze-orange leaf,\nThat clung to the tree as a tress,\nShooting lucid tendrils to wed\nWith the vine-hook tree or pole,\nLike Arachne launched out on her thread.\nThen the maiden her dusky stole\nIn the span of the black-starred zone,\nGathered up for her footing fleet.\nAs one that had toil of her own\nShe followed the lines of wheat\nTripping straight through the fields, green blades,\nTo the groves of olive grey,\nDowny-grey, golden-tinged: and to glades\nWhere the pear-blossom thickens the spray\nIn a night, like the snow-packed storm:\nPear, apple, almond, plum:\nNot wintry now: pushing, warm!\nAnd she touched them with finger and thumb,\nAs the vine-hook closes: she smiled,\nRecounting again and again,\nCorn, wine, fruit, oil! like a child,\nWith the meaning known to men.\nFor hours in the track of the plough\nAnd the pruning-knife she stepped,\nAnd of how the seed works, and of how\nYields the soil, she seemed adept.\nThen she murmured that name of the dearth,\nThe Beneficent, Hers, who bade\nOur husbandmen sow for the birth\nOf the grain making earth full glad.\nShe murmured that Other's: the dirge\nOf life-light: for whose dark lap\nOur locks are clipped on the verge\nOf the realm where runs no sap.\nShe said: We have looked on both!\nAnd her eyes had a wavering beam\nOf various lights, like the froth\nOf the storm-swollen ravine stream\nIn flame of the bolt. What links\nWere these which had made him her friend?\nHe eyed her, as one who drinks,\nAnd would drink to the end.\nVII\nNow the meadows with crocus besprent,\nAnd the asphodel woodsides she left,\nAnd the lake-slopes, the ravishing scent\nOf narcissus, dark-sweet, for the cleft\nThat tutors the torrent-brook,\nDelaying its forceful spleen\nWith many a wind and crook\nThrough rock to the broad ravine.\nBy the hyacinth-bells in the brakes,\nAnd the shade-loved white windflower, half hid,\nAnd the sun-loving lizards and snakes\nOn the cleft's barren ledges, that slid\nOut of sight, smooth as waterdrops, all,\nAt a snap of twig or bark\nIn the track of the foreign foot-fall,\nShe climbed to the pineforest dark,\nOverbrowing an emerald chine\nOf the grass-billows. Thence, as a wreath,\nRunning poplar and cypress to pine,\nThe lake-banks are seen, and beneath,\nVineyard, village, groves, rivers, towers, farms,\nThe citadel watching the bay,\nThe bay with the town in its arms,\nThe town shining white as the spray\nOf the sapphire sea-wave on the rock,\nWhere the rock stars the girdle of sea,\nWhite-ringed, as the midday flock,\nClipped by heat, rings the round of the tree.\nThat hour of the piercing shaft\nTransfixes bough-shadows, confused\nIn veins of fire, and she laughed,\nWith her quiet mouth amused\nTo see the whole flock, adroop,\nAsleep, hug the tree-stem as one,\nImperceptibly filling the loop\nOf its shade at a slant of sun.\nThe pipes under pent of the crag,\nWhere the goatherds in piping recline,\nHave whimsical stops, burst and flag\nUncorrected as outstretched swine:\nFor the fingers are slack and unsure,\nAnd the wind issues querulous:- thorns\nAnd snakes!--but she listened demure,\nComparing day's music with morn's.\nOf the gentle spirit that slips\nFrom the bark of the tree she discoursed,\nAnd of her of the wells, whose lips\nAre coolness enchanting, rock-sourced.\nAnd much of the sacred loon,\nThe frolic, the Goatfoot God,\nFor stories of indolent noon\nIn the pineforest's odorous nod,\nShe questioned, not knowing: he can\nBe waspish, irascible, rude,\nHe is oftener friendly to man,\nAnd ever to beasts and their brood.\nFor the which did she love him well,\nShe said, and his pipes of the reed,\nHis twitched lips puffing to tell\nIn music his tears and his need,\nAgainst the sharp catch of his hurt.\nNot as shepherds of Pan did she speak,\nNor spake as the schools, to divert,\nBut fondly, perceiving him weak\nBefore Gods, and to shepherds a fear,\nA holiness, horn and heel.\nAll this she had learnt in her ear\nFrom Callistes, and taught him to feel.\nYea, the solemn divinity flushed\nThrough the shaggy brown skin of the beast,\nAnd the steeps where the cataract rushed,\nAnd the wilds where the forest is priest,\nWere his temple to clothe him in awe,\nWhile she spake: 'twas a wonder: she read\nThe haunts of the beak and the claw\nAs plain as the land of bread,\nBut Cities and martial States,\nWhither soon the youth veered his theme,\nWere impervious barrier-gates\nTo her: and that ship, a trireme,\nNearing harbour, scarce wakened her glance,\nThough he dwelt on the message it bore\nOf sceptre and sword and lance\nTo the bee-swarms black on the shore,\nWhich were audible almost,\nSo black they were. It befel\nThat he called up the warrior host\nOf the Song pouring hydromel\nIn thunder, the wide-winged Song.\nAnd he named with his boyish pride\nThe heroes, the noble throng\nPast Acheron now, foul tide!\nWith his joy of the godlike band\nAnd the verse divine, he named\nThe chiefs pressing hot on the strand,\nSeen of Gods, of Gods aided, and maimed.\nThe fleetfoot and ireful; the King;\nHim, the prompter in stratagem,\nMany-shifted and masterful: Sing,\nO Muse! But she cried: Not of them\nShe breathed as if breath had failed,\nAnd her eyes, while she bade him desist,\nHeld the lost-to-light ghosts grey-mailed,\nAs you see the grey river-mist\nHold shapes on the yonder bank.\nA moment her body waned,\nThe light of her sprang and sank:\nThen she looked at the sun, she regained\nClear feature, and she breathed deep.\nShe wore the wan smile he had seen,\nAs the flow of the river of Sleep,\nOn the mouth of the Shadow-Queen.\nIn sunlight she craved to bask,\nSaying: Life! And who was she? who?\nOf what issue? He dared not ask,\nFor that partly he knew.\nVIII\nA noise of the hollow ground\nTurned the eye to the ear in debate:\nNot the soft overflowing of sound\nOf the pines, ranked, lofty, straight,\nBarely swayed to some whispers remote,\nSome swarming whispers above:\nNot the pines with the faint airs afloat,\nHush-hushing the nested dove:\nIt was not the pines, or the rout\nOft heard from mid-forest in chase,\nBut the long muffled roar of a shout\nSubterranean. Sharp grew her face.\nShe rose, yet not moved by affright;\n'Twas rather good haste to use\nHer holiday of delight\nIn the beams of the God of the Muse.\nAnd the steeps of the forest she crossed,\nOn its dry red sheddings and cones\nUp the paths by roots green-mossed,\nSpotted amber, and old mossed stones.\nThen out where the brook-torrent starts\nTo her leap, and from bend to curve\nA hurrying elbow darts\nFor the instant-glancing swerve,\nDecisive, with violent will\nIn the action formed, like hers,\nThe maiden's, ascending; and still\nAscending, the bud of the furze,\nThe broom, and all blue-berried shoots\nOf stubborn and prickly kind,\nThe juniper flat on its roots,\nThe dwarf rhododaphne, behind\nShe left, and the mountain sheep\nFar behind, goat, herbage and flower.\nThe island was hers, and the deep,\nAll heaven, a golden hour.\nThen with wonderful voice, that rang\nThrough air as the swan's nigh death,\nOf the glory of Light she sang,\nShe sang of the rapture of Breath.\nNor ever, says he who heard,\nHeard Earth in her boundaries broad,\nFrom bosom of singer or bird\nA sweetness thus rich of the God\nWhose harmonies always are sane.\nShe sang of furrow and seed,\nThe burial, birth of the grain,\nThe growth, and the showers that feed,\nAnd the green blades waxing mature\nFor the husbandman's armful brown.\nO, the song in its burden ran pure,\nAnd burden to song was a crown.\nCallistes, a singer, skilled\nIn the gift he could measure and praise,\nBy a rival's art was thrilled,\nThough she sang but a Song of Days,\nWhere the husbandman's toil and strife\nLittle varies to strife and toil:\nBut the milky kernel of life,\nWith her numbered: corn, wine, fruit, oil\nThe song did give him to eat:\nGave the first rapt vision of Good,\nAnd the fresh young sense of Sweet\nThe grace of the battle for food,\nWith the issue Earth cannot refuse\nWhen men to their labour are sworn.\n'Twas a song of the God of the Muse\nTo the forehead of Morn.\nIX\nHim loved she. Lo, now was he veiled:\nOver sea stood a swelled cloud-rack:\nThe fishing-boat heavenward sailed,\nBent abeam, with a whitened track,\nSurprised, fast hauling the net,\nAs it flew: sea dashed, earth shook.\nShe said: Is it night? O not yet!\nWith a travail of thoughts in her look.\nThe mountain heaved up to its peak:\nSea darkened: earth gathered her fowl;\nOf bird or of branch rose the shriek.\nNight? but never so fell a scowl\nWore night, nor the sky since then\nWhen ocean ran swallowing shore,\nAnd the Gods looked down for men.\nBroke tempest with that stern roar\nNever yet, save when black on the whirl\nRode wrath of a sovereign Power.\nThen the youth and the shuddering girl,\nDim as shades in the angry shower,\nJoined hands and descended a maze\nOf the paths that were racing alive\nRound boulder and bush, cleaving ways,\nIncessant, with sound of a hive.\nThe height was a fountain-urn\nPouring streams, and the whole solid height\nLeaped, chasing at every turn\nThe pair in one spirit of flight\nTo the folding pineforest. Yet here,\nLike the pause to things hunted, in doubt,\nThe stillness bred spectral fear\nOf the awfulness ranging without,\nAnd imminent. Downward they fled,\nFrom under the haunted roof,\nTo the valley aquake with the tread\nOf an iron-resounding hoof,\nAs of legions of thunderful horse\nBroken loose and in line tramping hard.\nFor the rage of a hungry force\nRoamed blind of its mark over sward:\nThey saw it rush dense in the cloak\nOf its travelling swathe of steam;\nAll the vale through a thin thread-smoke\nWas thrown back to distance extreme:\nAnd dull the full breast of it blinked,\nLike a buckler of steel breathed o'er,\nDiminished, in strangeness distinct,\nGlowing cold, unearthly, hoar:\nAn Enna of fields beyond sun,\nOut of light, in a lurid web;\nAnd the traversing fury spun\nUp and down with a wave's flow and ebb;\nAs the wave breaks to grasp and to spurn,\nRetire, and in ravenous greed,\nInveterate, swell its return.\nUp and down, as if wringing from speed\nSights that made the unsighted appear,\nDelude and dissolve, on it scoured.\nLo, a sea upon land held career\nThrough the plain of the vale half-devoured.\nCallistes of home and escape\nMuttered swiftly, unwitting of speech.\nShe gazed at the Void of shape,\nShe put her white hand to his reach,\nSaying: Now have we looked on the Three.\nAnd divided from day, from night,\nFrom air that is breath, stood she,\nLike the vale, out of light.\nX\nThen again in disorderly words\nHe muttered of home, and was mute,\nWith the heart of the cowering birds\nEre they burst off the fowler's foot.\nHe gave her some redness that streamed\nThrough her limbs in a flitting glow.\nThe sigh of our life she seemed,\nThe bliss of it clothing in woe.\nFrailer than flower when the round\nOf the sickle encircles it: strong\nTo tell of the things profound,\nOur inmost uttering song,\nUnspoken. So stood she awhile\nIn the gloom of the terror afield,\nAnd the silence about her smile\nSaid more than of tongue is revealed.\nI have breathed: I have gazed: I have been:\nIt said: and not joylessly shone\nThe remembrance of light through the screen\nOf a face that seemed shadow and stone.\nShe led the youth trembling, appalled,\nTo the lake-banks he saw sink and rise\nLike a panic-struck breast.

Now was she gone\nWith the Silent, the God without tear,\nLike a bud peeping out of its sheath\nTo be sundered and stamped with the sere.\nAnd Callistes to her beneath,\nAs she to our beams, extinct,\nStrained arms: he was shade of her shade.\nIn division so were they linked.\nBut the song which had betrayed\nHer flight to the cavernous ear\nFor its own keenly wakeful: that song\nOf the sowing and reaping, and cheer\nOf the husbandman's heart made strong\nThrough droughts and deluging rains\nWith his faith in the Great Mother's love:\nO the joy of the breath she sustains,\nAnd the lyre of the light above,\nAnd the first rapt vision of Good,\nAnd the fresh young sense of Sweet:\nThat song the youth ever pursued\nIn the track of her footing fleet.\nFor men to be profited much\nBy her day upon earth did he sing:\nOf her voice, and her steps, and her touch\nOn the blossoms of tender Spring,\nImmortal: and how in her soul\nShe is with them, and tearless abides,\nFolding grain of a love for one goal\nIn patience, past flowing of tides.\nAnd if unto him she was tears,\nHe wept not: he wasted within:\nSeeming sane in the song, to his peers,\nOnly crazed where the cravings begin.\nOur Lady of Gifts prized he less\nThan her issue in darkness: the dim\nLost Skiegencia's caress\nOf our earth made it richest for him.\nAnd for that was a curse on him raised,\nAnd he withered rathe, dry to his prime,\nThough the bounteous Giver be praised\nThrough the island with rites of old time\nExceedingly fervent, and reaped\nVeneration for teachings devout,\nPious hymns when the corn-sheaves are heaped\nAnd the wine-presses ruddily spout,\nAnd the olive and apple are juice\nAt a touch light as hers lost below.\nWhatsoever to men is of use\nSprang his worship of them who bestow,\nIn a measure of songs unexcelled:\nBut that soul loving earth and the sun\nFrom her home of the shadows he held\nFor his beacon where beam there is none:\nAnd to join her, or have her brought back,\nIn his frenzy the singer would call,\nTill he followed where never was track,\nOn the path trod of all.",

    "And now to what remains!- Since I've resolved\nBy what arrangements all things come to pass\nThrough the blue regions of the mighty world,-\nHow we can know what energy and cause\nStarted the various courses of the sun\nAnd the moon's goings, and by what far means\nThey can succumb, the while with thwarted light,\nAnd veil with shade the unsuspecting lands,\nWhen, as it were, they blink, and then again\nWith open eye survey all regions wide,\nResplendent with white radiance- I do now\nReturn unto the world's primeval age\nAnd tell what first the soft young fields of earth\nWith earliest parturition had decreed\nTo raise in air unto the shores of light\nAnd to entrust unto the wayward winds.\nIn the beginning, earth gave forth, around\nThe hills and over all the length of plains,\nThe race of grasses and the shining green;\nThe flowery meadows sparkled all aglow\nWith greening colour, and thereafter, lo,\nUnto the divers kinds of trees was given\nAn emulous impulse mightily to shoot,\nWith a free rein, aloft into the air.\nAs feathers and hairs and bristles are begot\nThe first on members of the four-foot breeds\nAnd on the bodies of the strong-y-winged,\nThus then the new Earth first of all put forth\nGrasses and shrubs, and afterward begat\nThe mortal generations, there upsprung-\nInnumerable in modes innumerable-\nAfter diverging fashions. For from sky\nThese breathing-creatures never can have dropped,\nNor the land-dwellers ever have come up\nOut of sea-pools of salt. How true remains,\nHow merited is that adopted name\nOf earth- \"The Mother!\"- since from out the earth\nAre all begotten. And even now arise\nFrom out the loams how many living things-\nConcreted by the rains and heat of the sun.\nWherefore 'tis less a marvel, if they sprang\nIn Long Ago more many, and more big,\nMatured of those days in the fresh young years\nOf earth and ether. First of all, the race\nOf the winged ones and parti-coloured birds,\nHatched out in spring-time, left their eggs behind;\nAs now-a-days in summer tree-crickets\nDo leave their shiny husks of own accord,\nSeeking their food and living. Then it was\nThis earth of thine first gave unto the day\nThe mortal generations; for prevailed\nAmong the fields abounding hot and wet.\nAnd hence, where any fitting spot was given,\nThere 'gan to grow womb-cavities, by roots\nAffixed to earth. And when in ripened time\nThe age of the young within (that sought the air\nAnd fled earth's damps) had burst these wombs, O then\nWould Nature thither turn the pores of earth\nAnd make her spurt from open veins a juice\nLike unto milk; even as a woman now\nIs filled, at child-bearing, with the sweet milk,\nBecause all that swift stream of aliment\nIs thither turned unto the mother-breasts.\nThere earth would furnish to the children food;\nWarmth was their swaddling cloth, the grass their bed\nAbounding in soft down. Earth's newness then\nWould rouse no dour spells of the bitter cold,\nNor extreme heats nor winds of mighty powers-\nFor all things grow and gather strength through time\nIn like proportions; and then earth was young.\nWherefore, again, again, how merited\nIs that adopted name of Earth- The Mother!-\nSince she herself begat the human race,\nAnd at one well-nigh fixed time brought forth\nEach breast that ranges raving round about\nUpon the mighty mountains and all birds\nAerial with many a varied shape.\nBut, lo, because her bearing years must end,\nShe ceased, like to a woman worn by eld.\nFor lapsing aeons change the nature of\nThe whole wide world, and all things needs must take\nOne status after other, nor aught persists\nForever like itself. All things depart;\nNature she changeth all, compelleth all\nTo transformation. Lo, this moulders down,\nA-slack with weary eld, and that, again,\nProspers in glory, issuing from contempt.\nIn suchwise, then, the lapsing aeons change\nThe nature of the whole wide world, and earth\nTaketh one status after other. And what\nShe bore of old, she now can bear no longer,\nAnd what she never bore, she can to-day.\nIn those days also the telluric world\nStrove to beget the monsters that upsprung\nWith their astounding visages and limbs-\nThe Man-woman- a thing betwixt the twain,\nYet neither, and from either sex remote-\nSome gruesome Boggles orphaned of the feet,\nSome widowed of the hands, dumb Horrors too\nWithout a mouth, or blind Ones of no eye,\nOr Bulks all shackled by their legs and arms\nCleaving unto the body fore and aft,\nThuswise, that never could they do or go,\nNor shun disaster, nor take the good they would.\nAnd other prodigies and monsters earth\nWas then begetting of this sort- in vain,\nSince Nature banned with horror their increase,\nAnd powerless were they to reach unto\nThe coveted flower of fair maturity,\nOr to find aliment, or to intertwine\nIn works of Venus. For we see there must\nConcur in life conditions manifold,\nIf life is ever by begetting life\nTo forge the generations one by one:\nFirst, foods must be; and, next, a path whereby\nThe seeds of impregnation in the frame\nMay ooze, released from the members all;\nLast, the possession of those instruments\nWhereby the male with female can unite,\nThe one with other in mutual ravishments.\nAnd in the ages after monsters died,\nPerforce there perished many a stock, unable\nBy propagation to forge a progeny.\nFor whatsoever creatures thou beholdest\nBreathing the breath of life, the same have been\nEven from their earliest age preserved alive\nBy cunning, or by valour, or at least\nBy speed of foot or wing. And many a stock\nRemaineth yet, because of use to man,\nAnd so committed to man's guardianship.\nValour hath saved alive fierce lion-breeds\nAnd many another terrorizing race,\nCunning the foxes, flight the antlered stags.\nLight-sleeping dogs with faithful heart in breast,\nHowever, and every kind begot from seed\nOf beasts of draft, as, too, the woolly flocks\nAnd horned cattle, all, my Memmius,\nHave been committed to guardianship of men.\nFor anxiously they fled the savage beasts,\nAnd peace they sought and their abundant foods,\nObtained with never labours of their own,\nWhich we secure to them as fit rewards\nFor their good service. But those beasts to whom\nNature has granted naught of these same things-\nBeasts quite unfit by own free will to thrive\nAnd vain for any service unto us\nIn thanks for which we should permit their kind\nTo feed and be in our protection safe-\nThose, of a truth, were wont to be exposed,\nEnshackled in the gruesome bonds of doom,\nAs prey and booty for the rest, until\nNature reduced that stock to utter death.\nBut Centaurs ne'er have been, nor can there be\nCreatures of twofold stock and double frame,\nCompact of members alien in kind,\nYet formed with equal function, equal force\nIn every bodily part- a fact thou mayst,\nHowever dull thy wits, well learn from this:\nThe horse, when his three years have rolled away,\nFlowers in his prime of vigour; but the boy\nNot so, for oft even then he gropes in sleep\nAfter the milky nipples of the breasts,\nAn infant still. And later, when at last\nThe lusty powers of horses and stout limbs,\nNow weak through lapsing life, do fail with age,\nLo, only then doth youth with flowering years\nBegin for boys, and clothe their ruddy cheeks\nWith the soft down. So never deem, percase,\nThat from a man and from the seed of horse,\nThe beast of draft, can Centaurs be composed\nOr e'er exist alive, nor Scyllas be-\nThe half-fish bodies girdled with mad dogs-\nNor others of this sort, in whom we mark\nMembers discordant each with each; for ne'er\nAt one same time they reach their flower of age\nOr gain and lose full vigour of their frame,\nAnd never burn with one same lust of love,\nAnd never in their habits they agree,\nNor find the same foods equally delightsome-\nSooth, as one oft may see the bearded goats\nBatten upon the hemlock which to man\nIs violent poison. Once again, since flame\nIs wont to scorch and burn the tawny bulks\nOf the great lions as much as other kinds\nOf flesh and blood existing in the lands,\nHow could it be that she, Chimaera lone,\nWith triple body- fore, a lion she;\nAnd aft, a dragon; and betwixt, a goat-\nMight at the mouth from out the body belch\nInfuriate flame? Wherefore, the man who feigns\nSuch beings could have been engendered\nWhen earth was new and the young sky was fresh\n(Basing his empty argument on new)\nMay babble with like reason many whims\nInto our ears: he'll say, perhaps, that then\nRivers of gold through every landscape flowed,\nThat trees were wont with precious stones to flower,\nOr that in those far aeons man was born\nWith such gigantic length and lift of limbs\nAs to be able, based upon his feet,\nDeep oceans to bestride; or with his hands\nTo whirl the firmament around his head.\nFor though in earth were many seeds of things\nIn the old time when this telluric world\nFirst poured the breeds of animals abroad,\nStill that is nothing of a sign that then\nSuch hybrid creatures could have been begot\nAnd limbs of all beasts heterogeneous\nHave been together knit; because, indeed,\nThe divers kinds of grasses and the grains\nAnd the delightsome trees- which even now\nSpring up abounding from within the earth-\nCan still ne'er be begotten with their stems\nBegrafted into one; but each sole thing\nProceeds according to its proper wont\nAnd all conserve their own distinctions based\nIn Nature's fixed decree.",
    "Mr. Blake was a regular out-and-out hardened sinner,\nWho was quite out of the pale of Christianity, so to speak,\nHe was in the habit of smoking a long pipe and drinking a glass of\ngrog on a Sunday after dinner,\nAnd seldom thought of going to church more than twice or - if Good\nFriday or Christmas Day happened to come in it - three times a\nweek.\nHe was quite indifferent as to the particular kinds of dresses\nThat the clergyman wore at church where he used to go to pray,\nAnd whatever he did in the way of relieving a chap's distresses,\nHe always did in a nasty, sneaking, underhanded, hole-and-corner\nsort of way.\nI have known him indulge in profane, ungentlemanly emphatics,\nWhen the Protestant Church has been divided on the subject of the\nproper width of a chasuble's hem;\nI have even known him to sneer at albs - and as for dalmatics,\nWords can't convey an idea of the contempt he expressed for THEM.\nHe didn't believe in persons who, not being well off themselves,\nare obliged to confine their charitable exertions to collecting\nmoney from wealthier people,\nAnd looked upon individuals of the former class as ecclesiastical\nhawks;\nHe used to say that he would no more think of interfering with his\npriest's robes than with his church or his steeple,\nAnd that he did not consider his soul imperilled because somebody\nover whom he had no influence whatever, chose to dress himself up\nlike an exaggerated GUY FAWKES.\nThis shocking old vagabond was so unutterably shameless\nThat he actually went a-courting a very respectable and pious\nmiddle-aged sister, by the name of BIGGS.\nShe was a rather attractive widow, whose life as such had always\nbeen particularly blameless;\nHer first husband had left her a secure but moderate competence,\nowing to some fortunate speculations in the matter of figs.\nShe was an excellent person in every way - and won the respect even\nof MRS. GRUNDY,\nShe was a good housewife, too, and wouldn't have wasted a penny if\nshe had owned the Koh-i-noor.\nShe was just as strict as he was lax in her observance of Sunday,\nAnd being a good economist, and charitable besides, she took all\nthe bones and cold potatoes and broken pie-crusts and candle-ends\n(when she had quite done with them), and made them into an\nexcellent soup for the deserving poor.\nI am sorry to say that she rather took to BLAKE - that outcast of\nsociety,\nAnd when respectable brothers who were fond of her began to look\ndubious and to cough,\nShe would say, \"Oh, my friends, it's because I hope to bring this\npoor benighted soul back to virtue and propriety,\nAnd besides, the poor benighted soul, with all his faults, was\nuncommonly well off.\nAnd when MR. BLAKE'S dissipated friends called his attention to the\nfrown or the pout of her,\nWhenever he did anything which appeared to her to savour of an\nunmentionable place,\nHe would say that \"she would be a very decent old girl when all\nthat nonsense was knocked out of her,\"\nAnd his method of knocking it out of her is one that covered him\nwith disgrace.\nShe was fond of going to church services four times every Sunday,\nand, four or five times in the week, and never seemed to pall of\nthem,\nSo he hunted out all the churches within a convenient distance that\nhad services at different hours, so to speak;\nAnd when he had married her he positively insisted upon their going\nto all of them,\nSo they contrived to do about twelve churches every Sunday, and, if\nthey had luck, from twenty-two to twenty-three in the course of the\nweek.\nShe was fond of dropping his sovereigns ostentatiously into the\nplate, and she liked to see them stand out rather conspicuously\nagainst the commonplace half-crowns and shillings,\nSo he took her to all the charity sermons, and if by any\nextraordinary chance there wasn't a charity sermon anywhere, he\nwould drop a couple of sovereigns (one for him and one for her)\ninto the poor-box at the door;\nAnd as he always deducted the sums thus given in charity from the\nhousekeeping money, and the money he allowed her for her bonnets\nand frillings,\nShe soon began to find that even charity, if you allow it to\ninterfere with your personal luxuries, becomes an intolerable bore.\nOn Sundays she was always melancholy and anything but good society,\nFor that day in her household was a day of sighings and sobbings\nand wringing of hands and shaking of heads:\nShe wouldn't hear of a button being sewn on a glove, because it was\na work neither of necessity nor of piety,\nAnd strictly prohibited her servants from amusing themselves, or\nindeed doing anything at all except dusting the drawing-rooms,\ncleaning the boots and shoes, cooking the parlour dinner, waiting\ngenerally on the family, and making the beds.\nBut BLAKE even went further than that, and said that people should\ndo their own works of necessity, and not delegate them to persons\nin a menial situation,\nSo he wouldn't allow his servants to do so much as even answer a\nbell.\nHere he is making his wife carry up the water for her bath to the\nsecond floor, much against her inclination, -\nAnd why in the world the gentleman who illustrates these ballads\nhas put him in a cocked hat is more than I can tell.\nAfter about three months of this sort of thing, taking the smooth\nwith the rough of it,\n(Blacking her own boots and peeling her own potatoes was not her\nnotion of connubial bliss),\nMRS. BLAKE began to find that she had pretty nearly had enough of\nit,\nAnd came, in course of time, to think that BLAKE'S own original\nline of conduct wasn't so much amiss.\nAnd now that wicked person - that detestable sinner (\"BELIAL BLAKE\"\nhis friends and well-wishers call him for his atrocities),\nAnd his poor deluded victim, whom all her Christian brothers\ndislike and pity so,\nGo to the parish church only on Sunday morning and afternoon and\noccasionally on a week-day, and spend their evenings in connubial\nfondlings and affectionate reciprocities,\nAnd I should like to know where in the world (or rather, out of it)\nthey expect to go!",

    "Lieutenant De Long, commanding the Jeannette Artic\nExpedition, having seen his vessel crushed by the ice,\nundertook a perilous journey through the ice and snow\ntoward the coast of Siberia.

    "Then a ploughman said, \"Speak to us of Work.\"\nAnd he answered, saying:\nYou work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth.\nFor to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, and to step out of life's procession, that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite.\nWhen you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music.\nWhich of you would be a reed, dumb and silent, when all else sings together in unison?\nAlways you have been told that work is a curse and labour a misfortune.\nBut I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth's furthest dream, assigned to you when that dream was born,\nAnd in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life,\nAnd to love life through labour is to be intimate with life's inmost secret.\nBut if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of the flesh a curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught but the sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written.\nYou have been told also life is darkness, and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary.\nAnd I say that life is indeed darkness save when there is urge,\nAnd all urge is blind save when there is knowledge,\nAnd all knowledge is vain save when there is work,\nAnd all work is empty save when there is love;\nAnd when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another, and to God.\nAnd what is it to work with love?\nIt is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth.\nIt is to build a house with affection, even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house.\nIt is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit.\nIt is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit,\nAnd to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and watching.\nOften have I heard you say, as if speaking in sleep, \"he who works in marble, and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone, is a nobler than he who ploughs the soil.\nAnd he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man, is more than he who makes the sandals for our feet.\"\nBut I say, not in sleep but in the over-wakefulness of noontide, that the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of all the blades of grass;\nAnd he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song made sweeter by his own loving.\nWork is love made visible.\nAnd if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy.\nFor if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man's hunger.\nAnd if you grudge the crushing of the grapes, your grudge distills a poison in the wine.\nAnd if you sing though as angels, and love not the singing, you muffle man's ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night.",

    "It's when the birds go piping and the daylight slowly breaks,\nThat, clamoring for his dinner, our precious baby wakes;\nThen it's sleep no more for baby, and it's sleep no more for me,\nFor, when he wants his dinner, why it's dinner it must be!\nAnd of that lacteal fluid he partakes with great ado,\nWhile gran'ma laughs,\nAnd gran'pa laughs,\nAnd wife, she laughs,\nAnd I - well, I laugh, too!\nYou'd think, to see us carrying on about that little tad,\nThat, like as not, that baby was the first we'd ever had;\nBut, sakes alive! he isn't, yet we people make a fuss\nAs if the only baby in the world had come to us!\nAnd, morning, noon, and night-time, whatever he may do,\nGran'ma, she laughs,\nGran'pa, he laughs,\nWife, she laughs,\nAnd I, of course, laugh, too!\nBut once - a likely spell ago - when that poor little chick\nFrom teething or from some such ill of infancy fell sick,\nYou wouldn't know us people as the same that went about\nA-feelin' good all over, just to hear him crow and shout;\nAnd, though the doctor poohed our fears and said he'd pull him through,\nOld gran'ma cried,\nAnd gran'pa cried,\nAnd wife, she cried,\nAnd I - yes, I cried, too!\nIt makes us all feel good to have a baby on the place,\nWith his everlastin' crowing and his dimpling, dumpling face;\nThe patter of his pinky feet makes music everywhere,\nAnd when he shakes those fists of his, good-by to every care!\nNo matter what our trouble is, when he begins to coo,\nOld gran'ma laughs,\nAnd gran'pa laughs,\nWife, she laughs,\nAnd I - you bet, I laugh, too!",

Then he would rise\nWith an effort as heartfelt as a decision\nTo get out of bed on Sunday and carefully\nRelocate his center of gravity\nAbove and beyond an imaginary axis\nBetween his feet and carry the good news\nAlong the path and the sidewalk, well on his way\nTo readjusting the business of the earth.",

Ah no,\nThese sights are for the earth and open sky,\nAnd your loud wheels unheeded rattle by.",

    "I was born and reared in Southern Illinois. That region of Illinois then a part of the Segregated South. The schools I attended were not as functional as those the white kids enjoyed. Appreciating movies at the local Roxy Theatre required a lonely climb upstairs to the balcony. I've sipped water from fountains designated 'Negro Only, ' and well remember the 'Colored' signs at the rear of the 'Tri-City' bus. At an advanced age, in the center of one of the World's most renowned regions, where least expected, I've heard the disparaging word 'nigger' directed my way on separate occasions.\nAs an activated USMC Reservist during the Korean Conflict, I was deployed to Parris Island, South Carolina. Arriving in Beaufort soon after daybreak, famished, amid thoughts centered on an uncertain future, I was oblivious to the cultural mores around me. Dressed in full military regalia, toting a fully packed sea-bag, I entered the nearest restaurant seeking a mere breakfast meal. I was met at the door with words I shall never forget, 'We don't serve Colored People here.' My Country had just ordered me to submit my life to protect it, with death if necessary, yet found it convenient to deny me a decent meal in a comfortable setting.\nRacial insensitivity, once experienced, remains indelibly ingrained, precisely defining bigotry whenever and wherever it appears. I've seen its presence in proliferated acts of political expediency. Known it denied in spite of the critical obvious. Have witnessed those who claim to abhor the practice, sit silently in tacit approval. Folks who observe, yet fail to condemn are as culpable, I'm convinced, as any committing the overt act.\nRacism - Just Another Word..'Til Once Experienced",

    "Ye sons of Germany, your noble Emperor William now is dead.\nWho oft great armies to battle hath led;\nHe was a man beloved by his subjects all,\nBecause he never tried them to enthral.\nThe people of Germany have cause now to mourn,\nThe loss of their hero, who to them will ne'er return;\nBut his soul I hope to Heaven has fled away,\nTo the realms of endless bliss for ever and aye.\nHe was much respected throughout Europe by the high and the low,\nAnd all over Germany people's hearts are full of woe;\nFor in the battlefield he was a hero bold,\nNevertheless, a lover of peace, to his credit be it told.\n'Twas in the year of 1888, and on March the 16th day,\nThat the peaceful William's remains were conveyed away\nTo the royal mausoleum of Charlottenburg, their last resting-place,\nThe God-fearing man that never did his country disgrace.\nThe funeral service was conducted in the cathedral by the court chaplain, Dr. Kogel,\nWhich touched the hearts of his hearers, as from his lips it fell,\nAnd in conclusion he recited the Lord's Prayer\nIn the presence of kings, princes, dukes, and counts assembled there.\nAnd at the end of the service the infantry outside fired volley after volley,\nWhile the people inside the cathedral felt melancholy,\nAs the sound of the musketry smote upon the ear,\nIn honour of the illustrous William, whom they loved most dear.\nThen there was a solemn pause as the kings and princes took their places,\nWhilst the hot tears are trickling down their faces,\nAnd the mourners from shedding tears couldn't refrain;\nAnd in respect of the good man, above the gateway glared a bituminous flame.\nThen the coffin was placed on the funeral car,\nBy the kings and princes that came from afar;\nAnd the Crown Prince William heads the procession alone,\nWhile behind him are the four heirs-apparent to the throne.\nThen followed the three Kings of Saxony, and the King of the Belgians also,\nTogether with the Prince of Wales, with their hearts full of woe,\nBesides the Prince of Naples and Prince Rudolph of Austria were there,\nAlso the Czarevitch, and other princes in their order I do declare.\nAnd as the procession passes the palace the blinds are drawn completely,\nAnd every house is half hidden with the sable drapery;\nAnd along the line of march expansive arches were erected,\nWhile the spectators standing by seemed very dejected.\nAnd through the Central Avenue, to make the decorations complete,\nThere were pedestals erected, rising fourteen to fifteen feet,\nAnd at the foot and top of each pedestal were hung decorations of green bay,\nAlso beautiful wreaths and evergreen festoons all in grand array.\nAnd there were torches fastened on pieces of wood stuck in the ground;\nAnd as the people gazed on the weird-like scene, their silence was profound;\nAnd the shopkeepers closed their shops, and hotel-keepers closed in the doorways,\nAnd with torchlight and gaslight, Berlin for once was all ablaze.\nThe authorities of Berlin in honour of the Emperor considered it no sin,\nTo decorate with crape the beautiful city of Berlin;\nTherefore Berlin I declare was a city of crape,\nBecause few buildings crape decoration did escape.\nFirst in the procession was the Emperor's bodyguard,\nAnd his great love for them nothing could it retard;\nThen followed a squadron of the hussars with their band,\nPlaying \"Jesus, Thou my Comfort,\" most solemn and grand.\nAnd to see the procession passing the sightseers tried their best,\nEspecially when the cavalry hove in sight, riding four abreast;\nMen and officers with their swords drawn, a magnificent sight to see\nIn the dim sun's rays, their burnished swords glinting dimly.\nThen followed the footguards with slow and solemn tread,\nPlaying the \"Dead March in Saul,\" most appropriate for the dead;\nAnd behind them followed the artillery, with four guns abreast,\nAlso the ministers and court officials dressed in their best.\nThe whole distance to the grave was covered over with laurel and bay,\nSo that the body should be borne along smoothly all the way;\nAnd the thousands of banners in the procession were beautiful to view,\nBecause they were composed of cream-coloured silk and light blue.\nThere were thousands of thousands of men and women gathered there,\nAnd standing ankle deep in snow, and seemingly didn't care\nSo as they got a glimpse of the funeral car,\nEspecially the poor souls that came from afar.\nAnd when the funeral car appeared there was a general hush,\nAnd the spectators in their anxiety to see began to crush;\nAnd when they saw the funeral car by the Emperor's charger led,\nEvery hat and cap was lifted reverently from off each head.\nAnd as the procession moved on to the royal mausoleum,\nThe spectators remained bareheaded and seemingly quite dumb;\nAnd as the coffin was borne into its last resting-place,\nSorrow seemed depicted in each one's face.\nAnd after the burial service the mourners took a last farewell\nOf the noble-hearted William they loved so well;\nThen rich and poor dispersed quietly that were assembled there,\nWhile two batteries of field-guns fired a salute which did rend the air\nIn honour of the immortal hero they loved so dear,\nThe founder of the Fatherland Germany, that he did revere.",

The young IRA Volunteer who had spent almost the last nine years of his short life in prison as a result of his Irish republican activities was, by the time of his death, world-famous having been elected to the british parliament and having withstood pressures, political and moral (including an emissary from Pope John Paul II) , for him to abandon his fast which was aimed at countering a criminalisation policy by the british government. His name became a household word in Ireland, and his sacrifice (as did that of those who followed him)  overturned british propaganda on Ireland and had a real effect in advancing the cause of Irish freedom.",

    "Know, O dear readers, that the medicine of a disease is to remove the\nroot cause of that disease. Isa (Jesus Christ) -peace be upon him-\nwas once asked: 'What thing is difficult?' He said: 'God's wrath.'\nProphet Yahya (John the Baptist) -peace be upon him- then asked:\n'What thing takes near the wrath of God?' He said:'Anger'. Yahya -\npeace be upon him- asked him:'What thing grows and increases anger?'\nIsa -peace be upon him- said:'Pride, prestige, hope for honour and\nhaughtiness'\nThe causes which cause anger to grow are self-conceit, self-praise,\njests and ridicule, argument, treachery, too much greed for too much\nwealth and name and fame. If these evils are united in a person, his\nconduct becomes bad and he cannot escape anger.\nSo these things should be removed by their opposites. Self-praise is\nto be removed by modesty. Pride is to be removed by one's own origin\nand birth, greed is to be removed by remaining satisfied with\nnecessary things, and miserliness by charity.\nThe prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: 'A strong man is not\nhe who defeats his adversary by wrestling, but a strong man is he who\ncontrols himself at the time of anger.'\nWe are describing below the medicines of anger after one gets angry.\nThe medicine is a mixture of knowledge and action. The medicine based\non knowledge is of six kinds:\n(1) The first medicine of knowledge is to think over the rewards of\nappeasing anger, that have come from the verses of the Quran and the\nsayings of the Prophet (pbuh). Your hope for getting rewards of\nappeasing anger will restrain you from taking revenge.\n(2) The second kind of medicine based on knowledge is to fear the\npunishment of God and to think that the punishment of God upon me is\ngreater than my punishment upon him. If I take revenge upon this man\nfor anger, God will take revenge upon me on the Judgement Day.\n(3) The third kind of medicine of anger based on knowledge is to take\nprecaution about punishment of enmity and revenge on himself. You\nfeel joy in having your enemy in your presence in his sorrows, You\nyourself are not free from that danger. You will fear that your enemy\nmight take revenge against you in this world and in the next.\n(4) Another kind of medicine based on knowledge is to think about the\nugly face of the angry man, which is just like that of the ferocious\nbeast. He who appeases anger looks like a sober and learned man.\n(5) The fifth kind of medicine based on knowledge is to think that the\ndevil will advise by saying: ' You will be weak if you do not get\nangry!' Do not listen to him!\n(6) The sixth reason is to think: ' What reason have I got to get\nangry? What Allah wishes has occurred!'\nMedicine based on action\nWhen you get angry, say: I seek refuge in God from the accursed evil\n(A'oudhou billaahi min as shaytaan ir rajeem). The prophet (pbuh)\nordered us to say thus.\nWhen Ayesha (RA) got angry, he dragged her by the nose and said: ' O\ndear Ayesha, say: O God, you are the Lord of my prophet Muhammad,\nforgive my sins and remove the anger from my heart and save me from\nmisguidance.'\nIf anger does not go by this means, you will sit down if you are\nstanding, lie down if you are sitting, and come near to earth, as you\nhave been created of earth. Thus make yourself calm like the earth.\nThe cause of wrath is heat and its opposite is to lie down on the\nground and to make the body calm and cool.\nThe prophet (pbuh) said: Anger is a burning coal. Don't you see your\neyebrows wide and eyes reddish? So when one of you feels angry, let\nhim sit down if standing, and lie down if sitting.\nIf still anger does not stop, make ablution with cold water or take a\nbath, as fire cannot be extinguished without water.\nThe prophet (pbuh) said : ' When one of you gets angry, let him make\nablution with water as anger arises out of fire.' In another\nnarration, he said:' Anger comes from the devil and the devil is made\nof fire.'\nHazrat Ali (RA) said:\nThe prophet did not get angry for any action of the world. When any\ntrue matter charmed him, nobody knew it and nobody got up to take\nrevenge for his anger. HE GOT ANGRY ONLY FOR TRUTH.",

Now therefore bend thine eare\nTo supplication, heare his sighs though mute;\nUnskilful with what words to pray, let mee\nInterpret for him, mee his Advocate\nAnd propitiation, all his works on mee\nGood or not good ingraft, my Merit those\nShall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.\nAccept me, and in mee from these receave\nThe smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live\nBefore thee reconcil'd, at least his days\nNumberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I\nTo mitigate thus plead, not to reverse)\nTo better life shall yeeld him, where with mee\nAll my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss,\nMade one with me as I with thee am one.\nTo whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.\nAll thy request for Man, accepted Son,\nObtain, all thy request was my Decree:\nBut longer in that Paradise to dwell,\nThe Law I gave to Nature him forbids:\nThose pure immortal Elements that know\nNo gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule,\nEject him tainted now, and purge him off\nAs a distemper, gross to aire as gross,\nAnd mortal food, as may dispose him best\nFor dissolution wrought by Sin, that first\nDistemperd all things, and of incorrupt\nCorrupted. I at first with two fair gifts\nCreated him endowd, with Happiness\nAnd Immortalitie: that fondly lost,\nThis other serv'd but to eternize woe;\nTill I provided Death; so Death becomes\nHis final remedie, and after Life\nTri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd\nBy Faith and faithful works, to second Life,\nWak't in the renovation of the just,\nResignes him up with Heav'n and Earth renewd.\nBut let us call to Synod all the Blest\nThrough Heav'ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide\nMy judgments, how with Mankind I proceed,\nAs how with peccant Angels late they saw;\nAnd in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd.\nHe ended, and the Son gave signal high\nTo the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew\nHis Trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps\nWhen God descended, and perhaps once more\nTo sound at general Doom. Th' Angelic blast\nFilld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs\nOf Amarantin Shade, Fountain or Spring,\nBy the waters of Life, where ere they sate\nIn fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light\nHasted, resorting to the Summons high,\nAnd took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream\nTh' Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will.\nO Sons, like one of us Man is become\nTo know both Good and Evil, since his taste\nOf that defended Fruit; but let him boast\nHis knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,\nHappier, had it suffic'd him to have known\nGood by it self, and Evil not at all.\nHe sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,\nMy motions in him, longer then they move,\nHis heart I know, how variable and vain\nSelf-left. Least therefore his now bolder hand\nReach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,\nAnd live for ever, dream at least to live\nForever, to remove him I decree,\nAnd send him from the Garden forth to Till\nThe Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile.\nMichael, this my behest have thou in charge,\nTake to thee from among the Cherubim\nThy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend\nOr in behalf of Man, or to invade\nVacant possession som new trouble raise:\nHast thee, and from the Paradise of God\nWithout remorse drive out the sinful Pair,\nFrom hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce\nTo them and to thir Progenie from thence\nPerpetual banishment. Yet least they faint\nAt the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd,\nFor I behold them soft'nd and with tears\nBewailing thir excess, all terror hide.\nIf patiently thy bidding they obey,\nDismiss them not disconsolate; reveale\nTo Adam what shall come in future dayes,\nAs I shall thee enlighten, intermix\nMy Cov'nant in the Womans seed renewd;\nSo send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:\nAnd on the East side of the Garden place,\nWhere entrance up from Eden easiest climbes,\nCherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame\nWide waving, all approach farr off to fright,\nAnd guard all passage to the Tree of Life:\nLeast Paradise a receptacle prove\nTo Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,\nWith whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude.\nHe ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd\nFor swift descent, with him the Cohort bright\nOf watchful Cherubim; four faces each\nHad, like a double Janus, all thir shape\nSpangl'd with eyes more numerous then those\nOf Argus, and more wakeful then to drouze,\nCharm'd with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral Reed\nOf Hermes, or his opiate Rod. Meanwhile\nTo resalute the World with sacred Light\nLeucothia wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd\nThe Earth, when Adam and first Matron Eve\nHad ended now thir Orisons, and found,\nStrength added from above, new hope to spring\nOut of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;\nWhich thus to Eve his welcome words renewd.\nEve, easily may Faith admit, that all\nThe good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends\nBut that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n\nSo prevalent as to concerne the mind\nOf God high blest, or to incline his will,\nHard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,\nOr one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne\nEv'n to the Seat of God. For since I saught\nBy Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease,\nKneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart,\nMethought I saw him placable and mild,\nBending his eare; perswasion in me grew\nThat I was heard with favour; peace returnd\nHome to my brest, and to my memorie\nHis promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;\nWhich then not minded in dismay, yet now\nAssures me that the bitterness of death\nIs past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee,\nEve rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind,\nMother of all things living, since by thee\nMan is to live, and all things live for Man.\nTo whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.\nIll worthie I such title should belong\nTo me transgressour, who for thee ordaind\nA help, became thy snare; to mee reproach\nRather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:\nBut infinite in pardon was my Judge,\nThat I who first brought Death on all, am grac't\nThe sourse of life; next favourable thou,\nWho highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't,\nFarr other name deserving. But the Field\nTo labour calls us now with sweat impos'd,\nThough after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,\nAll unconcern'd with our unrest, begins\nHer rosie progress smiling; let us forth,\nI never from thy side henceforth to stray,\nWherere our days work lies, though now enjoind\nLaborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,\nWhat can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?\nHere let us live, though in fall'n state, content.\nSo spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but Fate\nSubscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest\nOn Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd\nAfter short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight\nThe Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour,\nTwo Birds of gayest plume before him drove:\nDown from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,\nFirst Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace,\nGoodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;\nDirect to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.\nAdam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase\nPursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake.\nO Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh,\nWhich Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews\nForerunners of his purpose, or to warn\nUs haply too secure of our discharge\nFrom penaltie, because from death releast\nSome days; how long, and what till then our life,\nWho knows, or more then this, that we are dust,\nAnd thither must return and be no more.\nVVhy else this double object in our sight\nOf flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground\nOne way the self-same hour? why in the East\nDarkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light\nMore orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws\nO're the blew Firmament a radiant white,\nAnd slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught.\nHe err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands\nDown from a Skie of Jasper lighted now\nIn Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,\nA glorious Apparition, had not doubt\nAnd carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams eye.\nNot that more glorious, when the Angels met\nJacob in Mahanaim, where he saw\nThe field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright;\nNor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd\nIn Dothan, cover'd with a Camp of Fire,\nAgainst the Syrian King, who to surprize\nOne man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,\nWarr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch\nIn thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise\nPossession of the Garden; hee alone,\nTo finde where Adam shelterd, took his way,\nNot unperceav'd of Adam, who to Eve,\nWhile the great Visitant approachd, thus spake.\nEve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps\nOf us will soon determin, or impose\nNew Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie\nFrom yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill\nOne of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate\nNone of the meanest, some great Potentate\nOr of the Thrones above, such Majestie\nInvests him coming; yet not terrible,\nThat I should fear, nor sociably mild,\nAs Raphael, that I should much confide,\nBut solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,\nWith reverence I must meet, and thou retire.\nHe ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,\nNot in his shape Celestial, but as Man\nClad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes\nA militarie Vest of purple flowd\nLivelier then Meliboean or the graine\nOf Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old\nIn time of Truce; Iris had dipt the wooff;\nHis starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime\nIn Manhood where Youth ended; by his side\nAs in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword,\nSatans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.\nAdam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State\nInclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd.\nAdam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs:\nSufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,\nThen due by sentence when thou didst transgress,\nDefeated of his seisure many dayes\nGiv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent,\nAnd one bad act with many deeds well done\nMayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd\nRedeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes;\nBut longer in this Paradise to dwell\nPermits not; to remove thee I am come,\nAnd send thee from the Garden forth to till\nThe ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile.\nHe added not, for Adam at the newes\nHeart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,\nThat all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen\nYet all had heard, with audible lament\nDiscover'd soon the place of her retire.\nO unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!\nMust I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave\nThee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,\nFit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,\nQuiet though sad, the respit of that day\nThat must be mortal to us both. O flours,\nThat never will in other Climate grow,\nMy early visitation, and my last\nAt Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand\nFrom the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names,\nWho now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke\nYour Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount?\nThee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd\nWith what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee\nHow shall I part, and whither wander down\nInto a lower World, to this obscure\nAnd wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire\nLess pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?\nWhom thus the Angel interrupted milde.\nLament not Eve, but patiently resigne\nWhat justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,\nThus over fond, on that which is not thine;\nThy going is not lonely, with thee goes\nThy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;\nWhere he abides, think there thy native soile.\nAdam by this from the cold sudden damp\nRecovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,\nTo Michael thus his humble words addressd.\nCelestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd\nOf them the Highest, for such of shape may seem\nPrince above Princes, gently hast thou tould\nThy message, which might else in telling wound,\nAnd in performing end us; what besides\nOf sorrow and dejection and despair\nOur frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,\nDeparture from this happy place, our sweet\nRecess, and onely consolation left\nFamiliar to our eyes, all places else\nInhospitable appeer and desolate,\nNor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer\nIncessant I could hope to change the will\nOf him who all things can, I would not cease\nTo wearie him with my assiduous cries:\nBut prayer against his absolute Decree\nNo more availes then breath against the winde,\nBlown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:\nTherefore to his great bidding I submit.\nThis most afflicts me, that departing hence,\nAs from his face I shall be hid, deprivd\nHis blessed count'nance; here I could frequent,\nWith worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd\nPresence Divine, and to my Sons relate;\nOn this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree\nStood visible, among these Pines his voice\nI heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd:\nSo many grateful Altars I would reare\nOf grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone\nOf lustre from the brook, in memorie,\nOr monument to Ages, and thereon\nOffer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours:\nIn yonder nether World where shall I seek\nHis bright appearances, or footstep trace?\nFor though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd\nTo life prolongd and promisd Race, I now\nGladly behold though but his utmost skirts\nOf glory, and farr off his steps adore.\nTo whom thus Michael with regard benigne.\nAdam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth\nNot this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills\nLand, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,\nFomented by his virtual power and warmd:\nAll th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,\nNo despicable gift; surmise not then\nHis presence to these narrow bounds confin'd\nOf Paradise or Eden: this had been\nPerhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred\nAll generations, and had hither come\nFrom all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate\nAnd reverence thee thir great Progenitor.\nBut this præeminence thou hast lost, brought down\nTo dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:\nYet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine\nGod is as here, and will be found alike\nPresent, and of his presence many a signe\nStill following thee, still compassing thee round\nWith goodness and paternal Love, his Face\nExpress, and of his steps the track Divine.\nWhich that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd,\nEre thou from hence depart, know I am sent\nTo shew thee what shall come in future dayes\nTo thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad\nExpect to hear, supernal Grace contending\nWith sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn\nTrue patience, and to temper joy with fear\nAnd pious sorrow, equally enur'd\nBy moderation either state to beare,\nProsperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead\nSafest thy life, and best prepar'd endure\nThy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend\nThis Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes)\nHere sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st,\nAs once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.\nTo whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd.\nAscend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path\nThou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit,\nHowever chast'ning, to the evil turne\nMy obvious breast, arming to overcom\nBy suffering, and earne rest from labour won,\nIf so I may attain. So both ascend\nIn the Visions of God: It was a Hill\nOf Paradise the highest, from whose top\nThe Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken\nStretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay.\nNot higher that Hill nor wider looking round,\nWhereon for different cause the Tempter set\nOur second Adam in the Wilderness,\nTo shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.\nHis Eye might there command wherever stood\nCity of old or modern Fame, the Seat\nOf mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls\nOf Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can\nAnd Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne,\nTo Paquin of Sinæan Kings, and thence\nTo Agra and Lahor of great Mogul\nDown to the golden Chersonese, or where\nThe Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since\nIn Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar\nIn Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance,\nTurchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken\nTh' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port\nErcoco and the less Maritine Kings\nMombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind,\nAnd Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme\nOf Congo, and Angola fardest South;\nOr thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount\nThe Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez, and Sus,\nMarocco and Algiers, and Tremisen;\nOn Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway\nThe VVorld: in Spirit perhaps he also saw\nRich Mexico the seat of Motezume,\nAnd Cusco in Peru, the richer seat\nOf Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd\nGuiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons\nCall El Dorado: but to nobler sights\nMichael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd\nVVhich that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight\nHad bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue\nThe visual Nerve, for he had much to see;\nAnd from the VVell of Life three drops instill'd.\nSo deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd,\nEevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,\nThat Adam now enforc't to close his eyes,\nSunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:\nBut him the gentle Angel by the hand\nSoon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd.\nAdam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold\nTh' effects which thy original crime hath wrought\nIn some to spring from thee, who never touch'd\nTh' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd,\nNor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive\nCorruption to bring forth more violent deeds.\nHis eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field,\nPart arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves\nNew reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds;\nIth' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood\nRustic, of grassie sord; thither anon\nA sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought\nFirst Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,\nUncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next\nMore meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock\nChoicest and best; then sacrificing, laid\nThe Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd,\nOn the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd.\nHis Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n\nConsum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame;\nThe others not, for his was not sincere;\nWhereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd,\nSmote him into the Midriff with a stone\nThat beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale\nGroand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd.\nMuch at that sight was Adam in his heart\nDismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd.\nO Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n\nTo that meek man, who well had sacrific'd;\nIs Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid?\nT' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd.\nThese two are Brethren, Adam, and to come\nOut of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain,\nFor envie that his Brothers Offering found\nFrom Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact\nWill be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd\nLoose no reward, though here thou see him die,\nRowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire.\nAlas, both for the deed and for the cause!\nBut have I now seen Death? Is this the way\nI must return to native dust? O sight\nOf terrour, foul and ugly to behold,\nHorrid to think, how horrible to feel!\nTo whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen\nIn his first shape on man; but many shapes\nOf Death, and many are the wayes that lead\nTo his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense\nMore terrible at th' entrance then within.\nSome, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die,\nBy Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more\nIn Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring\nDiseases dire, of which a monstrous crew\nBefore thee shall appear; that thou mayst know\nWhat miserie th' inabstinence of Eve\nShall bring on men. Immediately a place\nBefore his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,\nA Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid\nNumbers of all diseas'd, all maladies\nOf gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes\nOf heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,\nConvulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,\nIntestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,\nDropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums.\nDire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair\nTended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;\nAnd over them triumphant Death his Dart\nShook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't\nWith vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.\nSight so deform what heart of Rock could long\nDrie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept,\nThough not of Woman born; compassion quell'd\nHis best of Man, and gave him up to tears\nA space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,\nAnd scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd.\nO miserable Mankind, to what fall\nDegraded, to what wretched state reserv'd?\nBetter end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n\nTo be thus wrested from us? rather why\nObtruded on us thus? who if we knew\nWhat we receive, would either not accept\nLife offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down,\nGlad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus\nTh' Image of God in man created once\nSo goodly and erect, though faultie since,\nTo such unsightly sufferings be debas't\nUnder inhuman pains? Why should not Man,\nRetaining still Divine similitude\nIn part, from such deformities be free,\nAnd for his Makers Image sake exempt?\nThir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then\nForsook them, when themselves they villifi'd\nTo serve ungovern'd appetite, and took\nHis Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice,\nInductive mainly to the sin of Eve.\nTherefore so abject is thir punishment,\nDisfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,\nOr if his likeness, by themselves defac't\nWhile they pervert pure Natures healthful rules\nTo loathsom sickness, worthily, since they\nGods Image did not reverence in themselves.\nI yeild it just, said Adam, and submit.\nBut is there yet no other way, besides\nThese painful passages, how we may come\nTo Death, and mix with our connatural dust?\nThere is, said Michael, if thou well observe\nThe rule of not too much, by temperance taught\nIn what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence\nDue nourishment, not gluttonous delight,\nTill many years over thy head return:\nSo maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop\nInto thy Mothers lap, or be with ease\nGatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:\nThis is old age; but then thou must outlive\nThy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change\nTo witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then\nObtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,\nTo what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth\nHopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne\nA melancholly damp of cold and dry\nTo waigh thy spirits down, and last consume\nThe Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor.\nHenceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong\nLife much, bent rather how I may be quit\nFairest and easiest of this combrous charge,\nWhich I must keep till my appointed day\nOf rendring up. Michael to him repli'd.\nNor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst\nLive well, how long or short permit to Heav'n:\nAnd now prepare thee for another sight.\nHe lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon\nWere Tents of various hue; by some were herds\nOf Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound\nOf Instruments that made melodious chime\nWas heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd\nThir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch\nInstinct through all proportions low and high\nFled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue.\nIn other part stood one who at the Forge\nLabouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass\nHad melted (whether found where casual fire\nHad wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,\nDown to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot\nTo som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream\nFrom underground) the liquid Ore he dreind\nInto fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd\nFirst his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought\nFulfil or grav'n in mettle. After these,\nBut on the hether side a different sort\nFrom the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,\nDown to the Plain descended: by thir guise\nJust men they seemd, and all thir study bent\nTo worship God aright, and know his works\nNot hid, nor those things lost which might preserve\nFreedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain\nLong had not walkt, when from the Tents behold\nA Beavie of fair Women, richly gay\nIn Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung\nSoft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:\nThe Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes\nRove without rein, till in the amorous Net\nFast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose;\nAnd now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star\nLoves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat\nThey light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke\nHymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't;\nWith Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.\nSuch happy interview and fair event\nOf love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,\nAnd charming Symphonies attach'd the heart\nOf Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight,\nThe bent of Nature; which he thus express'd.\nTrue opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,\nMuch better seems this Vision, and more hope\nOf peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;\nThose were of hate and death, or pain much worse,\nHere Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.\nTo whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best\nBy pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,\nCreated, as thou art, to nobler end\nHolie and pure, conformitie divine.\nThose Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents\nOf wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race\nWho slew his Brother; studious they appere\nOf Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,\nUnmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit\nTaught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none.\nYet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;\nFor that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd\nOf Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,\nYet empty of all good wherein consists\nWomans domestic honour and chief praise;\nBred onely and completed to the taste\nOf lustful apperence, to sing, to dance,\nTo dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.\nTo these that sober Race of Men, whose lives\nReligious titl'd them the Sons of God,\nShall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame\nIgnobly, to the trains and to the smiles\nOf these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,\n(Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which\nThe world erelong a world of tears must weepe.\nTo whom thus Adam of short joy bereft.\nO pittie and shame, that they who to live well\nEnterd so faire, should turn aside to tread\nPaths indirect, or in the mid way faint!\nBut still I see the tenor of Mans woe\nHolds on the same, from Woman to begin.\nFrom Mans effeminate slackness it begins,\nSaid th' Angel, who should better hold his place\nBy wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd.\nBut now prepare thee for another Scene.\nHe lookd and saw wide Territorie spred\nBefore him, Towns, and rural works between,\nCities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,\nConcours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,\nGiants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;\nPart wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,\nSingle or in Array of Battel rang'd\nBoth Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;\nOne way a Band select from forage drives\nA herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine\nFrom a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,\nEwes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,\nThir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,\nBut call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray;\nWith cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;\nWhere Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies\nWith Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field\nDeserted: Others to a Citie strong\nLay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine,\nAssaulting; others from the Wall defend\nWith Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;\nOn each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.\nIn other part the scepter'd Haralds call\nTo Council in the Citie Gates: anon\nGrey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,\nAssemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon\nIn factious opposition, till at last\nOf middle Age one rising, eminent\nIn wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,\nOf Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,\nAnd Judgement from above: him old and young\nExploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands,\nHad not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence\nUnseen amid the throng: so violence\nProceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law\nThrough all the Plain, and refuge none was found.\nAdam was all in tears, and to his guide\nLamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,\nDeaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death\nInhumanly to men, and multiply\nTen thousand fould the sin of him who slew\nHis Brother; for of whom such massacher\nMake they but of thir Brethren, men of men?\nBut who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n\nRescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost?\nTo whom thus Michael: These are the product\nOf those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st;\nWhere good with bad were matcht, who of themselves\nAbhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,\nProduce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.\nSuch were these Giants, men of high renown;\nFor in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd,\nAnd Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd;\nTo overcome in Battel, and subdue\nNations, and bring home spoils with infinite\nMan-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch\nOf human Glorie, and for Glorie done\nOf triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours,\nPatrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,\nDestroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men.\nThus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth,\nAnd what most merits fame in silence hid.\nBut hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst\nThe onely righteous in a World perverse,\nAnd therefore hated, therefore so beset\nWith Foes for daring single to be just,\nAnd utter odious Truth, that God would come\nTo judge them with his Saints: Him the most High\nRapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds\nDid, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God\nHigh in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,\nExempt from Death; to shew thee what reward\nAwaits the good, the rest what punishment;\nWhich now direct thine eyes and soon behold.\nHe look'd, & saw the face of things quite chang'd;\nThe brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,\nAll now was turn'd to jollitie and game,\nTo luxurie and riot, feast and dance,\nMarrying or prostituting, as befell,\nRape or Adulterie, where passing faire\nAllurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.\nAt length a Reverend Sire among them came,\nAnd of thir doings great dislike declar'd,\nAnd testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft\nFrequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,\nTriumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd\nConversion and Repentance, as to Souls\nIn prison under Judgements imminent:\nBut all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd\nContending, and remov'd his Tents farr off;\nThen from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,\nBegan to build a Vessel of huge bulk,\nMeasur'd by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth,\nSmeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore\nContriv'd, and of provisions laid in large\nFor Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!\nOf everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small\nCame seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught\nThir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons\nWith thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore.\nMeanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings\nWide hovering, all the Clouds together drove\nFrom under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie\nVapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,\nSent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie\nLike a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain\nImpetuous, and continu'd till the Earth\nNo more was seen; the floating Vessel swum\nUplifted; and secure with beaked prow\nRode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else\nFlood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp\nDeep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea,\nSea without shoar; and in thir Palaces\nWhere luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd\nAnd stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late,\nAll left, in one small bottom swum imbark't.\nHow didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold\nThe end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,\nDepopulation; thee another Floud,\nOf tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd,\nAnd sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard\nBy th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,\nThough comfortless, as when a Father mourns\nHis Childern, all in view destroyd at once;\nAnd scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.\nO Visions ill foreseen! better had I\nLiv'd ignorant of future, so had borne\nMy part of evil onely, each dayes lot\nAnough to bear; those now, that were dispenst\nThe burd'n of many Ages, on me light\nAt once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth\nAbortive, to torment me ere thir being,\nWith thought that they must be. Let no man seek\nHenceforth to be foretold what shall befall\nHim or his Childern, evil he may be sure,\nWhich neither his foreknowing can prevent,\nAnd hee the future evil shall no less\nIn apprehension then in substance feel\nGrievous to bear: but that care now is past,\nMan is not whom to warne: those few escap't\nFamin and anguish will at last consume\nWandring that watrie Desert: I had hope\nWhen violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth,\nAll would have then gon well, peace would have crownd\nWith length of happy days the race of man;\nBut I was farr deceav'd; for now I see\nPeace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste.\nHow comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,\nAnd whether here the Race of man will end.\nTo whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst\nIn triumph and luxurious wealth, are they\nFirst seen in acts of prowess eminent\nAnd great exploits, but of true vertu void;\nWho having spilt much blood, and don much waste\nSubduing Nations, and achievd thereby\nFame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,\nShall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,\nSurfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride\nRaise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.\nThe conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr\nShall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose\nAnd feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd\nIn sharp contest of Battel found no aide\nAgainst invaders; therefore coold in zeale\nThenceforth shall practice how to live secure,\nWorldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords\nShall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear\nMore then anough, that temperance may be tri'd:\nSo all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd,\nJustice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;\nOne Man except, the onely Son of light\nIn a dark Age, against example good,\nAgainst allurement, custom, and a World\nOffended; fearless of reproach and scorn,\nOr violence, hee of thir wicked wayes\nShall them admonish, and before them set\nThe paths of righteousness, how much more safe,\nAnd full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come\nOn thir impenitence; and shall returne\nOf them derided, but of God observd\nThe one just Man alive; by his command\nShall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,\nTo save himself and houshold from amidst\nA World devote to universal rack.\nNo sooner hee with them of Man and Beast\nSelect for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd,\nAnd shelterd round, but all the Cataracts\nOf Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre\nRaine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep\nBroke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp\nBeyond all bounds, till inundation rise\nAbove the highest Hills: then shall this Mount\nOf Paradise by might of Waves be moovd\nOut of his place, pushd by the horned floud,\nWith all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift\nDown the great River to the op'ning Gulf,\nAnd there take root an Iland salt and bare,\nThe haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.\nTo teach thee that God attributes to place\nNo sanctitie, if none be thither brought\nBy Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.\nAnd now what further shall ensue, behold.\nHe lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,\nWhich now abated, for the Clouds were fled,\nDrivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie\nWrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd;\nAnd the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass\nGaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,\nAs after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink\nFrom standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole\nWith soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt\nHis Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut.\nThe Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground\nFast on the top of som high mountain fixt.\nAnd now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;\nWith clamor thence the rapid Currents drive\nTowards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde.\nForthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,\nAnd after him, the surer messenger,\nA Dove sent forth once and agen to spie\nGreen Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;\nThe second time returning, in his Bill\nAn Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:\nAnon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke\nThe ancient Sire descends with all his Train;\nThen with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,\nGrateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds\nA dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow\nConspicuous with three lifted colours gay,\nBetok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new.\nWhereat the heart of Adam erst so sad\nGreatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth.\nO thou that future things canst represent\nAs present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive\nAt this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live\nWith all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve.\nFarr less I now lament for one whole World\nOf wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce\nFor one Man found so perfet and so just,\nThat God voutsafes to raise another World\nFrom him, and all his anger to forget.\nBut say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,\nDistended as the Brow of God appeas'd,\nOr serve they as a flourie verge to binde\nThe fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,\nLeast it again dissolve and showr the Earth?\nTo whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st;\nSo willingly doth God remit his Ire,\nThough late repenting him of Man deprav'd,\nGriev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw\nThe whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh\nCorrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd,\nSuch grace shall one just Man find in his sight,\nThat he relents, not to blot out mankind,\nAnd makes a Covenant never to destroy\nThe Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea\nSurpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World\nWith Man therein or Beast; but when he brings\nOver the Earth a Cloud, will therein set\nHis triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look\nAnd call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night,\nSeed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost\nShall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,\nBoth Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.\nThus thou hast seen one World begin and end;\nAnd Man as from a second stock proceed.\nMuch thou hast yet to see, but I perceave\nThy mortal sight to faile; objects divine\nMust needs impaire and wearie human sense:\nHenceforth what is to com I will relate,\nThou therefore give due audience, and attend.\nThis second sours of Men, while yet but few,\nAnd while the dread of judgement past remains\nFresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie,\nWith some regard to what is just and right\nShall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace,\nLabouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop,\nCorn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock,\nOft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,\nWith large Wine-offerings pour'd, and sacred Feast\nShal spend thir dayes in joy unblam'd, and dwell\nLong time in peace by Families and Tribes\nUnder paternal rule; till one shall rise\nOf proud ambitious heart, who not content\nWith fair equalitie, fraternal state,\nWill arrogate Dominion undeserv'd\nOver his brethren, and quite dispossess\nConcord and law of Nature from the Earth;\nHunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game)\nWith Warr and hostile snare such as refuse\nSubjection to his Empire tyrannous:\nA mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl'd\nBefore the Lord, as in despite of Heav'n,\nOr from Heav'n claming second Sovrantie;\nAnd from Rebellion shall derive his name,\nThough of Rebellion others he accuse.\nHee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns\nWith him or under him to tyrannize,\nMarching from Eden towards the West, shall finde\nThe Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge\nBoiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;\nOf Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build\nA Citie & Towre, whose top may reach to Heav'n;\nAnd get themselves a name, least far disperst\nIn foraign Lands thir memorie be lost,\nRegardless whether good or evil fame.\nBut God who oft descends to visit men\nUnseen, and through thir habitations walks\nTo mark thir doings, them beholding soon,\nComes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower\nObstruct Heav'n Towrs, and in derision sets\nUpon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase\nQuite out thir Native Language, and instead\nTo sow a jangling noise of words unknown:\nForthwith a hideous gabble rises loud\nAmong the Builders; each to other calls\nNot understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,\nAs mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav'n\nAnd looking down, to see the hubbub strange\nAnd hear the din; thus was the building left\nRidiculous, and the work Confusion nam'd.\nWhereto thus Adam fatherly displeas'd.\nO execrable Son so to aspire\nAbove his Brethren, to himself affirming\nAuthoritie usurpt, from God not giv'n:\nHe gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl\nDominion absolute; that right we hold\nBy his donation; but Man over men\nHe made not Lord; such title to himself\nReserving, human left from human free.\nBut this Usurper his encroachment proud\nStayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends\nSiege and defiance: Wretched man! what food\nWill he convey up thither to sustain\nHimself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire\nAbove the Clouds will pine his entrails gross,\nAnd famish him of Breath, if not of Bread?\nTo whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorr'st\nThat Son, who on the quiet state of men\nSuch trouble brought, affecting to subdue\nRational Libertie; yet know withall,\nSince thy original lapse, true Libertie\nIs lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells\nTwinn'd, and from her hath no dividual being:\nReason in man obscur'd, or not obeyd,\nImmediately inordinate desires\nAnd upstart Passions catch the Government\nFrom Reason, and to servitude reduce\nMan till then free. Therefore since hee permits\nWithin himself unworthie Powers to reign\nOver free Reason, God in Judgement just\nSubjects him from without to violent Lords;\nWho oft as undeservedly enthrall\nHis outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,\nThough to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.\nYet somtimes Nations will decline so low\nFrom vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,\nBut Justice, and some fatal curse annext\nDeprives them of thir outward libertie,\nThir inward lost: Witness th' irreverent Son\nOf him who built the Ark, who for the shame\nDon to his Father, heard this heavie curse,\nServant of servants, on his vitious Race.\nThus will this latter, as the former World,\nStill tend from bad to worse, till God at last\nWearied with their iniquities, withdraw\nHis presence from among them, and avert\nHis holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth\nTo leave them to thir own polluted wayes;\nAnd one peculiar Nation to select\nFrom all the rest, of whom to be invok'd,\nA Nation from one faithful man to spring:\nHim on this side Euphrates yet residing,\nBred up in Idol-worship; O that men\n(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,\nWhile yet the Patriark liv'd, who scap'd the Flood,\nAs to forsake the living God, and fall\nTo-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone\nFor Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes\nTo call by Vision from his Fathers house,\nHis kindred and false Gods, into a Land\nWhich he will shew him, and from him will raise\nA mightie Nation, and upon him showre\nHis benediction so, that in his Seed\nAll Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,\nNot knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:\nI see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith\nHe leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile\nUr of Chaldæa, passing now the Ford\nTo Haran, after him a cumbrous Train\nOf Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;\nNot wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth\nWith God, who call'd him, in a land unknown.\nCanaan he now attains, I see his Tents\nPitcht about Sechem, and the neighbouring Plaine\nOf Moreb; there by promise he receaves\nGift to his Progenie of all that Land;\nFrom Hamath Northward to the Desert South\n(Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam'd)\nFrom Hermon East to the great Western Sea,\nMount Hermon, yonder Sea, each place behold\nIn prospect, as I point them; on the shoare\nMount Carmel; here the double-founted stream\nJordan, true limit Eastward; but his Sons\nShall dwell to Senir; that long ridge of Hills.\nThis ponder, that all Nations of the Earth\nShall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed\nIs meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise\nThe Serpents head; whereof to thee anon\nPlainlier shall be reveald. This Patriarch blest,\nWhom faithful Abraham due time shall call,\nA Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,\nLike him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;\nThe Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs\nFrom Canaan, to a Land hereafter call'd\nEgypt, divided by the River Nile;\nSee where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes\nInto the Sea: to sojourn in that Land\nHe comes invited by a yonger Son\nIn time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds\nRaise him to be the second in that Realme\nOf Pharao: there he dies, and leaves his Race\nGrowing into a Nation, and now grown\nSuspected to a sequent King, who seeks\nTo stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests\nToo numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves\nInhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:\nTill by two brethren (those two brethren call\nMoses and Aaron) sent from God to claime\nHis people from enthralment, they return\nWith glory and spoile back to thir promis'd Land.\nBut first the lawless Tyrant, who denies\nTo know thir God, or message to regard,\nMust be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire;\nTo blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,\nFrogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill\nWith loath'd intrusion, and fill all the land;\nHis Cattel must of Rot and Murren die,\nBotches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,\nAnd all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,\nHaile mixt with fire must rend th' Egyptian Skie\nAnd wheel on th' Earth, devouring where it rouls;\nWhat it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,\nA darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down\nMust eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:\nDarkness must overshadow all his bounds,\nPalpable darkness, and blot out three dayes;\nLast with one midnight stroke all the first-born\nOf Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds\nThis River-dragon tam'd at length submits\nTo let his sojourners depart, and oft\nHumbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice\nMore hard'nd after thaw, till in his rage\nPursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea\nSwallows him with his Host, but them lets pass\nAs on drie land between two christal walls,\nAw'd by the rod of Moses so to stand\nDivided, till his rescu'd gain thir shoar:\nSuch wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,\nThough present in his Angel, who shall goe\nBefore them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,\nBy day a Cloud, by night a pillar of Fire,\nTo guide them in thir journey, and remove\nBehinde them, while th' obdurat King pursues:\nAll night he will pursue, but his approach\nDarkness defends between till morning Watch;\nThen through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud\nGod looking forth will trouble all his Host\nAnd craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command\nMoses once more his potent Rod extends\nOver the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;\nOn thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,\nAnd overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect\nSafe towards Canaan from the shoar advance\nThrough the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,\nLeast entring on the Canaanite allarmd\nWarr terrifie them inexpert, and feare\nReturn them back to Egypt, choosing rather\nInglorious life with servitude; for life\nTo noble and ignoble is more sweet\nUntraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on.\nThis also shall they gain by thir delay\nIn the wide Wilderness, there they shall found\nThir government, and thir great Senate choose\nThrough the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:\nGod from the Mount of Sinai, whose gray top\nShall tremble, he descending, will himself\nIn Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound\nOrdaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine\nTo civil Justice, part religious Rites\nOf sacrifice, informing them, by types\nAnd shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise\nThe Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve\nMankinds deliverance. But the voice of God\nTo mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech\nThat Moses might report to them his will,\nAnd terror cease; he grants them thir desire,\nInstructed that to God is no access\nWithout Mediator, whose high Office now\nMoses in figure beares, to introduce\nOne greater, of whose day he shall foretell,\nAnd all the Prophets in thir Age the times\nOf great Messiah shall sing. Thus Laws and Rites\nEstablisht, such delight hath God in Men\nObedient to his will, that he voutsafes\nAmong them to set up his Tabernacle,\nThe holy One with mortal Men to dwell:\nBy his prescript a Sanctuary is fram'd\nOf Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein\nAn Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,\nThe Records of his Cov'nant, over these\nA Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings\nOf two bright Cherubim, before him burn\nSeaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing\nThe Heav'nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud\nShall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night,\nSave when they journie, and at length they come,\nConducted by his Angel to the Land\nPromisd to Abraham and his Seed: the rest\nWere long to tell, how many Battels fought,\nHow many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,\nOr how the Sun shall in mid Heav'n stand still\nA day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,\nMans voice commanding, Sun in Gibeon stand,\nAnd thou Moon in the vale of Aialon\nTill Israel overcome; so call the third\nFrom Abraham, Son of Isaac, and from him\nHis whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.\nHere Adam interpos'd. O sent from Heav'n,\nEnlightner of my darkness, gracious things\nThou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne\nJust Abraham and his Seed: now first I finde\nMine eyes true op'ning, and my heart much eas'd,\nErwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom\nOf mee and all Mankind; but now I see\nHis day, in whom all Nations shall be blest,\nFavour unmerited by me, who sought\nForbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means.\nThis yet I apprehend not, why to those\nAmong whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth\nSo many and so various Laws are giv'n;\nSo many Laws argue so many sins\nAmong them; how can God with such reside?\nTo whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin\nWill reign among them, as of thee begot;\nAnd therefore was Law given them to evince\nThir natural pravitie, by stirring up\nSin against Law to fight; that when they see\nLaw can discover sin, but not remove,\nSave by those shadowie expiations weak,\nThe bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude\nSome bloud more precious must be paid for Man,\nJust for unjust, that in such righteousness\nTo them by Faith imputed, they may finde\nJustification towards God, and peace\nOf Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies\nCannot appease, nor Man the moral part\nPerform, and not performing cannot live.\nSo Law appears imperfet, and but giv'n\nWith purpose to resign them in full time\nUp to a better Cov'nant, disciplin'd\nFrom shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,\nFrom imposition of strict Laws, to free\nAcceptance of large Grace, from servil fear\nTo filial, works of Law to works of Faith.\nAnd therefore shall not Moses, though of God\nHighly belov'd, being but the Minister\nOf Law, his people into Canaan lead;\nBut Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call,\nHis Name and Office bearing, who shall quell\nThe adversarie Serpent, and bring back\nThrough the worlds wilderness long wanderd man\nSafe to eternal Paradise of rest.\nMeanwhile they in thir earthly Canaan plac't\nLong time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins\nNational interrupt thir public peace,\nProvoking God to raise them enemies:\nFrom whom as oft he saves them penitent\nBy Judges first, then under Kings; of whom\nThe second, both for pietie renownd\nAnd puissant deeds, a promise shall receive\nIrrevocable, that his Regal Throne\nFor ever shall endure; the like shall sing\nAll Prophecie, [t]hat of the Royal Stock\nOf David (so I name this King) shall rise\nA Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold,\nForetold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust\nAll Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings\nThe last, for of his Reign shall be no end.\nBut first a long succession must ensue,\nAnd his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam'd,\nThe clouded Ark of God till then in Tents\nWandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.\nSuch follow him, as shall be registerd\nPart good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,\nWhose foul Idolatries, and other faults\nHeapt to the popular summe, will so incense\nGod, as to leave them, and expose thir Land,\nThir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark\nWith all his sacred things, a scorn and prey\nTo that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw'st\nLeft in confusion, Babylon thence call'd.\nThere in captivitie he lets them dwell\nThe space of seventie years, then brings them back,\nRemembring mercie, and his Cov'nant sworn\nTo David, stablisht as the dayes of Heav'n.\nReturnd from Babylon by leave of Kings\nThir Lords, whom God dispos'd, the house of God\nThey first re-edifie, and for a while\nIn mean estate live moderate, till grown\nIn wealth and multitude, factious they grow;\nBut first among the Priests dissension springs,\nMen who attend the Altar, and should most\nEndeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings\nUpon the Temple it self: at last they seise\nThe Scepter, and regard not Davids Sons,\nThen loose it to a stranger, that the true\nAnointed King Messiah might be born\nBarr'd of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr\nUnseen before in Heav'n proclaims him com,\nAnd guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire\nHis place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;\nHis place of birth a solemn Angel tells\nTo simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night;\nThey gladly thither haste, and by a Quire\nOf squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung.\nA Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire\nThe Power of the most High; he shall ascend\nThe Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign\nWith earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav'ns.\nHe ceas'd, discerning Adam with such joy\nSurcharg'd, as had like grief bin dew'd in tears,\nWithout the vent of words, which these he breathd.\nO Prophet of glad tidings, finisher\nOf utmost hope! now clear I understand\nWhat oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,\nWhy our great expectation should be call'd\nThe seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,\nHigh in the love of Heav'n, yet from my Loynes\nThou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son\nOf God most High; So God with man unites.\nNeeds must the Serpent now his capital bruise\nExpect with mortal paine: say where and when\nThir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.\nTo whom thus Michael. Dream not of thir fight,\nAs of a Duel, or the local wounds\nOf head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son\nManhood to God-head, with more strength to foil\nThy enemie; nor so is overcome\nSatan, whose fall from Heav'n, a deadlier bruise,\nDisabl'd not to give thee thy deaths wound:\nWhich hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,\nNot by destroying Satan, but his works\nIn thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be,\nBut by fulfilling that which thou didst want,\nObedience to the Law of God, impos'd\nOn penaltie of death, and suffering death,\nThe penaltie to thy transgression due,\nAnd due to theirs which out of thine will grow:\nSo onely can high Justice rest appaid.\nThe Law of God exact he shall fulfill\nBoth by obedience and by love, though love\nAlone fulfill the Law; thy punishment\nHe shall endure by coming in the Flesh\nTo a reproachful life and cursed death,\nProclaiming Life to all who shall believe\nIn his redemption, and that his obedience\nImputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits\nTo save them, not thir own, though legal works.\nFor this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd,\nSeis'd on by force, judg'd, and to death condemnd\nA shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross\nBy his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life;\nBut to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies,\nThe Law that is against thee, and the sins\nOf all mankinde, with him there crucifi'd,\nNever to hurt them more who rightly trust\nIn this his satisfaction; so he dies,\nBut soon revives, Death over him no power\nShall long usurp; ere the third dawning light\nReturne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise\nOut of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,\nThy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,\nHis death for Man, as many as offerd Life\nNeglect not, and the benefit imbrace\nBy Faith not void of works: this God-like act\nAnnuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy'd,\nIn sin for ever lost from life; this act\nShall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength\nDefeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes,\nAnd fix farr deeper in his head thir stings\nThen temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,\nOr theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,\nA gentle wafting to immortal Life.\nNor after resurrection shall he stay\nLonger on Earth then certaine times to appeer\nTo his Disciples, Men who in his Life\nStill follow'd him; to them shall leave in charge\nTo teach all nations what of him they learn'd\nAnd his Salvation, them who shall beleeve\nBaptizing in the profluent streame, the signe\nOf washing them from guilt of sin to Life\nPure, and in mind prepar'd, if so befall,\nFor death, like that which the redeemer dy'd.\nAll Nations they shall teach; for from that day\nNot onely to the Sons of Abrahams Loines\nSalvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons\nOf Abrahams Faith wherever through the world;\nSo in his seed all Nations shall be blest.\nThen to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend\nWith victory, triumphing through the aire\nOver his foes and thine; there shall surprise\nThe Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines\nThrough all his realme, & there confounded leave;\nThen enter into glory, and resume\nHis Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high\nAbove all names in Heav'n; and thence shall come,\nWhen this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,\nWith glory and power to judge both quick & dead,\nTo judge th' unfaithful dead, but to reward\nHis faithful, and receave them into bliss,\nWhether in Heav'n or Earth, for then the Earth\nShall all be Paradise, far happier place\nThen this of Eden, and far happier daies.\nSo spake th' Archangel Michael, then paus'd,\nAs at the Worlds great period; and our Sire\nReplete with joy and wonder thus repli'd.\nO goodness infinite, goodness immense!\nThat all this good of evil shall produce,\nAnd evil turn to good; more wonderful\nThen that which by creation first brought forth\nLight out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,\nWhether I should repent me now of sin\nBy mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce\nMuch more, that much more good thereof shall spring,\nTo God more glory, more good will to Men\nFrom God, and over wrauth grace shall abound.\nBut say, if our deliverer up to Heav'n\nMust reascend, what will betide the few\nHis faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd,\nThe enemies of truth; who then shall guide\nHis people, who defend? will they not deale\nWors with his followers then with him they dealt?\nBe sure they will, said th' Angel; but from Heav'n\nHee to his own a Comforter will send,\nThe promise of the Father, who shall dwell\nHis Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith\nWorking through love, upon thir hearts shall write,\nTo guide them in all truth, and also arme\nWith spiritual Armour, able to resist\nSatans assaults, and quench his fierie darts\nWhat Man can do against them, not affraid,\nThough to the death, against such cruelties\nWith inward consolations recompenc't,\nAnd oft supported so as shall amaze\nThir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit\nPowrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends\nTo evangelize the Nations, then on all\nBaptiz'd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue\nTo speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,\nAs did thir Lord before them. Thus they win\nGreat numbers of each Nation to receave\nWith joy the tidings brought from Heav'n: at length\nThir Ministry perform'd, and race well run,\nThir doctrine and thir story written left,\nThey die; but in thir room, as they forewarne,\nWolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,\nWho all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n\nTo thir own vile advantages shall turne\nOf lucre and ambition, and the truth\nWith superstitions and traditions taint,\nLeft onely in those written Records pure,\nThough not but by the Spirit understood.\nThen shall they seek to avail themselves of names,\nPlaces and titles, and with these to joine\nSecular power, though feigning still to act\nBy spiritual, to themselves appropriating\nThe Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv'n\nTo all Beleevers; and from that pretense,\nSpiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force\nOn every conscience; Laws which none shall finde\nLeft them inrould, or what the Spirit within\nShall on the heart engrave. What will they then\nBut force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde\nHis consort Libertie; what, but unbuild\nHis living Temples, built by Faith to stand,\nThir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth\nWho against Faith and Conscience can be heard\nInfallible? yet many will presume:\nWhence heavie persecution shall arise\nOn all who in the worship persevere\nOf Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part,\nWill deem in outward Rites and specious formes\nReligion satisfi'd; Truth shall retire\nBestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith\nRarely be found: so shall the World goe on,\nTo good malignant, to bad men benigne,\nUnder her own waight groaning, till the day\nAppeer of respiration to the just,\nAnd vengeance to the wicked, at return\nOf him so lately promis'd to thy aid,\nThe Womans seed, obscurely then foretold,\nNow amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,\nLast in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald\nIn glory of the Father, to dissolve\nSatan with his perverted World, then raise\nFrom the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd,\nNew Heav'ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date\nFounded in righteousness and peace and love,\nTo bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.\nHe ended; and thus Adam last reply'd.\nHow soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,\nMeasur'd this transient World, the Race of time,\nTill time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,\nEternitie, whose end no eye can reach.\nGreatly instructed I shall hence depart,\nGreatly in peace of thought, and have my fill\nOf knowledge, what this vessel can containe;\nBeyond which was my folly to aspire.\nHenceforth I learne, that to obey is best,\nAnd love with feare the onely God, to walk\nAs in his presence, ever to observe\nHis providence, and on him sole depend,\nMerciful over all his works, with good\nStill overcoming evil, and by small\nAccomplishing great things, by things deemd weak\nSubverting worldly strong, and worldly wise\nBy simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake\nIs fortitude to highest victorie,\nAnd to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;\nTaught this by his example whom I now\nAcknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.\nTo whom thus also th' Angel last repli'd:\nThis having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe\nOf wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs\nThou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal Powers,\nAll secrets of the deep, all Natures works,\nOr works of God in Heav'n, Air, Earth, or Sea,\nAnd all the riches of this World enjoydst,\nAnd all the rule, one Empire; onely add\nDeeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,\nAdd Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,\nBy name to come call'd Charitie, the soul\nOf all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath\nTo leave this Paradise, but shalt possess\nA Paradise within thee, happier farr.\nLet us descend now therefore from this top\nOf Speculation; for the hour precise\nExacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,\nBy mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect\nThir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword,\nIn signal of remove, waves fiercely round;\nWe may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;\nHer also I with gentle Dreams have calm'd\nPortending good, and all her spirits compos'd\nTo meek submission: thou at season fit\nLet her with thee partake what thou hast heard,\nChiefly what may concern her Faith to know,\nThe great deliverance by her Seed to come\n(For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind.\nThat ye may live, which will be many dayes,\nBoth in one Faith unanimous though sad,\nWith cause for evils past, yet much more cheer'd\nWith meditation on the happie end.\nHe ended, and they both descend the Hill;\nDescended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve\nLay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't;\nAnd thus with words not sad she him receav'd.\nWhence thou returnst, & whither wentst, I know;\nFor God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,\nWhich he hath sent propitious, some great good\nPresaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress\nVVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;\nIn mee is no delay; with thee to goe,\nIs to stay here; without thee here to stay,\nIs to go hence unwilling; thou to mee\nArt all things under Heav'n, all places thou,\nVVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence.\nThis further consolation yet secure\nI carry hence; though all by mee is lost,\nSuch favour I unworthie am voutsaft,\nBy mee the Promis'd Seed shall all restore.\nSo spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard\nVVell pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh\nTh' Archangel stood, and from the other Hill\nTo thir fixt Station, all in bright array\nThe Cherubim descended; on the ground\nGliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist\nRis'n from a River o're the marish glides,\nAnd gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel\nHomeward returning.

    "Rapt with the rage of mine own ravish'd thought,\nThrough contemplation of those goodly sights,\nAnd glorious images in heaven wrought,\nWhose wondrous beauty, breathing sweet delights\nDo kindle love in high-conceited sprights;\nI fain to tell the things that I behold,\nBut feel my wits to fail, and tongue to fold.\nVouchsafe then, O thou most Almighty Spright,\nFrom whom all gifts of wit and knowledge flow,\nTo shed into my breast some sparkling light\nOf thine eternal truth, that I may show\nSome little beams to mortal eyes below\nOf that immortal beauty, there with thee,\nWhich in my weak distraughted mind I see;\nThat with the glory of so goodly sight\nThe hearts of men, which fondly here admire\nFair seeming shews, and feed on vain delight,\nTransported with celestial desire\nOf those fair forms, may lift themselves up higher,\nAnd learn to love, with zealous humble duty,\nTh' eternal fountain of that heavenly beauty.\nBeginning then below, with th' easy view\nOf this base world, subject to fleshly eye,\nFrom thence to mount aloft, by order due,\nTo contemplation of th' immortal sky;\nOf the soare falcon so I learn to fly,\nThat flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath,\nTill she herself for stronger flight can breathe.\nThen look, who list thy gazeful eyes to feed\nWith sight of that is fair, look on the frame\nOf this wide universe, and therein reed\nThe endless kinds of creatures which by name\nThou canst not count, much less their natures aim;\nAll which are made with wondrous wise respect,\nAnd all with admirable beauty deckt.\nFirst th' earth, on adamantine pillars founded,\nAmid the sea engirt with brazen bands;\nThen th' air still flitting, but yet firmly bounded\nOn every side, with piles of flaming brands,\nNever consum'd, nor quench'd with mortal hands;\nAnd last, that mighty shining crystal wall,\nWherewith he hath encompassed this All.\nBy view whereof it plainly may appear,\nThat still as every thing doth upward tend,\nAnd further is from earth, so still more clear\nAnd fair it grows, till to his perfect end\nOf purest beauty it at last ascend;\nAir more than water, fire much more than air,\nAnd heaven than fire, appears more pure and fair.\nLook thou no further, but affix thine eye\nOn that bright, shiny, round, still moving mass,\nThe house of blessed gods, which men call sky,\nAll sow'd with glist'ring stars more thick than grass,\nWhereof each other doth in brightness pass,\nBut those two most, which ruling night and day,\nAs king and queen, the heavens' empire sway;\nAnd tell me then, what hast thou ever seen\nThat to their beauty may compared be,\nOr can the sight that is most sharp and keen\nEndure their captain's flaming head to see?\nHow much less those, much higher in degree,\nAnd so much fairer, and much more than these,\nAs these are fairer than the land and seas?\nFor far above these heavens, which here we see,\nBe others far exceeding these in light,\nNot bounded, not corrupt, as these same be,\nBut infinite in largeness and in height,\nUnmoving, uncorrupt, and spotless bright,\nThat need no sun t' illuminate their spheres,\nBut their own native light far passing theirs.\nAnd as these heavens still by degrees arise,\nUntil they come to their first Mover's bound,\nThat in his mighty compass doth comprise,\nAnd carry all the rest with him around;\nSo those likewise do by degrees redound,\nAnd rise more fair; till they at last arrive\nTo the most fair, whereto they all do strive.\nFair is the heaven where happy souls have place,\nIn full enjoyment of felicity,\nWhence they do still behold the glorious face\nOf the divine eternal Majesty;\nMore fair is that, where those Ideas on high\nEnranged be, which Plato so admired,\nAnd pure Intelligences from God inspired.\nYet fairer is that heaven, in which do reign\nThe sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates,\nWhich in their high protections do contain\nAll mortal princes and imperial states;\nAnd fairer yet, whereas the royal Seats\nAnd heavenly Dominations are set,\nFrom whom all earthly governance is fet.\nYet far more fair be those bright Cherubins,\nWhich all with golden wings are overdight,\nAnd those eternal burning Seraphins,\nWhich from their faces dart out fiery light;\nYet fairer than they both, and much more bright,\nBe th' Angels and Archangels, which attend\nOn God's own person, without rest or end.\nThese thus in fair each other far excelling,\nAs to the highest they approach more near,\nYet is that highest far beyond all telling,\nFairer than all the rest which there appear,\nThough all their beauties join'd together were;\nHow then can mortal tongue hope to express\nThe image of such endless perfectness?\nCease then, my tongue, and lend unto my mind\nLeave to bethink how great that beauty is,\nWhose utmost parts so beautiful I find;\nHow much more those essential parts of his,\nHis truth, his love, his wisdom, and his bliss,\nHis grace, his doom, his mercy, and his might,\nBy which he lends us of himself a sight.\nThose unto all he daily doth display,\nAnd shew himself in th' image of his grace,\nAs in a looking-glass, through which he may\nBe seen of all his creatures vile and base,\nThat are unable else to see his face,\nHis glorious face which glistereth else so bright,\nThat th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight.\nBut we, frail wights, whose sight cannot sustain\nThe sun's bright beams when he on us doth shine,\nBut that their points rebutted back again\nAre dull'd, how can we see with feeble eyne\nThe glory of that Majesty Divine,\nIn sight of whom both sun and moon are dark,\nCompared to his least resplendent spark?\nThe means, therefore, which unto us is lent\nHim to behold, is on his works to look,\nWhich he hath made in beauty excellent,\nAnd in the same, as in a brazen book,\nTo read enregister'd in every nook\nHis goodness, which his beauty doth declare;\nFor all that's good is beautiful and fair.\nThence gathering plumes of perfect speculation,\nTo imp the wings of thy high-flying mind,\nMount up aloft through heavenly contemplation,\nFrom this dark world, whose damps the soul so blind,\nAnd, like the native brood of eagles' kind,\nOn that bright Sun of Glory fix thine eyes,\nClear'd from gross mists of frail infirmities.\nHumbled with fear and awful reverence,\nBefore the footstool of his majesty\nThrow thyself down, with trembling innocence,\nNe dare look up with corruptible eye\nOn the dread face of that great Deity,\nFor fear, lest if he chance to look on thee,\nThou turn to nought, and quite confounded be.\nBut lowly fall before his mercy seat,\nClose covered with the Lamb's integrity\nFrom the just wrath of his avengeful threat\nThat sits upon the righteous throne on high;\nHis throne is built upon eternity,\nMore firm and durable than steel or brass,\nOr the hard diamond, which them both doth pass.\nHis sceptre is the rod of righteousness,\nWith which he bruiseth all his foes to dust,\nAnd the great Dragon strongly doth repress,\nUnder the rigour of his judgement just;\nHis seat is truth, to which the faithful trust,\nFrom whence proceed her beams so pure and bright\nThat all about him sheddeth glorious light:\nLight far exceeding that bright blazing spark\nWhich darted is from Titan's flaming head,\nThat with his beams enlumineth the dark\nAnd dampish air, whereby all things are read;\nWhose nature yet so much is marvelled\nOf mortal wits, that it doth much amaze\nThe greatest wizards which thereon do gaze.\nBut that immortal light, which there doth shine,\nIs many thousand times more bright, more clear,\nMore excellent, more glorious, more divine,\nThrough which to God all mortal actions here,\nAnd even the thoughts of men, do plain appear;\nFor from th' eternal truth it doth proceed,\nThrough heavenly virtue which her beams do breed.\nWith the great glory of that wondrous light\nHis throne is all encompassed around,\nAnd hid in his own brightness from the sight\nOf all that look thereon with eyes unsound;\nAnd underneath his feet are to be found\nThunder and lightning and tempestuous fire,\nThe instruments of his avenging ire.\nThere in his bosom Sapience doth sit,\nThe sovereign darling of the Deity,\nClad like a queen in royal robes, most fit\nFor so great power and peerless majesty,\nAnd all with gems and jewels gorgeously\nAdorn'd, that brighter than the stars appear,\nAnd make her native brightness seem more clear.\nAnd on her head a crown of purest gold\nIs set, in sign of highest sovereignty;\nAnd in her hand a sceptre she doth hold,\nWith which she rules the house of God on high,\nAnd manageth the ever-moving sky,\nAnd in the same these lower creatures all\nSubjected to her power imperial.\nBoth heaven and earth obey unto her will,\nAnd all the creatures which they both contain;\nFor of her fullness which the world doth fill\nThey all partake, and do in state remain\nAs their great Maker did at first ordain,\nThrough observation of her high behest,\nBy which they first were made, and still increast.\nThe fairness of her face no tongue can tell;\nFor she the daughters of all women's race,\nAnd angels eke, in beauty doth excel,\nSparkled on her from God's own glorious face,\nAnd more increas'd by her own goodly grace,\nThat it doth far exceed all human thought,\nNe can on earth compared be to aught.\nNe could that painter (had he lived yet)\nWhich pictured Venus with so curious quill,\nThat all posterity admired it,\nHave portray'd this, for all his mast'ring skill;\nNe she herself, had she remained still,\nAnd were as fair as fabling wits do feign,\nCould once come near this beauty sovereign.\nBut had those wits, the wonders of their days,\nOr that sweet Teian poet, which did spend\nHis plenteous vein in setting forth her praise,\nSeen but a glimpse of this which I pretend,\nHow wondrously would he her face commend,\nAbove that idol of his feigning thought,\nThat all the world should with his rhymes be fraught.\nHow then dare I, the novice of his art,\nPresume to picture so divine a wight,\nOr hope t' express her least perfection's part,\nWhose beauty fills the heavens with her light,\nAnd darks the earth with shadow of her sight?\nAh, gentle Muse, thou art too weak and faint\nThe portrait of so heavenly hue to paint.\nLet angels, which her goodly face behold\nAnd see at will, her sovereign praises sing,\nAnd those most sacred mysteries unfold\nOf that fair love of mighty heaven's King;\nEnough is me t' admire so heavenly thing,\nAnd being thus with her huge love possest,\nIn th' only wonder of herself to rest.\nBut whoso may, thrice happy man him hold,\nOf all on earth whom God so much doth grace\nAnd lets his own beloved to behold;\nFor in the view of her celestial face\nAll joy, all bliss, all happiness, have place;\nNe aught on earth can want unto the wight\nWho of herself can win the wishful sight.\nFor she, out of her secret treasury,\nPlenty of riches forth on him will pour,\nEven heavenly riches, which there hidden lie\nWithin the closet of her chastest bower,\nTh' eternal portion of her precious dower,\nWhich mighty God hath given to her free,\nAnd to all those which thereof worthy be.\nNone thereof worthy be, but those whom she\nVouchsafeth to her presence to receive,\nAnd letteth them her lovely face to see,\nWhereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive,\nAnd sweet contentment, that it doth bereave\nTheir soul of sense, through infinite delight,\nAnd them transport from flesh into the spright.\nIn which they see such admirable things,\nAs carries them into an ecstasy,\nAnd hear such heavenly notes, and carollings\nOf God's high praise, that fills the brazen sky;\nAnd feel such joy and pleasure inwardly,\nThat maketh them all worldly cares forget,\nAnd only think on that before them set.\nNe from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense,\nOr idle thought of earthly things, remain;\nBut all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence,\nAnd all that pleased erst now seems to pain;\nTheir joy, their comfort, their desire, their gain,\nIs fixed all on that which now they see;\nAll other sights but feigned shadows be.\nAnd that fair lamp, which useth to inflame\nThe hearts of men with self-consuming fire\nThenceforth seems foul, and full of sinful blame;\nAnd all that pomp to which proud minds aspire\nBy name of honour, and so much desire,\nSeems to them baseness, and all riches dross,\nAnd all mirth sadness, and all lucre loss.\nSo full their eyes are of that glorious sight,\nAnd senses fraught with such satiety,\nThat in nought else on earth they can delight,\nBut in th' aspect of that felicity,\nWhich they have written in their inward eye;\nOn which they feed, and in their fastened mind\nAll happy joy and full contentment find.\nAh, then, my hungry soul, which long hast fed\nOn idle fancies of thy foolish thought,\nAnd, with false beauty's flatt'ring bait misled,\nHast after vain deceitful shadows sought,\nWhich all are fled, and now have left thee nought\nBut late repentance through thy follies prief;\nAh cease to gaze on matter of thy grief:\nAnd look at last up to that sovereign light,\nFrom whose pure beams all perfect beauty springs,\nThat kindleth love in every godly sprite,\nEven the love of God, which loathing brings\nOf this vile world and these gay-seeming things;\nWith whose sweet pleasures being so possest,\nThy straying thoughts henceforth for ever rest.",

speed\nThe Surgeon affrighted said,\nThe Parson and the Undertaker,\nLet them hasten or I shall be dead.\nThe Parson and the Undertaker\nThey hastily came complying,\nAnd the Surgeon's Prentices ran up stairs\nWhen they heard that their master was dying.\nThe Prentices all they entered the room\nBy one, by two, by three,\nWith a sly grin came Joseph in,\nFirst of the company.\nThe Surgeon swore

eyes,\nAnd faintly struggled to speak.\nAll kinds of carcasses I have cut up,\nAnd the judgment now must be--\nBut brothers I took care of you,\nSo pray take care of me!\nI have made candles of infants fat\nThe Sextons have been my slaves,\nI have bottled babes unborn, and dried\nHearts and livers from rifled graves.\nAnd my Prentices now will surely come\nAnd carve me bone from bone,\nAnd I who have rifled the dead man's grave\nShall never have rest in my own.\nBury me in lead when I am dead,\nMy brethren I intreat,\nAnd see the coffin weigh'd I beg\nLest the Plumber should be a cheat.\nAnd let it be solder'd closely down\nStrong as strong can be I implore,\nAnd put it in a patent coffin,\nThat I may rise no more.\nIf they carry me off in the patent coffin\nTheir labour will be in vain,\nLet the Undertaker see it bought of the maker\nWho lives by St. Martin's lane.\nAnd bury me in my brother's church\nFor that will safer be,\nAnd I implore lock the church door\nAnd pray take care of the key.\nAnd all night long let three stout men\nThe vestry watch within,\nTo each man give a gallon of beer\nAnd a keg of Holland's gin;\nPowder and ball and blunder-buss\nTo save me if he can,\nAnd eke five guineas if he shoot\nA resurrection man.\nAnd let them watch me for three weeks\nMy wretched corpse to save,\nFor then I think that I may stink\nEnough to rest in my grave.\nThe Surgeon laid him down in his bed,\nHis eyes grew deadly dim,\nShort came his breath and the struggle of death\nDistorted every limb.\nThey put him in lead when he was dead\nAnd shrouded up so neat,\nAnd they the leaden coffin weigh\nLest the Plumber should be a cheat.\nThey had it solder'd closely down\nAnd examined it o'er and o'er,\nAnd they put it in a patent coffin\nThat he might rise

shoot they swear\nA resurrection man.\nAnd the first night by lanthorn light\nThro' the church-yard as they went,\nA guinea of gold the sexton shewed\nThat Mister Joseph sent.\nBut conscience was tough, it was not enough\nAnd their honesty never swerved,\nAnd they bade him go with Mister Joe\nTo the Devil as he deserved.\nSo all night long by the vestry fire\nThey quaff'd their gin and ale,\nAnd they did drink as you may think\nAnd told full many a tale.\nThe second night by lanthorn light\nThro' the church-yard as they went,\nHe whisper'd anew and shew'd them two\nThat Mister Joseph sent.\nThe guineas were bright and attracted their sight\nThey look'd so heavy and new,\nAnd their fingers itch'd as they were bewitch'd\nAnd they knew not what to do.\nBut they waver'd not long for conscience was strong\nAnd they thought they might get more,\nAnd they refused the gold, but not\nSo rudely as before.\nSo all night long by the vestry fire\nThey quaff'd their gin and ale,\nAnd they did drink as you may think\nAnd told full many a tale.\nThe third night as by lanthorn light\nThro' the church-yard they went,\nHe bade them see and shew'd them three\nThat Mister Joseph sent.\nThey look'd askance with eager glance,\nThe guineas they shone bright,\nFor the Sexton on the yellow gold\nLet fall his lanthorn light.\nAnd he look'd sly with his roguish eye\nAnd gave a well-tim'd wink,\nAnd they could not stand the sound in his hand\nFor he made the guineas chink.\nAnd conscience late that had such weight,\nAll in a moment fails,\nFor well they knew that it was true\nA dead man told no tales,\nAnd they gave all their powder and ball\nAnd took the gold so bright,\nAnd they drank their beer and made good cheer,\nTill now it was midnight.\nThen, tho' the key of the church door\nWas left with the Parson his brother,\nIt opened at the Sexton's touch--\nBecause he had another.\nAnd in they go with that villain Joe\nTo fetch the body by night,\nAnd all the church look'd dismally\nBy his dark lanthorn light.\nThey laid the pick-axe to the stones\nAnd they moved them soon asunder.\nThey shovell'd away the hard-prest clay\nAnd came to the coffin under.\nThey burst the patent coffin first\nAnd they cut thro' the lead,\nAnd they laugh'd aloud when they saw the shroud\nBecause they had got at the dead.\nAnd they allowed the Sexton the shroud\nAnd they put the coffin back,\nAnd nose and knees they then did squeeze\nThe Surgeon in a sack.\nThe watchmen as they past along\nFull four yards off could smell,\nAnd a curse bestowed upon the load\nSo disagreeable.\nSo they carried the sack a-pick-a-back\nAnd they carv'd him bone from bone,\nBut what became of the Surgeon's soul\nWas never to mortal known.",

eye\nWithin the holy place,\nAnd greatly raise our melody,\nAnd flow our hearts with grace.\nThe largest thought that can arise\nWithin the widest heart\nShall then be filled with surprize,\nAnd pleas'd in every part.\nAll mysteries shall here be seen,\nAnd every knot, unty'd;\nElecting love, that hid hath been,\nShall shine on every side.\nThe God of glory here will be\nThe life of every one;\nWhose goodly attributes shall we\nPossess them as our own.\nBy wisdom we all things shall know,\nBy light all things shall see,\nBy strength, too, all things we shall do,\nWhen we in glory be.\nThe Holy Lamb of God, also,\nWho for our sakes did die,\nThe holy ones of God shall know,\nAnd that most perfectly.\nThose small and short discoveries\nThat we have of him here,\nWill there be seen with open eyes,\nIn visions full and clear.\nThose many thousand acts of grace\nThat here we feel and find,\nShall there be real with open face\nUpon his heart most kind.\nThere he will show us how he was\nOur prophet, priest, and king;\nAnd how he did maintain our cause,\nAnd us to glory bring.\nThere we shall see how he was touch'd\nWith all our grief and pain\n(As in his word he hath avouch'd),\nWhen we with him shall reign;\nHe'll show us, also, how he did\nMaintain our faith and love,\nAnd why his face sometimes he hid\nFrom us, who are his dove;\nThese tempting times that here we have,\nWe there shall see were good;\nAlso that hidden strength he gave,\nThe purchase of his blood.\nThat he should stand for us before\nHis Father, thus we read.\nBut then shall see, and shall adore\nHim for his gracious deed.\nThough we are vile, he without shame\nBefore the angels all\nLays out his strength, his worth, and name,\nFor us, who are in thrall.\nThis is he who was mock'd and beat,\nSpit on, and crown'd with thorns;\nWho for us had a bloody sweat,\nWhose heart was broke with scorns.\n'Tis he who stands so much our friend,\nAs shortly we shall see,\nWith open face, world without end,\nAnd in his presence be.\nThat head that once was crown'd with thorns,\nShall now with glory shine;\nThat heart that broken was with scorns,\nShall flow with life divine;\nThat man that here met with disgrace,\nWe there shall see so bright;\nThat angels can't behold his face\nFor its exceeding light.\nWhat gladness will possess our heart\nWhen we shall see these things!\nWhat light and life, in every part,\nWill rise like lasting springs!\nO blessed face and holy grace,\nWhen shall we see this day?\nLord, fetch us to this goodly place\nWe humbly do thee pray.\nNext to this Lamb we shall behold\nAll saints, both more and less,\nWith whit'ned robes in glory roll'd,\n'Cause him they did confess.\nEach walking in his righteousness\nWith shining crowns of gold,\nTriumphing still in heav'nly bliss,\nAmazing to behold.\nEach person for his majesty\nDoth represent a king;\nYea, angel-like for dignity,\nAnd seraphims that sing.\nEach motion of their mind, and so\nEach twinkling of their eye;\nEach word they speak, and step they go,\nIt is in purity.\nImmortal are they every one,\nWrapt up in health and light,\nMortality from them is gone,\nWeakness is turn'd to might.\nThe stars are not so clear as they,\nThey equalize the sun;\nTheir glory shines to perfect day,\nWhich day will ne'er be done.\nNo sorrow can them now annoy,\nNor weakness, grief or pain;\nNo faintness can abate their joy,\nThey now in life do reign.\nThey shall not there, as here, be vex'd\nWith Satan, men, or sin;\nNor with their wicked hearts perplex'd,\nThe heavens have cop'd[8] them in.\nThus, as they shine in their estate,\nSo, too, in their degree;\nWhich is most goodly to relate,\nAnd ravishing to see.\nThe majesty whom they adore,\nDoth them in wisdom place\nUpon the thrones, and that before\nThe angels, to their grace.\nThe saints of the Old Testament,\nFull right to their degree;\nLikewise the New, in excellent\nMagnificency be.\nEach one his badge of glory wears,\nAccording to his place;\nAccording as was his affairs\nHere, in the time of grace.\nSome on the right hand of the Lamb,\nLikewise some on the left,\nWith robes and golden chains do stand\nMost grave, most sage, and deft.[9]\nThe martyr here is known from him\nWho peaceably did die,\nBoth by the place he sitteth in,\nAnd by his dignity.\nEach father, saint, and prophet shall,\nAccording to his worth,\nEnjoy the honour of his call,\nAnd plainly hold it forth.\nThose bodies which sometimes were torn,\nAnd bones that broken were\nFor God's word; he doth now adorn\nWith health and glory fair.\nThus, when in heav'nly harmony\nThese blessed saints appear,\nAdorn'd with grace and majesty,\nWhat gladness will be there!\nThe light, and grace, and countenance,\nThe least of these shall have,\nWill so with terror them advance,\nAnd make their face so grave,\nThat at them all the world will shake,\nWhen they lift up their head;\nPrinces and kings will at them quake,\nAnd fall before them dead.\nThis shall we see, thus shall we be,\nO would the day were come,\nLord Jesus take us up to thee,\nTo this desired home.\nAngels also we shall behold,\nWhen we on high ascend,\nEach shining like to men of gold,\nAnd on the Lord attend.\nThese goodly creatures, full of grace,\nShall stand about the throne,\nEach one with lightning in his face,\nAnd shall to us be known.\nThese cherubims with one accord\nShall cry continually,\nAh, holy, holy, holy, Lord,\nAnd heavenly majesty.\nThese will us in their arms embrace,\nAnd welcome us to rest,\nAnd joy to see us clad with grace,\nAnd of the heavens possess'd.\nThis we shall hear, this we shall see,\nWhile raptures take us up,\nWhen we with blessed Jesus be,\nAnd at his table sup.\nOh shining angels! what, must we\nWith you lift up our voice?\nWe must; and with you ever be,\nAnd with you must rejoice.\nOur friends that lived godly here,\nShall there be found again;\nThe wife, the child, and father dear,\nWith others of our train.\nEach one down to the foot in white,\nFill'd to the brim with grace,\nWalking among the saints in light,\nWith glad and joyful face.\nThose God did use us to convert,\nWe there with joy shall meet,\nAnd jointly shall, with all our heart,\nIn life each other greet.\nA crown to them we then shall be,\nA glory and a joy;\nAnd that before the Lord, when he\nThe world comes to destroy.\nThis is the place, this is the state,\nOf all that fear the Lord;\nWhich men nor angels may relate\nWith tongue, or pen, or word.\nNo night is here, for to eclipse\nIts spangling rays so bright;\nNor doubt, nor fear to shut the lips,\nOf those within this light.\nThe strings of music here are tun'd\nFor heavenly harmony,\nAnd every spirit here perfum'd\nWith perfect sanctity.\nHere runs the crystal streams of life,\nQuite through all our veins.\nAnd here by love we do unite\nWith glory's golden chains.\nNow that which sweet'neth all will be\nThe lasting of this state;\nThis heightens all we hear or see\nTo a transcendant rate.\nFor should the saints enjoy all this\nBut for a certain time,\nO, how would they their mark then miss,\nAnd at this thing repine?\nYea, 'tis not possible that they\nWho then shall dwell on high,\nShould be content, unless they may\nDwell there eternally.\nA thought of parting with this place\nWould bitter all their sweet,\nAnd darkness put upon the face\nOf all they there do meet.\nBut far from this the saints shall be,\nTheir portion is the Lord,\nWhose face for ever they shall see,\nAs saith the holy word.\nAnd that with everlasting peace,\nJoy, and felicity,\nFrom this time forth they shall increase\nUnto eternity.",
    "The Barrister's Dream\nThey sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;\nThey pursued it with forks and hope;\nThey threatened its life with a railway-share;\nThey charmed it with smiles and soap.\nBut the Barrister, weary of proving in vain\nThat the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,\nFell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain\nThat his fancy had dwelt on so long.\nHe dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,\nWhere the Snark, with a glass in its eye,\nDressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig\nOn the charge of deserting its sty.\nThe Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,\nThat the sty was deserted when found:\nAnd the Judge kept explaining the state of the law\nIn a soft under-current of sound.\nThe indictment had never been clearly expressed,\nAnd it seemed that the Snark had begun,\nAnd had spoken three hours, before any one guessed\nWhat the pig was supposed to have done.\nThe Jury had each formed a different view\n(Long before the indictment was read),\nAnd they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew\nOne word that the others had said.\n\"You must know--\" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed \"Fudge!\"\nThat statute is obsolete quite!\nLet me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends\nOn an ancient manorial right.\n\"In the matter of Treason the pig would appear\nTo have aided, but scarcely abetted:\nWhile the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,\nIf you grant the plea 'never indebted'.\n\"The fact of Desertion I will not dispute:\nBut its guilt, as I trust, is removed\n(So far as relates to the costs of this suit)\nBy the Alibi which has been proved.\n\"My poor client's fate now depends on your votes.\"\nHere the speaker sat down in his place,\nAnd directed the Judge to refer to his notes\nAnd briefly to sum up the case.\nBut the Judge said he never had summed up before;\nSo the Snark undertook it instead,\nAnd summed it so well that it came to far more\nThan the Witnesses ever had said!\nWhen the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,\nAs the word was so puzzling to spell;\nBut they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind\nUndertaking that duty as well.\nSo the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,\nIt was spent with the toils of the day:\nWhen it said the word \"GUILTY!\" the Jury all groaned\nAnd some of them fainted away.\nThen the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite\nToo nervous to utter a word:\nWhen it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,\nAnd the fall of a pin might be heard.\n\"Transportation for life\" was the sentence it gave,\n\"And then to be fined forty pound.\"\nThe Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared\nThat the phrase was not legally sound.\nBut their wild exultation was suddenly checked\nWhen the jailer informed them, with tears,\nSuch a sentence would not have the slightest effect,\nAs the pig had been dead for some years.\nThe Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted\nBut the Snark, though a little aghast,\nAs the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted,\nWent bellowing on to the last.\nThus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed\nTo grow every moment more clear:\nTill he woke to the knell of a furious bell,\nWhich the Bellman rang close at his ear.",

    "This red hush toppling over the sky,\nWanders one step toward the stars\nAnd dies in a questioning shiver.\nThe steel-mill chimneys fling their gaunt seeking\nA little distance into the red\nThat softly combs their smoky hair.\nThe steel-mill chimneys only live at night\nWhen crimson light makes love to them\nAnd star-light trickles through the red,\nLike glimpses of some far-off fairy tale.\nThroughout the day the steel-mill chimneys stand\nRigidly within the wind-whirled glare:\nOnly night can bring them supple straightness.\nII\nFrom the little, brown gate that does not see them\nBecause its eyes are blind with wooing soot,\nAn endless stream of men scatters out\nInto the cool bewilderment of morning.\nUpon their lips a limply child-like surrender\nCurves out to the light, as though they felt\nThe presence of an unassuming strangeness.\nThe morning hides from their eyes:\nThey walk on, in great strides,\nLike blind men swinging over a well-known scene.\nTheir faces twitch with echoes of iron fists:\nTheir faces hold a swarthy stupor\nLoosened by little fingers of morning light\nUntil it droops into reluctant life.\nAnd then their eyes, made flat by night,\nSwell into a Madonna-like surprise\nAt children trooping back in huge disguise.\nthe oranges in lunch-room windows change\nTo sleek suns dipped in sleepy light,\nAnd rounded tarts in china plates\nAre like red heart-beats, resting but not dead.\nA trolley-car speeds by\nAnd seems a strident lyric of motion.\nWagons rumble down the street\nLike drums enticing weariness to step. . . .\nThe hearts of these steel-striding men\nAscend and blend within their eyes,\nAnd yet, these men are unaware of this.\nThey only feel a fluid relief\nVoicing, in a clustered roar,\nThe cries of struggling thoughts unshaped by words.\nBut there are some who break forth from the rest.\nThis old Hungarian strides along\nAnd binds naïvely-winged prayer-sandals\nUpon the heavy feet of shuffling loves.\nGently, he plays with his beard\nAs though his fingers touched a woman's hair.\nAnd this young Slav whose surly blasphemy\nCurls his face into a simple hate,\nHas taken iron into his laugh\nAnd uses it to hew his stony mind.\nWhile this Italian whose deep olive skin\nShines like sunlight groping through dense leaves,\nForgets his battered happiness\nAnd bows with mock grace to his shouting day.\nBeside him is a fellow-countryman\nWalking aimless, dazed with joy of motion.\nUpon his face a glistening vacancy\nLights the mildly querying thoughts\nThat seek each other but never meet.\nBehind him steps a stalwart Pole\nWhose rhythmic, stately insolence\nTurns the sidewalk into a grey carpet,\nGrey as the shades that race across his face\nAnd show the savage squalor of his soul.\nNight has broken her heart upon him,\nOnly scarring his bitter smile.\nA street of little, jack-o'-lantern houses\nVeering into leering saloons,\nWhere the night, a crazy child,\nDips herself in sallow rouge\nAnd chases oaths and heavy mirth\nAnd even human beings:\nWhere the smoky sadness of the steel-mills\nWanders hesitantly into death\nAnd drops a ghostly blur upon this girl.\nHer numbly waxen, cherub face\nEmerges gently from the doorway's blackness\nAs though the dark had given birth to it.\nAnd then the falling light reveals\nThat something of a village hangs about her:\nSomething slumbering and ample.\nThe doorway is too small to hold\nHer shoulders that are like a hill's broad curves\nDwindled in the distance. . . .\nShe is one of many earth-curved girls\nWho listened to the insistent tinkle\nOf wind-winged music from a far-off land:\nListened and knew not\nThat their own hearts faintly played.\nSo she ran to this far phantom,\nOnly finding it within herself\nWhen the city's sly fists rained upon it.\nThen once more she fled\nWith a dead heart whose restless pallor\nCrept to squalid wantonness, for refuge.\nAnd now she stands within this doorway,\nUttering muffled innuendos\nTo the drained men of her race.\nYet, something of a village hangs about her:\nSomething slumbering and ample\nStealing from the earth curves of her shoulders.\nIII\nThe steel-mill workers straggle down this street,\nClanging shut the doorways of their souls,\nAnd the sound rips their lips open.\nThe steel-mill workers do not know of this:\nThey only seek something that will sweeten\nThe dirt that has eaten into their flesh\nAnd change it to raw music.\nThey straggle down this street,\nTheir faces slack and oiled with amorousness.\nLike cats they play with their desires,\nBiting them with little laughs\nUntil the sallow houses draw them in.\nAnd then the night pursues their revelry:\nEchoes from the shut doors of their souls.\nIV\nThree bent women and a child\nStoop before the steel-mill gate\nAs though the morning's ghastly murmur\nWashed against them in a wave\nStiffening them into resisting curves.\nOne is old and floridly misshapen.\nYears have melted out within her frame,\nFlooding her with lukewarm loves.\nThe wrinkles on her flabby face\nAre like a faded scrawl of pain\nScattered by the flesh on which it rests.\nHer frayed shawl hanging unaware of her\nIs a symbol of her heart.\nThe woman standing at her side\nIs tall and like a slanting scarecrow\nColdly jerking in the morning's glare.\nOnly when she lifts a bony hand\nTapping life against her face,\nDoes the image disappear.\nDead dreams dangle in her heart,\nLimply hanging from their rainbow sashes,\nAnd whenever one sash trembles,\nThen, she lifts a gnarled hand to her face\nAnd tastes a moment of departing life.\nNear her stands a slimly rigid woman\nWith an iron fear upon her bones.\nA worn straight-jacket of lines\nCuts the dying youth upon her face.\nThe slender child beside her,\nBuried within staidly murky clothes,\nGlances frightenedly up at her mother:\nGlances as one who dances to a gate\nAnd fumbles for a latch that hides itself.\nThen from the rusty-reveried steel-mill gate\nAn endless stream of men scatter out\nInto the cool bewilderment of morning.\nUpon their lips a limply child-like surrender\nCurves out to the

    "Here, as in childhood, Brother, no one knows us.\nAnd someone has died, and someone is not yet\nborn, while our father walks through his church at night\nand sets all the clocks for spring.  His sleeplessness\nweighs heavy on my forehead, his death almost\nnothing. in the only letter he wrote to us\nhe says, No one can tell how long it takes a seed\nto declare what death and lightning told it\nwhile it slept.  But stand at a window long enough,\nlate enough, and you may some night hear\na secret you'll tomorrow, parallel to the morning,\ntell on a wide, white bed, to a woman\nlike a sown ledge of wheat.  Or you may never\ntell it, who lean across the night and miles of the sea,\nto arrive at a seed, in whose lamplit house\nresides a thorn, or a wee man, carving\na name on a stone, at afluctuating table of water,\nthe name of the one who has died, the name of the one\nnot born unknown.  Someone has died.  Someone\nis not yet born.  And during this black interval,\nI sweep all three floors of our father's house,\nand I don't count the broom strokes; I row\nup and down for nothing but love: his for me, and my own\nfor the threshold, as well as for the woman's name\nI hear while I sweep, as though she swept\nbeside me, a woman who, if she owns a face at all,\nit is its own changing; and if I know her name\nI know to say it so softly she need not\nstop her work to hear me.  But when she lies down\nat night, in the room of our arrival, she'll know\nI called her, though she won't answer, who is on her way\nto sleep, until morning, which even now,\nis overwhelming, the woman combing her hair opposite\nthe direction of my departure.\nAnd only now and then do I lean at a jamb\nto see'if I can see what I thought I heard.\nI heard her ask, My love, why can't you sleep?\nand answer, Someone has died, and someone\nis not yet born.  Meanwhile, I hear the voices\nof women telling a story in the round,\nso I sit down on a rain-eaten stoop, by the saltgrasses,\nand go on folding the laundry I was folding,\nthe everyday clothes of our everyday life, the death\nclothes wearing us clean to the bone, to the very\nilium crest, where my right hand, this hand, half\ncrab, part bird, has often come to rest on her,\nwhose name I know.  And because I sat down,\nI hear their folding sound, and know\nthe tide is rising early, and I can't hope\nto trap their story told in the round.  But the woman\nwhose name I know says, Sleep, so I lie down\non the clothes, the folded and unfolded, the life\nand the death.  Ages go by When I wake, the story\nhas changed the firmament into domain, domain\ninto a house.  And the sun speaks the day,\nunnaming, showing the story, dissipating the boundaries\nof the telling, to include the one who has died\nand the one not yet born.  Someone has died\nand someone is not yet born.  How still\nthis morning grows about the voice of one\nchild reading to another, how much a house\nis house at all due to one room where an elder\nchild reads to his brother, and that younger\nknows by heart the brother-voice.  How darker\nother rooms stand, how slow morning comes, collected\nin a name, told at one sill and listened for\nat the threshold of dew What book is this we read\ntogether, Brother, and at which window\nof our father's house?  In which upper room?\nWe read it twice: Once in two voices, to each\nother; once in unison, to children,\nanimals, and the sun, our star, that vast office\nof love, the one we sit in once, and read\ntogether twice, the third time bosomed in\nthe future.

    "'Twas in the year of 1887, and on the 28th of September,\nWhich many people of Honan, in China, will long remember;\nEspecially those that survived the mighty deluge,\nThat fled to the mountains, and tops of trees, for refuge.\nThe river burst its embankments suddenly at dead of night,\nAnd the rushing torrent swept all before it left and right;\nAll over the province of Honan, which for its fertility,\nIs commonly called by historians, the garden of China.\nThe river was at its fullest when the embankment gave way,\nAnd when the people heard it, oh! horror and dismay;\n'Twas then fathers and mothers leaped from their beds without delay,\nAnd some saved themselves from being drowned, but thousands were swept away.\nOh! it was a horrible and most pitiful scene,\nTo hear fathers and mothers and their children loudly scream;\nAs the merciless water encircled they bodies around,\nWhile the water spirits laughed to see them drowned.\nOh! heaven, it must have been an appalling sight,\nTo witness in the dead stillness of the night\nFrantic fathers and mothers, struggling hard against the roaring flood,\nTo save themselves and little ones, their own. flesh and blood.\nThe watchmen tried to patch the breach, but it was all in vain,\nBecause the banks were sodden with the long prolonged rain;\nAnd driven along by a high wind, which brought the last strain,\nWhich caused the water with resistless fury to spread o'er the plain.\nAnd the torrent poured into the valley of the La Chia river,\nSweeping thousands of the people before it ere a helping hand could them deliver;\nOh! it was horrible to hear the crashing of houses fallen on every side,\nAs the flood of rushing waters spread far and wide.\nThe Chinese offer sacrifices to the water spirits twice a year,\nAnd whether the water spirits or God felt angry I will not aver;\nBut perhaps God has considered such sacrifices a sin,\nAnd has drowned so many thousands of them for not worshipping Him.\nHow wonderful are the works of God,\nAt times among His people abroad;\nTherefore, let us be careful of what we do or say,\nFor fear God doth suddenly take our lives away.\nThe province of Honan is about half the size of Scotland,\nDotted over with about 3000 villages, most grand;\nAnd inhabited by millions of people of every degree,\nAnd these villages, and people were transformed into a raging sea.\nThe deluge swept on over the fertile and well-cultivated land,\nAnd the rushing of the mighty torrent no power could withstand;\nAnd the appalling torrent was about twenty feet deep,\nAnd with resistless fury everything before it it did sweep.\nMethinks I see the waste of surging waters, and hear its deafening roar,\nAnd on its surface I see corpses of men and women by the score;\nAnd the merciless torrent in the darkness of the night,\nSportively tossing them about, oh! what a horrible sight.\nBesides there were buffaloes and oxen, timber, straw, and grain,\nAlso three thousand villages were buried beneath the waters of the plain;\nAnd multitudes beneath their own roofs have found a watery grave,\nWhile struggling hard, no doubt, poor souls their lives to save.\nTherefore good people at home or abroad,\nBe advised by me and trust more in God,\nThan the people of Honan, the benighted Chinese,\nFor fear God punished you likewise for your iniquities.",

    "Are you ok if tomarrow is the end? Would you be a hero for someone in need? Would you care, or stand and watch? If you knew you could make a difference, would you? If you were one vioce, and this was the last chance to be heard, would you take advantage of the moment and scream out your the word? Would you help someone who you dispised? Would you help someone when you have enough on your plate as it is? Would you help a homeless person find a home, and give them food? If you were with your friends and they were making fun of a person who would be considered a geek or nerd, which side would you be on? would you sacrafice your time to help another, no matter how late it is or who it is?   The world would be a better place it we just helped each other...I know that sounds impossible, but in reality...nothing is impossible if we just put our minds to it and stop being selfish. If we took the time to help someone, then they would probably take the time to help someone else and so on. But it takes more than one person to make a diffrence. It takes all of us. If we did this earlier we might not have had so many wars, therefore so many deaths. If we took the time to do something that really matters the world would be a safer and nicer place to live. I might only be sixteen but that doesn't mean I don't know anything. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that we have to care in order to make the world a better place.  here are some facts that will maybe encourage you to send this poem to others so that we can make a difference and save some lives......1.)  In a recent national survey of students in grades 6 to 10,13% reported bullying others,11% reported being the target of school bullies, and another 6% said they bullied others and were bullied themselves.    2.)  Teen bullying can lead teenagers tense, anxious, and afraid. Some teens feel compelled to take drastic measures, such as carrying weapons to school for protection or violent revenge. Others in desperation even consider suicide.     3.) By 2002,28% of the woman who had reported depression symptoms in 1995 said they'd experienced dating violence or injury from a partner, compared with only 18% of woman who didn't report depression.   4.)  1,439 teens will attempt sucicide in the next 24 hours.6 of them will end in death.   5.) Remember that any ongoing conflicts between a parent and child can fuel the fire for a teen who is feeling isolated, misunderstood, devalued, or suicidal. Get help to air family problems and resolve them in a construcive way.   6.) at last count, there were more than 24,500 different gangs around the country, and more than 772,500 teens and young adults were members of gangs. Some gang members are as young as 12, the average age is about 17 to 18 years old.   7.) Teens join gangs for a variety of reasons. Some are seeking excitment; others are looking for prestige, protection, a chance to make money, or a sense of belonging.---If we make a chioce to be the voice for those who won't speak up for themselves, how many lives would we save? If it was ur kid who got shot because of a disgruntal teen was being picked on and decided to bring a gun to shcool. so please spread the mesage to care and be a hero.",

When I lay there in wait for the fun to begin.\nShe came in and hopped in beside me and landed on that lizzard.\nShe let out the awfulest blood curdling scream I ever heard.Then she started to cry. Then she screamed again. Then she cried some more.\nThen she finally got her breath.\n\"O.K. You jerk. Take that lizzard and get out the door.\"\nI put the lizzard in my dresser drawer before I went out the door.I thought our marriage had come to an end.\nI promised her I'd never do that again.\nAll the people in town told my wife that she had married a clown that would never settle down.\nI learned something that night when we had our first fight. If you treat your wife with respect and don't act like a jerk, your marriage is bound to work and she will even iron you shirts.\nYou can't expect her to earn your living. You've got to get off your duff and earn some of that spending stuff.\nYou may not have much money.\nBut you will alwyas have your honey. Which is worth more than all the money. You've got to settle down and quit your fooling around.\nTrying to paint the town.\nYou can't sit in a bar.\nAnd make the payment on your car.\nThe other side of the street may look greener, poison oak may look like four leave clover. But you will know the difference when it's all over.\nMy wife and I have been married almost fifty years now and that lizzard is still in my dresser drawer.",

' was the gladiators' cry\nIn the arena, standing face to face\nWith death and with the Roman populace.\nO ye familiar scenes,- ye groves of pine,\nThat once were mine and are no longer mine,-\nThou river, widening through the meadows green\nTo the vast sea, so near and yet unseen,-\nYe halls, in whose seclusion and repose\nPhantoms of fame, like exhalations, rose\nAnd vanished,- we who are about to die,\nSalute you; earth and air and sea and sky,\nAnd the Imperial Sun that scatters down\nHis sovereign splendors upon grove and town.\nYe do not answer us! ye do not hear!\nWe are forgotten; and in your austere\nAnd calm indifference, ye little care\nWhether we come or go, or whence or where.\nWhat passing generations fill these halls,\nWhat passing voices echo from these walls,\nYe heed not; we are only as the blast,\nA moment heard, and then forever past.\nNot so the teachers who in earlier days\nLed our bewildered feet through learning's maze;\nThey answer us- alas! what have I said?\nWhat greetings come there from the voiceless dead?\nWhat salutation, welcome, or reply?\nWhat pressure from the hands that lifeless lie?\nThey are no longer here; they all are gone\nInto the land of shadows,- all save one.\nHonor and reverence, and the good repute\nThat follows faithful service as its fruit,\nBe unto him, whom living we salute.\nThe great Italian poet, when he made\nHis dreadful journey to the realms of shade,\nMet there the old instructor of his youth,\nAnd cried in tones of pity and of ruth:\n'Oh, never from the memory of my heart\nYour dear, paternal image shall depart,\nWho while on earth, ere yet by death surprised,\nTaught me how mortals are immortalized;\nHow grateful am I for that patient care\nAll my life long my language shall declare.'\nTo-day we make the poet's words our own,\nAnd utter them in plaintive undertone;\nNor to the living only be they said,\nBut to the other living called the dead,\nWhose dear, paternal images appear\nNot wrapped in gloom, but robed in sunshine here;\nWhose simple lives, complete and without flaw,\nWere part and parcel of great Nature's law;\nWho said not to their Lord, as if afraid,\n'Here is thy talent in a napkin laid,'\nBut labored in their sphere, as men who live\nIn the delight that work alone can give.\nPeace be to them; eternal peace and rest,\nAnd the fulfilment of the great behest:\n'Ye have been faithful over a few things,\nOver ten cities shall ye reign as kings.'\nAnd ye who fill the places we once filled,\nAnd follow in the furrows that we tilled,\nYoung men, whose generous hearts are beating high,\nWe who are old, and are about to die,\nSalute you; hail you; take your hands in ours,\nAnd crown you with our welcome as with flowers!\nHow beautiful is youth! how bright it gleams\nWith its illusions, aspirations, dreams!\nBook of Beginnings, Story without End,\nEach maid a heroine, and each man a friend!\nAladdin's Lamp, and Fortunatus' Purse,\nThat holds the treasures of the universe!\nAll possibilities are in its hands,\nNo danger daunts it, and no foe withstands;\nIn its sublime audacity of faith,\n'Be thou removed! ' it to the mountain saith,\nAnd with ambitious feet, secure and proud,\nAscends the ladder leaning on the cloud!\nAs ancient Priam at the Scæan gate\nSat on the walls of Troy in regal state\nWith the old men, too old and weak to fight,\nChirping like grasshoppers in their delight\nTo see the embattled hosts, with spear and shield,\nOf Trojans and Achaians in the field;\nSo from the snowy summits of our years\nWe see you in the plain, as each appears,\nAnd question of you; asking, 'Who is he\nThat towers above the others? Which may be\nAtreides, Menelaus, Odysseus,\nAjax the great, or bold Idomeneus? '\nLet him not boast who puts his armor on\nAs he who puts it off, the battle done.\nStudy yourselves; and most of all note well\nWherein kind Nature meant you to excel.\nNot every blossom ripens into fruit;\nMinerva, the inventress of the flute,\nFlung it aside, when she her face surveyed\nDistorted in a fountain as she played;\nThe unlucky Marsyas found it, and his fate\nWas one to make the bravest hesitate.\nWrite on your doors the saying wise and old,\n'Be bold! be bold! ' and everywhere, 'Be bold;\nBe not too bold! ' Yet better the excess\nThan the defect; better the more than less;\nBetter like Hector in the field to die,\nThan like a perfumed Paris turn and fly.\nAnd now, my classmates; ye remaining few\nThat number not the half of those we knew,\nYe, against whose familiar names not yet\nThe fatal asterisk of death is set,\nYe I salute! The horologe of Time\nStrikes the half-century with a solemn chime,\nAnd summons us together once again,\nThe joy of meeting not unmixed with pain.\nWhere are the others? Voices from the deep\nCaverns of darkness answer me: 'They sleep! '\nI name no names; instinctively I feel\nEach at some well-remembered grave will kneel,\nAnd from the inscription wipe the weeds and moss,\nFor every heart best knoweth its own loss.\nI see their scattered gravestones gleaming white\nThrough the pale dusk of the impending night;\nO'er all alike the impartial sunset throws\nIts golden lilies mingled with the rose;\nWe give to each a tender thought, and pass\nOut of the graveyards with their tangled grass,\nUnto these scenes frequented by our feet\nWhen we were young, and life was fresh and sweet.\nWhat shall I say to you? What can I say\nBetter than silence is? When I survey\nThis throng of faces turned to meet my own,\nFriendly and fair, and yet to me unknown,\nTransformed the very landscape seems to be;\nIt is the same, yet not the same to me.\nSo many memories crowd upon my brain,\nSo many ghosts are in the wooded plain,\nI fain would steal away, with noiseless tread,\nAs from a house where some one lieth dead.\nI cannot go; - I pause; - I hesitate;\nMy feet reluctant linger at the gate;\nAs one who struggles in a troubled dream\nTo speak and cannot, to myself I seem.\nVanish the dream! Vanish the idle fears!\nVanish the rolling mists of fifty years!\nWhatever time or space may intervene,\nI will not be a stranger in this scene.\nHere every doubt, all indecision, ends;\nHail, my companions, comrades, classmates, friends!\nAh me! the fifty years since last we met\nSeem to me fifty folios bound and set\nBy Time, the great transcriber, on his shelves,\nWherein are written the histories of ourselves.\nWhat tragedies, what comedies, are there;\nWhat joy and grief, what rapture and despair!\nWhat chronicles of triumph and defeat,\nOf struggle, and temptation, and retreat!\nWhat records of regrets, and doubts, and fears!\nWhat pages blotted, blistered by our tears!\nWhat lovely landscapes on the margin shine,\nWhat sweet, angelic faces, what divine\nAnd holy images of love and trust,\nUndimmed by age, unsoiled by damp or dust!\nWhose hand shall dare to open and explore\nThese volumes, closed and clasped forevermore?\nNot mine. With reverential feet I pass;\nI hear a voice that cries, 'Alas! alas!\nWhatever hath been written shall remain,\nNor be erased nor written o'er again;\nThe unwritten only still belongs to thee:\nTake heed, and ponder well what that shall be.'\nAs children frightened by a thunder-cloud\nAre reassured if some one reads aloud\nA tale of wonder, with enchantment fraught,\nOr wild adventure, that diverts their thought,\nLet me endeavor with a tale to chase\nThe gathering shadows of the time and place,\nAnd banish what we all too deeply feel\nWholly to say, or wholly to conceal.\nIn mediæval Rome, I know not where,\nThere stood an image with its arm in air,\nAnd on its lifted finger, shining clear,\nA golden ring with the device, 'Strike here! '\nGreatly the people wondered, though none guessed\nThe meaning that these words but half expressed,\nUntil a learned clerk, who at noonday\nWith downcast eyes was passing on his way,\nPaused, and observed the spot, and marked it well,\nWhereon the shadow of the finger fell;\nAnd, coming back at midnight, delved, and found\nA secret stairway leading underground.\nDown this he passed into a spacious hall,\nLit by a flaming jewel on the wall;\nAnd opposite, in threatening attitude,\nWith bow and shaft a brazen statue stood.\nUpon its forehead, like a coronet,\nWere these mysterious words of menace set:\n'That which I am, I am; my fatal aim\nNone can escape, not even yon luminous flame! '\nMidway the hall was a fair table placed,\nWith cloth of gold, and golden cups enchased\nWith rubies, and the plates and knives were gold,\nAnd gold the bread and viands manifold.\nAround it, silent, motionless, and sad,\nWere seated gallant knights in armor clad,\nAnd ladies beautiful with plume and zone,\nBut they were stone, their hearts within were stone;\nAnd the vast hall was filled in every part\nWith silent crowds, stony in face and heart.\nLong at the scene, bewildered and amazed\nThe trembling clerk in speechless wonder gazed;\nThen from the table, by his greed made bold,\nHe seized a goblet and a knife of gold,\nAnd suddenly from their seats the guests upsprang,\nThe vaulted ceiling with loud clamors rang,\nThe archer sped his arrow, at their call,\nShattering the lambent jewel on the wall,\nAnd all was dark around and overhead; -\nStark on the floor the luckless clerk lay dead!\nThe writer of this legend then records\nIts ghostly application in these words:\nThe image is the Adversary old,\nWhose beckoning finger points to realms of gold;\nOur lusts and passions are the downward stair\nThat leads the soul from a diviner air;\nThe archer, Death; the flaming jewel, Life;\nTerrestrial goods, the goblet and the knife;\nThe knights and ladies, all whose flesh and bone\nBy avarice have been hardened into stone;\nThe clerk, the scholar whom the love of pelf\nTempts from his books and from his nobler self.\nThe scholar and the world! The endless strife,\nThe discord in the harmonies of life!\nThe love of learning, the sequestered nooks,\nAnd all the sweet serenity of books;\nThe market-place, the eager love of gain,\nWhose aim is vanity, and whose end is pain!\nBut why, you ask me, should this tale be told\nTo men grown old, or who are growing old?\nIt is too late! Ah, nothing is too late\nTill the tired heart shall cease to palpitate.\nCato learned Greek at eighty; Sophocles\nWrote his grand Oedipus, and Simonides\nBore off the prize of verse from his compeers,\nWhen each had numbered more than fourscore years,\nAnd Theophrastus, at fourscore and ten,\nHad but begun his 'Characters of Men.'\nChaucer, at Woodstock with the nightingales,\nAt sixty wrote the Canterbury Tales;\nGoethe at Weimar, toiling to the last,\nCompleted Faust when eighty years were past.\nThese are indeed exceptions; but they show\nHow far the gulf-stream of our youth may flow\nInto the arctic regions of our lives,\nWhere little else than life itself survives.\nAs the barometer foretells the storm\nWhile still the skies are clear, the weather warm\nSo something in us, as old age draws near,\nBetrays the pressure of the atmosphere.\nThe nimble mercury, ere we are aware,\nDescends the elastic ladder of the air;\nThe telltale blood in artery and vein\nSinks from its higher levels in the brain;\nWhatever poet, orator, or sage\nMay say of it, old age is still old age.\nIt is the waning, not the crescent moon;\nThe dusk of evening, not the blaze of noon;\nIt is not strength, but weakness; not desire,\nBut its surcease; not the fierce heat of fire,\nThe burning and consuming element,\nBut that of ashes and of embers spent,\nIn which some living sparks we still discern,\nEnough to warm, but not enough to burn.\nWhat then? Shall we sit idly down and say\nThe night hath come; it is no longer day?\nThe night hath not yet come; we are not quite\nCut off from labor by the failing light;\nSomething remains for us to do or dare;\nEven the oldest tree some fruit may bear;\nNot Oedipus Coloneus, or Greek Ode,\nOr tales of pilgrims that one morning rode\nOut of the gateway of the Tabard Inn,\nBut other something, would we but begin;\nFor age is opportunity no less\nThan youth itself, though in another dress,\nAnd as the evening twilight fades away\nThe sky is filled with stars, invisible by day."

    " Two Poems From The War \n\nBy Lieutenant G.A. Tinnepower, 1st Lincolnshire Regiment (Territorial Force).\n\nThese two poems are interesting because they give a feel for the conditions of the front line, but also because they are so matter-of-fact. There is little of the usual sentimentality of poems about war, and none of the jingoism.\n\nThe first poem, \"Nobody Wonders\" struck me immediately as being evocative of the front line experience, but says it in a very matter-of-fact way. There is no self-pity, or longing, or sense of injustice - just a bald statement of fact. And of course, that is how the soldiers wanted it to be. They did not want to be remembered as victims, but as survivors.\n\nThe second poem, \"It's A Queer Time\" is not so much a poem about the war, as a poem about the effect of the war on the poet. Again, there is little emotion shown, but the message is clear enough. War makes people numb to death, and hence to life. Ironically, it is only by experiencing death that we can fully appreciate life.\n\nNobody wonders, nobody cares,\nIf we go over the top tomorrow,\nOr if anything else happens to us.\n\nIf we are killed, well, that's how it is;\nAnd if we aren't, well, that's how it is.\n\nIf we are wounded, we shan't be able to drink beer,\nAnd if we aren't, we'll jolly well drink it.\n\nIt's a funny sort of war, anyhow.\n\nNobody ever worries about me,\nIf I'm in any danger, or discomfort,\nOr if I have got dysentery,\nOr if my nerves are a bit dicky;\nIf I go 'long with it, that's how it is;\nAnd if I don't, well, that's how it is.\n\nIt's a funny sort of war, ain't it?\n\nNobody wonders why we went in;\nIf we had taken Germany's offer,\nWhich was undoubtedly a good one,\nWe might have been home by now.\nBut we did not, so here we are -\nThere's no sense in getting glum.\n\nIt's a queer time, everybody says,\nBut when you've been here a while,\nYou sort of wonder",

    "On September 25th I came to the realization that one need not be born again in order to become fully human. At first I thought this was a mere euphemism to express the fact that I was already human. In actuality however, it is a more profound realization, one which I have only been able to come to with time and experience. I would be lying if I said I never thought of this realization but as time progressed as I came to see things more clearly and make sense of other peoples' philosophies, I realized that everything I was learning was applicable to my predicament. I have finally realized that, as was my dad in God, I could be truly happy if I could \"tame\" myself. Perhaps he was the first human that I thought of in the second person. I would much rather have my dad alive if only for the simple fact that I know that his last moments were filled with happiness and joy. The following comes from a poem titled \"It's all about the Journey\" from wordfountains.net: I will start by giving each of you the basic definition of what shamanism is. Shamanism is an ancient religious system based upon a belief in spirits, called \"shaman,\" who exist outside the realm of humanity. Shamanism's greatest power is that no outside force can exist to rule them; they are their own rulers. There are three types of shapeshifting shamans in all of recorded history: those who can command a spirit with words, those who can control spirit through dance, and those who can control or communicate with spirits without words. Shamanism is an old and noble art. Shamanism is the art of becoming one's own god. To become a shaman is to be reborn and to find oneself anew. In the word of some shamans, \"taming yourself\" is the act of self-discovery and self-knowledge. This word refers to the natural process of experiencing oneself and of discovering one's place in the universe. To become an accomplished shaman is to explore one's own self on an inner level of consciousness. The shaman can be used by a person who has accepted the reality of both external and internal forces. He is most useful to an individual who is seeking to understand the laws of nature and the origin of one's own thoughts and emotions. The shaman is a wise and selfless leader, and his work is to guide the leader's",
    "I am not sure if I have ever been so angry as when I read this poem, which was written by an anonymous author in the early 1990s. The poem describes how a child was killed and then buried alive. It's a chilling tale that has haunted me for years.\n\nIn the late 1980s, my mother had just moved to New York City with her husband and two young children. She worked at a small restaurant on the Lower East Side called the Red Lion. One day she came home to find that one of their employees had been murdered. Her name was Mary Ann Nichols.\n\nMary Ann was a beautiful woman who loved animals and had a great sense of humor. She was also very intelligent and well-read. When she heard about the murder of another employee, she decided to write a letter to the police explaining what happened. She wrote it out on a piece of paper and taped it to the door of the restaurant.\n\nWhen Mary Ann arrived at work the next morning, she found that someone had broken into her apartment and stolen all of her belongings. They left behind a note saying they were going to kill her because she knew too much.\n\nShe went back to her apartment and locked herself inside. She waited until nightfall before opening the door. As soon as she did, she saw a man standing outside her window. He told her he wanted to talk to her. Mary Ann asked him why he wanted to speak to her. He said that he was looking for his daughter. Mary Ann didn't know her daughter, but she thought she might be able to help him find her.\n\nHe explained that his daughter had been kidnapped and raped by a group of men. He said that he had taken her to a secluded area where he had tied her up and beaten her. Then he cut off her head and threw it over a cliff. He said that he would never see her again.\n\nMary Ann agreed to meet him at the edge of the cliff. After some time, he returned to tell her that he had found her body. He took her hand and led her down to the water below. He told her that he could no longer feel her pulse or hear her breathing. He told her that she was dead.\n\nAfter he finished speaking, Mary Ann began to cry uncontrollably. She tried to pull away from him",
    "I'm getting up to my knees and sniffing Chicago as I've never smelled it. Every time I come close, she's got another gift for me: roses, or reds and purple hearts, or white muslins, with a dash that goes straight down and makes it look so soft… You know there are only three seasons in this city–fall, winter and summer–if you can't get them all, don't be surprised if you aren't warm enough. When I ask the old lady at her door about this, she says, \"Oh,\" and puts the card back inside its box, before saying the same thing every time to anyone who knocks on the front door: No, no, just an old man… Then later when I try again to visit the doctor who sees one patient after another, without knowing why the day turns into four months instead of seven months? They say their patients have something important to tell them–because they were once young themselves, but now they still suffer, like everybody else whose pain has gone out of control because of age. The reason these people can keep it together through those long hard years, they told me over a drink in a dimly lit bar that had been converted into a hospice room, where we'd talked about the world as it ought to be, not as it is. It was true that they lived in poverty, but they said it more from shame than anything else – even though they didn't live at home because this community isn't real life…. This woman knew her own heart better than any other person I ever met and yet she told me how others tried to help but couldn't; and that many men left too soon, like most of their sons leaving their families behind. She wanted very much to make things right, and still she'd given up hope entirely.\n\nSo how do you feel about November 30th? Do you like it? How does your city compare to other cities in the U.S.?

    "At one time in my life, I traveled with some other fellows. The word traveling brings to mind distant places and a goal or aspiration – that's what they were interested in. For years, when I told them about it, all I got was snorting laughter. I finally realized we had different priorities on how to spend our vacation. A more important issue than whether we were traveling, the traveling itself would have been unimportant were this the extent of our relationship – as each of us had plenty of others without which they could not travel nor be travel companions. That particular group did exist: We called ourselves the Traveling Dudes. It seemed like quite an accomplishment to find travelers.\n\nI went away looking for adventure. He went looking out for love. They didn't meet again until long after we left home.\n\nThe point of their meeting (if you can call it that) was that they each had a different interest. Our adventures were similar in nature, if differing from person to person. If the distance between us didn't seem far enough, then we'd always talk about our adventures – even if we could see nothing of them from our vantage point.\n\nFor a while, things looked bad for each other: After leaving New York City, he wrote me on the train down south \"We shouldn't stop here.\" I replied \"I think I know what you mean.\" Not long after, his family moved back into the East Coast which took him up to Rhode Island - where, according to his journal, he never stopped loving me. His sister asked him why he wanted to come back so soon, to which he answered, \"... because now I'm sure there's no place like home anymore…\" So I stayed. He stayed with us all year…and was only gone on another few vacations since his return from our journey across America. And despite leaving for months and coming back almost every spring, summer vacation continued right up through Thanksgiving at Thanksgiving. In fact, we'd stay longer in one place over the whole year (because, at least then, the weather cooperated!) The fact they hadn't met again for years didn't really matter. Even though he wasn't alive while we shared those trips through Europe or Australia, I still saw him occasionally. When we met when we were both back, he said nothing happened, but I read his thoughts the instant he laid eyes on me when everyone else had",
    "\"The Cats Song. Some things are so pure and simple.\n\nSome things are a little crooked.\n\nBut some are a whole lot crazier.\n\nThese are the things that make me smile my most.\n\nWhen the cat is cowering in fear,\n\nAnd I come to the table by myself:\n\nThe cussing is so loud,\n\nAnd all the meat is so smelly,\n\nThe cuddles are so warm and cuddly,\n\nAnd I like the taste of meat just right,\n\nAnd when I taste it, it's pretty good;\n\nAnd I wish that the cats would come and play.\n\nThere's no place to do it but here,\n\nAnd I like the way you keep yourself so clean,\n\nAnd you keep all the food from the cats in the kitchen,\n\nAnd you're always feeding 'em when they come in,\n\nAnd they seem to come in with some awful noise,\n\nBut you're quick to laugh, though they might be mad;\n\nYou look like a crazy cat lady,\n\nAnd you've got a lot of brains,\n\nAnd you seem so happy,\n\nBut just wait till you hear 'em moan.\n\nThe next time you go to see them, they'll take everything,\n\nYou won't be able to walk outside in peace.\n\nYou'll have to call out for help from the neighbor,\n\nAnd I bet they'll run for their lives.\" -- Robert Aitken, \"Cats Song\" by Robert Aitken.

At the very beginning (when\n\nthe sky was still so dark and filled up with the white of the snow)\n\nthe day was a dark, black, icy, empty one.

In fact, nothing existed in the sky, it\n\ndid not matter what part of it had snow because all the sky had\n\nsparkles, it was the only thing that mattered — because it fell and fell\n\nand nothing could stop it. And the day came and without a single\n\nmoving thing outside its surface, it was as empty as a piece of the\n\nuniverse.\n\nAnd the sun came out. From within, it came into our world.\n\nIt was the sun that created everything. It was the sun that had\n\ngrown to its enormous size by being so very very, very, warm.\n\nThe sun had its own existence in the emptiness of the sky,\n\nit was its sun.

    "I'm not sure if I've ever been so happy to be alive as when I was in my twenties, and I had long blonde hair. It was just me and my best friend, and we were both really into music. We'd go out on our own, or with friends, but mostly it was just us hanging out at home listening to music. And then one day she said something that made me realize how much I loved her. She told me that she wanted to get married someday, and that she didn't want to wait until she was older. So I asked her what she meant by that. She said that she thought marriage would mean more than anything else, because she knew that she wouldn't have to worry about being single for very long. That's when I realized that I could never live without her. I couldn't imagine living without her. I love you, girl with the long blond hair. You're the only person who can make me feel like this every day. I know that you'll always be there for me, no matter what happens. I love you, girl with the long blond hair.\n\nAdvertisements",

    "\"The Evil Seekers was written during the Second World War in English by John Keats. \"The Evil Seekers\" was the first of his 'lost' poetry and was discovered in 1922 by The Black Prince in a volume called Poems by Various Writers. His poem is based on \"The Evil Queen\" in a short story by Lord Byron. The poet used three images--the woman as a thief, the woman and the bird, and the man as a thief--and used a language that is somewhat reminiscent of an ironic English verse.\"\n\nThe poem concludes with a warning of the dangers of \"sinners\",\n\n\"But what is it, that we think in sin? It is not the lust of a man which makes evil in his heart, it is his ignorance. A man in his own power may do good: for our power lies in God that gives us power over sin.\"\n\nThe full poem can be read in the original from John Keats' website here.\n\nThe other poem in poemhunter.com's collection of Keats poems is titled \"Lady in Waiting\",\n\nThe poem \"The Evil Seekers\" is part of what is known as Keats' \"lost\" poetry. Keats believed that the poems could be recovered after his death (according to Keats biographer Charles Burney), which raises some interesting questions. How did Keats know that in 1921 he had lost the poem? Was Keats trying to recast the mystery behind his poem to his admirers (as the black prince claimed that Keats had attempted to do to his poem), or did he just have a strong sense of the poem, and believed without a doubt that his poem would be found one day? It's a bit of a conundrum, but one that we as modern poets must learn to handle. Keats was an exceptionally prolific writer, as the above quote attests.\n\nWhy did Keats write the poems in the way that he did? To understand this question one must first understand the nature of poetic inspiration. There is a concept in psychology called the Inspiration Dilemma. This basically questions the following question: in order to complete an idea, are one's thoughts already pre-existent and in any way pre-planned or are the thoughts just born out of one's own imagination or are one's mental processes simply not being followed through correctly?

    "Dear Father, forgive me For not saying goodbye to you yesterday But tell me that on the day when I should Have been away You sent for Me. Yes, say it now, as if there was one night or even one day We had more than this in Between And I'd do anything – everything Even love. When we were young I hoped That with such an angelic face On fire would be a sign Of joy and hope at Christmas The sun would start rising but it did Not rise on its own. As we learned more about each other She loved less and you cared more And I learned how much I could never Give back Your love by my words What better way to repay Than by your example. So it was not just that she didn't come Home for Christmas, nor even A single day – not a blink of time at all. I think the lesson that day was I have so many things I want To share with someone who shares them So maybe If they too are ready When the magic happens what might happen to us Both Then I don't wish anything wrong With those living in the shadows that I will be waiting as long as our memories Still burn into my eyes that they may be lost to a world of pain But perhaps, someday, There might be another chance. Where will it exist I feel I don't know, yet the stars are out in blue fields Like snowdrops caught in sunlight shining All over their beautiful faces Now in every dream I'm sure to find something like her. I see why people call New York City New York. It feels more alive And more amazing Every morning it's still winter when I get up in the morning A little more blue and the sound of sirens sounding in the distance but then again They're always gone soon the sun comes and nothing ever changes Maybe someday It'll change and you won't need this letter anymore My voice might shake around here And when I cry I'll scream again so loud But today is an ordinary Sunday morning. Perhaps I've forgotten just how important all of it Was to our relationship but now in all truth there isn't time for things like that So why worry about past regrets?

    "I was born in a small town, and my parents were both teachers. They had me when they were young, but it wasn't until I was about ten that I started to really notice them. It was then that I realized how much they loved each other. When I was eleven, my mother told me she wanted to get married. She said she didn't want to wait for her father's death, so she decided to marry him right away. I remember thinking, \"Wow! That's great!\" But as soon as we got engaged, things changed. The wedding was held at a church, and there were no bridesmaids or groomsmen. Instead, all the guests were invited to sit on the floor with us. We sat together, and everyone else stood around us. There was no music, no dancing, nothing. Just us sitting there, looking at each other. And then, after the ceremony, my mother asked if anyone would like to go home. Everyone did. So she took us back to our house, and we stayed there for two weeks. Then she brought us back to school. I don't know what happened next. Maybe she just forgot about us. Or maybe she thought we'd be better off without her. Either way, I never saw her again. I think she moved out before I turned twelve. I'm not sure why. I guess I just assumed she was dead. I've always been curious about what happened to her. I wonder if she ever found someone who cared enough about her to take care of her? I wonder if she even knew where she was living. I wonder if she ever felt safe. I wonder if she ever felt happy. I wonder if she ever felt anything at all. I wonder if she ever felt love. I wonder if she ever felt anything at all.",

    "I'm not sure if I've ever been to a football game, but I know that it's something you don't forget. It's like being in a movie theater or a concert hall. You can feel the energy and excitement as people are cheering for their team. The crowd is so loud and passionate that you can hear every word they say. And when the players run onto the field, you're just as excited to see them as everyone else.\n\nIt's an experience that lasts forever.\n\nBut what happens after the game? What do you do with all those memories? Do you go back home and tell your friends about how great it was? Or do you keep going out there again and again until you get tired of it?\n\nWell, I have some good news for you! There's a way to make sure you never forget football again.\n\nYou can take a picture of yourself at a football game and post it on Facebook. Then, whenever someone asks you where you were during the game, you'll be able to point them right back to this page.\n\nAnd that's exactly what I did. After my first game, I posted a photo of myself at the stadium. I didn't even realize it at the time, but I had taken a picture of myself at a football game.\n\nNow, I wasn't planning on posting this picture on Facebook. But then I saw another fan who also took a picture of himself at the same game. He posted his picture too. So now we had two pictures of me at the same game.\n\nSo I decided to share both photos together on Facebook.\n\nAfter seeing these two pictures side by side, I realized that I could use one of my own pictures to create a new image. That's why I chose to post this picture of me at the game.\n\nThis picture has become very popular on Facebook.

    "\"Balls Of Fire\" by Mark Twain (1835)\n\nIn March, 1855 Mark Twain wrote the ballad \"Balls Of Fire\" in the town square at Westport, Connecticut, during a visit from his friend and fellow satirist John Ruskin. Ruskin was well known for taking satirical liberties with the truth in his letters to the editor. A year earlier, Twain and Dr. Horace Greeley had collaborated to publish the satirical travel and travel guide \"Life Among the Chaldaeans\", an account of life among the inhabitants of the northernmost part of Iran. But their collaboration had resulted in what became one of the most discussed incidents in modern history-the attack by a drunken sailor who had landed in the town of Westport, Rhode Island, and, having been informed that the town was inhabited entirely by chaldaeans, had killed forty-six men and raped ten women, among them \"Hazel\". Twain was aghast. \"The best thing we can do to teach them to stay away from us will be to drive them into a hole if we can do so,\" he wrote. The verse was a plea for action against the criminal. \"You can't drive them out forever/No/We can't do that/And neither can you/No/And it won't do to fight it in the streets,\" Twain wrote, going on to warn that the residents of Rhode Island have \"a history of lynching blacks\".\n\nThe incident drew much attention. But it's not as though Twain was above addressing his audience on a personal level. In a letter published in the New York Journal in January, 1856, Twain writes a brief love poem to \"Lusty Lulu\", a female friend who was having a hard time living on their own from a life in prostitution, and who needed his financial help. Twain is clearly referring to \"Balls Of Fire\" in one of his letters. \"Dear Lulu and Lulu,\" he writes, \"I'm waiting for the ball to break out and your husband to come home. So will you come with me now? No? Come when? All right. I am very anxious. Please write when you are able. Let me know you come. I want every detail. You really must get his hands wet so that he might take revenge on you.\" It's clear that Twain saw this incident,",

    "I don't know who my best friend is, but I'm pretty sure she's not you! You can have everybody in the world as your friends. And they make me smile all day long; it doesn't matter whether they're good or not. I just feel so lucky to have any kind of love at all. How can I be alone? Some nights I could use someone to tell me if anyone else was lying when he said he loved me - but that would require him to do things for me that I wouldn't enjoy doing myself. That's impossible anyway, because there are people who only say nice things about me and leave off when I ask them stupid questions which aren't easy to answer... But that isn't really enough either since I keep meeting people and everyone says the same thing (or worse). Sometimes they'll even go out on a limb with their friendship! No one ever does what he tells me not to. I try, though. You see people around here and they don't always act the way they were when you took care of them. I mean, we all know that there will always come a time when some jerk gets involved with her boyfriend, the neighbor kid decides to stay over, that girl who never bothered with grades ends up marrying this guy named J, the guy who talks too loud makes her cry, those guys who hate me get angry over nothing at all when that bitch dumps somebody else I used to think was my second cousin. Hell, sometimes I've fallen asleep and gotten back in bed without realizing just how many different people I'd just slept with. People change. They become rich and famous, spend five years behind bars or lose their children to mental illness before turning back into a nobody. Who knows what happens to people when they die? It wasn't fair, and you can blame me though... What goes down in a movie stays in a movie. The people you think got themselves fired up just like the real me did still haven't recovered yet. So when friends and old times collide on a Wednesday night, they tend to end up being more than a little drunker than usual... Why didn't they realize? Sometimes those times can come suddenly, if that drunk person who used to drive really badly has left town by the next morning... If only my closest friends knew the truth, they might not react that rudely, I swear! That's because I'm an idiot",
    "I find a little boy, the son of the sun. There are two ways of looking at things. I know that to love, when the sun is not bright, is true sorrow and will bring grief. But I am young and strong, and I know better. The son of the sun is good to eat and drink and play. He is the leader of the Muses. He rules the day, the night, the stars. He has many names: Ares, Apollo, Artemis, Hera, Zeus, Apollo of the Muses, Apollo Musagete Poetess, the Son of The Sun, The Son of the Sun. Why am I called The Son of The Sun? Because the day of his coming brings the first day of the festival of Musagete. At the end of the festival my family will go to heaven by the will of the Musagete. That is my family name. The sun is part of my name but the moon is not. Why the moon? Because of the Musagete? That is what the sun tells me. The Musagete lives in the sky but the son of the sun lives on earth; The Son of the Sun and the son of Hermes.\n\nThis poem continues to say how the Sun, when the time is right, changes into the son of the sun, and the moon takes on a similar role, the same role for both sun and moon. It also discusses how the moon, when the moon has her turn, has the role, the duties and duties for the Musagete. Also mentions how Artemis and Hera are the daughters of Aphrodite, Ares and Zeus.\n\nThis further proves that this poem does originate from the Greek era - there are many similarities in language and content to poems of that time (the name of the poem itself is similar to some poems in Homer). All these similarities support that it is a translation from the Greek era and it is from Greeks, Greek poets that composed and translated these poems.\n\nThe following is the poem the writer of the poem has placed on this site by way of a link:\n\nApollo Musagete Poetry And The Leader Of The Muses\n\nThe following is the poem the writer of the poem has placed on this site by way of a link\n\nApollo Musagete Poetry And The Leader Of the",

    "A day in bed, oh what a treat\nThe world outside fades from my feet\nI'll just lay here and rest my head\nAnd let my body have its sweet bread\n\nNo need for alarm clocks or bells\nMy sleep is all that I can tell\nI'll dream of fun and sunny days\nWhile my body heals in its own ways\n\nThe sheets are soft, the blanket too\nI'm warm and cozy, feeling brand new\nNo need to worry or stress\nJust me and my pillow, we're the best\n\nI'll read a book or watch a show\nOr maybe just close my eyes and go\nTo a place where sickness disappears\nAnd health and happiness appears\n\nSo bring on the tea and soup\nI'll drink them up with no doubt or group\nFor a sick day is always fun\nWhen you're surrounded by love, everyone!",
    "In the sun-kissed fields of youth,\nA legend grew, a hero born,\nWith a spirit fierce and true,\nHe played the game with heart and soul.\n\nHis feet moved swiftly, graceful dance,\nThe ball at his feet, a loyal friend,\nHe dribbled, kicked, and scored with ease,\nHis passion, a joy to behold.\n\nWith a grin that lit up the sky,\nHe chased each victory, never shy,\nHis will to win, a burning fire,\nIn every game, he never tired.\n\nHis teammates cheered, a bond so strong,\nTogether they fought, right and wrong,\nFor victory, they gave their all,\nIn the game, they stood tall.\n\nThe crowd watched, mesmerized,\nAs he weaved his magic, a wizard's spell,\nHis name echoed through the land,\nA boyhood hero, a legend grand.\n\nYears passed, the seasons changed,\nBut his love for the game remained,\nIn his heart, the passion still burned,\nA flame that never faded, never learned.\n\nFor in the game, he found his peace,\nA place where he could release,\nHis dreams, his hopes, his fears,\nA sanctuary, no tears.\n\nAnd though the years have gone,\nThe memories linger on,\nOf a boyhood hero, pure and true,\nA sporting legend, forever new.",
    "In twilight's hush, when worldly cares did sleep,\nI wandered lost in thoughts that would not cease.\nMy heart, aflame with passion's fiery sweep,\nDid yearn for love, yet knew not where to seek.\n\nThe stars above, they twinkled cold and bright,\nA celestial map that offered no insight.\nThe wind it whispered secrets of the night,\nYet none could guide me through this endless plight.\n\nIn darkness, I did stumble upon a path,\nThat led me forth to love's untimely wrath.\nA journey fraught with danger, fear and doubt,\nWhere every step did threaten to devour my soul's last shred of hope.\n\nBut still I walked on, driven by desire,\nTo find the love that set my spirit afire.\nAnd though the road was treacherous and long,\nI knew that love would make my heart strong.\n\nAlas! Before I loved, I lost my love,\nA sorrow that doth pierce my heart above.\nFor now I see, that love was never nigh,\nAnd in its absence, tears do fill my eye.",

    "In the snow-covered village, silent and still,\nA group of children gathered, their eyes aglow,\nThey huddled 'round a man, his face full of cheer,\nAs he began to tell a tale of a Christmas goose, dear.\n\nHe spoke of a bird, plump and proud,\nWith feathers soft as down, and a wattle loud,\nHe lived on a farm, with a flock of friends,\nBut he was different, he had a special end.\n\nHe was chosen by fate, to be the main course,\nOf a Christmas feast, a tradition, of course,\nBut the goose had other plans, he had a dream,\nTo fly away, and live life on his own scheme.\n\nHe waited patiently, for the perfect time,\nWhen the farmer was busy, and the coast was clear,\nHe spread his wings, and took to the sky,\nAway from the farm, he did fly.\n\nHe soared over fields, and houses too,\nWith a grin on his beak, and a twinkle in his eye,\nHe felt free at last, no more worry or fear,\nJust the thrill of flight, and the wind in his ear.\n\nBut as he flew, he saw a sight,\nThat made his heart sing, with delight,\nA group of children, with eyes aglow,\nWatching him fly, with wonder and woe.\n\nHe circled back, and landed with grace,\nIn the midst of the children, a happy face,\nThey cheered and clapped, with joy and glee,\nFor the Christmas goose, who had set them free.\n\nAnd so, the goose, with a heart full of cheer,\nBecame the star, of that Christmas year,\nHe brought joy to all, with his brave flight,\nAnd showed that even a goose, can be a shining light.",

As you can see, he wrote this from the perspective of a young boy. When I read this poem the very first time, I was immediately struck by the child's perspective in the poem. He is very curious about the chimney sweeps, as he thought their crying was unusual. Also, his mind immediately went to the \"negative\" to explain why they were so sad. I mean, most children in America today have never known what it's like to lose a family home, friends or relatives; nor have they ever have to experience what it may have been like to live when women had no real rights in society.\n\nBut here is where I'm heading with this poem: I think we as adults can sometimes get overly complicated in our thinking even when our lives go through \"ordinary\" changes. And there's no doubt about it, life does have changes we must adjust to. So, this poem really has two different parts to",
    "When I heard that the young had taken over the streets, protesting against climate change and demanding action on pollution, poverty and inequality; I smiled and congratulated myself for believing in the younger generation even when some people did not see any hope with them at all. But my smile turned sour the other day while watching videos of how thugs attacked our youthful ones to a point where they were bleeding as an act of suppressing their voices and putting their demands into mute. My heart broke when I came across comments by older women who said things like “We have always been here before them so why are they coming now?” (Margaret Gogo Gachia 2019), or saying ”they should stay up to date with the school syllabus”, implying that these kids should shut down and end their strike because maybe those topics such as Climate Change and Renewable Energy are still covered under science subjects that do not involve policy making? Can a person speak out about matters affecting the lives of people even if it’s beyond his area of knowledge? And can one only raise issues regarding climate change since he/she studied sciences in high school or university level? Do we really need scientists only to tell us what exactly is eating away mother earth and its creatures…do those guys understand too well why most forests are gone and why lakes water levels keep depleting? Who knows more between adults versus children…maybe you but ask yourself what have you done practically besides your social media posts? Did you even make an attempt on planting trees after having seen the horrors faced by forest conservancy officers especially during elections? Maybe your concern over tree cover loss stopped when you realized the forests and watersheds no longer benefited you directly anymore! For example there was less mist around you than yesterday meaning that rainfall would be reduced…then after seeing the benefits of having misty environment disappear off completely, maybe you then woke up to find new houses being constructed nearby resulting into increased pressure on water demand etc.. You must have quickly shifted your focus to other important issues right! By now ,these younger ones just started understanding the realities surrounding deforestation and lack of adequate investment into renewables….this led them into taking up serious action plans whereby they chose to go outside class and demonstrate over such environmental concerns. This made me think how can anyone look",
    "I think there are only two ideas in life to have; one, is that if i believed all things were perfect I would always see myself as perfectly unworthy and therefore everything around me is equally so or equal enough - but no matter which way you swing on it, the thing, itself remains as it was regardless of how many people call into question where its made or bought - it still lives like something never did live before and therefore will stay just because i am here as well. Or two, is that to be less then human can mean being less than an object within this world and if you look at the ground there are rocks scattered everywhere and even ones fallen away and out back I took some time out to place them gently aside- I knew they'd come with a purpose since they seemed part of an event bigger then what we might perceive at first sight. But more importantly after each rock fell off our path we found ourselves lost without directions until eventually finding something else entirely new along another road altogether far...\n\nThis is only the beginning. What follows this introduction (which gives background on why these poems were written) should hopefully help better understand where exactly all our minds had gotten us over such an extended period time when finally giving someone else permission actually means allowing their thoughts instead take hold! Enjoy!",

    "In the golden age of Rajputana,\nWhere love bloomed like a rose,\nAmidst warriors and kings,\nA tender romance arose.\n\nHer eyes were deep and dark,\nHer beauty pure and bright,\nShe captured the heart of a prince,\nIn the soft moonlit night.\n\nWith a love that burned like fire,\nAnd an passion that would not falter,\nThey danced beneath the stars,\nTheir hearts forever entwined together.\n\nIn the palace halls and gardens,\nTheir love was spoken in whispers,\nOf a bond that would last an eternity,\nA love that would never perish.\n\nBut fate had other plans,\nAs the winds of war began to blow,\nTheir love was tested,\nAs they were forced to part, and to go.\n\nYet their love remained strong,\nThrough the trials and the pain,\nFor they knew their love was true,\nAnd it would never wane.\n\nSo let us raise a toast to love,\nThat shines like a star in the night,\nA love that will conquer all,\nAnd fill our hearts with light. \n\nFor in this world of chaos and strife,\nOne thing remains forever clear,\nThat love is the most powerful force,\nAnd it conquers all fear.",

    "In the hush of night, as snowflakes fall,\nAnd blankets the world in a shroud so small.\nThe earth lies still, and all is calm,\nAs nature slumbers in her icy balm.\n\nThe trees stand tall, their branches bare and grey,\nSilent sentinels throughout the day.\nA winter wonderland, a landscape painted white,\nUnderneath the moon's soft silver light.\n\nFrost clings to leaves and rooftops high,\nCreating a world that's cold and slicked with ice.\nYet there's beauty here, in this frozen land,\nPeaceful and tranquil, just like grains of sand.\n\nSo let us rest, amidst this chill so deep,\nAnd listen to the silence while we sleep.\nFor in this pause, we find moments rare,\nTo slow down and cherish life's breathable air.",

    "The ocean, that mighty ocean,\n\nIn all it's eternal motion,\n\nDoes speak in every wave,\n\nAnd tell us there's nothin' we can do to alter our condition.\n\nThe ocean of life rolls on and on,\n\nNo matter how high or how low;\n\nSo many fish swim in it,\n\nThey're not worth a cent, 'cause they keep getting thrown back.\n\nOh, this old, mighty ocean,\n\nHow big and wide it seems to me,\n\nIf ever I were given the power to control it,\n\nI would never have one second's peace,\n\nFor every day the mighty ocean,\n\nLike a roiling, raging, angry beast,\n\nWould rise and grow, grow and rise,\n\nAnd I know it would give no rest\n\nUntil it had completely swept me away...\n\n## **Eternal Life**\n\nOne of the reasons many of us have trouble with the concept of eternal life is not because we think, I can't imagine living forever. That's the least of our problems. The reason we get into trouble is, _I can't imagine the Lord ever loving me enough to want to keep me for eternity_.\n\nWhat a terrible conclusion that is! We may love the Lord as our Savior, but we can't think that he would love us enough to offer us a life after death. But even that is not the worst of it.\n\nIn the first chapter we looked at a statement that was made by Jesus: \"I am come that ye might have life, and that ye might have it more abundantly\" (John 10:10). Think again on what this really means.\n\nTo you who never quite caught on to the Lord's plan, we want to say, _Think_! If we really wanted you to have a wonderful, abundant spiritual life here and now, wouldn't it have been logical to have made a plan in which you could have the abundance of spiritual life _without_ ever having to be resurrected to life? But if you think that thought through, you realize something: You don't have anything here and now that's worth being resurrected to! There is nothing in your life that is good enough, that you and God can be proud of, or that has the kind of value that a",

    "The Frog Prince\n\nOnce upon a time there was a king who had three daughters. The two elder daughters were very beautiful, but the youngest was so ugly that no one could bear to look at her.\n\nOne day the king said to his daughters, \"My dear children, I am very ill, and I am afraid I shall not live long. Now I want you to promise me that you will be kind to each other, and that you will always remain good and true.\"\n\nThe two elder daughters promised, but the youngest said, \"I will promise nothing, for I am sure you will die and leave me all alone in the world.\"\n\nThe king was very angry, and said, \"If you will not promise, you shall have nothing when I die.\"\n\nThe king died, and the two elder daughters were married to two rich princes. But the youngest daughter had to go out into the world to earn her living.\n\nOne day she was sitting by the side of a well, crying bitterly, when a frog came up to her and said, \"Why are you crying?\"\n\n\"Because I am so ugly,\" said the princess.\n\n\"If you will let me sit in the sun on your hand, I will promise to turn into a handsome prince,\" said the frog.\n\nThe princess was very much surprised, but she took the frog in her hand and let him sit in the sun.\n\nThe frog sat there for a long time, and at last he said, \"I am now a handsome prince, and I will take you to my father's palace.\"\n\nSo the princess went with the frog, and they rode for a long time through a dark forest. At last they came to a great palace, and the frog said, \"This is my father's palace. I must go in first, and then you must follow me.\"\n\nThe princess waited outside the palace, and after a long time the frog came out and said, \"My father will not let you in, because you are so ugly. But if you will promise to sit outside the door and not to speak to anyone, I will go in again and ask him.\"\n\nThe princess promised, and the frog went in again. After a long time he came out and said, \"My father will let you in, but you must promise not",
    "I am back in Udaipur once again, this time with my love - to live for few moments like I have lived earlier and forget everything else... but as we all know things do not come exactly similar so here also she was missing somewhere.. just because her brother stayed at Panchkula… But what can be more beautiful than watching twinkling stars over your head alongwith those little lightening flashes! We are alone together under canopy; on our right side there stands grand Lake Palace Hotel surrounded by water body looking amazing especially during night while lake front looks gorgeous even if you look after early morning. A view that makes us spell bound every-time :), specially when enjoyed riding through road (on some rented bike) next day ; feeling freshness mixed up very well..! After coming down,we visited nearby market then left driving towards Ambabari Road's new entry lane which has become centre now … On one hand where people were doing business inside shops or enjoying variety foods outside other restaurants – many couples would pass behind them arm holding tight each others making me feel how life moves!! No doubt couple need their private moment…. How these places still remain cool? Even though no rain comes frequently yet they survive somehow maintaining good climate due its lakes surrounding it keeping air clear thus providing comfort weather conditions unlike place called Chittorgar fort lying near Jodpur area famous worldwilds who get dried almost anytime despite being rich city having big forts around town…… Infact overall region seems totally different offering breathtaking views however u might find such type elsewhere only….. Anyway moving onward let return same way passing across lanes crowded either markets stalls/stalls hotels...etc., till end exit gate known 'Kishanpole' meaning Lord Krishna pole built within boundary giving nice sight seeing opportunity..... And why don't i talk about best mithai shop located closeby serving delicious tastes using kaju pure ingredients prepared & sold out straightaway immediately!! Yipe(i've tried both types dry cakes n wet milk sweets). They always appear perfect mixture two worlds old traditional living beside modern advancements.... Everything got merged properly although never compromised integrity part intact.... At times thought may lack enough power balance future goals desired therefore needs adjustment according latest trend happening among youths bringing lot revolution changes into lifestyle...... Such whole scenario gives positive impression rather bad image created usually against Indian society showing wrong impressions thru media channels mostly news papers tv programs movies etc",
    "It's been said that the river of life flows swiftly and we have no choice but to jump in. For this there are many who believe life is a game and this is true no matter what the age. Life is a game but a very serious one and if it can not all be understood why should it then be taken lightly. Not all games are created equal, not all life's are also. And there are so many people all over the world in different ways are faced with the truth that life has no choice but always and forever to go on. And this truth does not make it either good or bad just as truth itself in the world has made itself neither. But there are also the many people that do not choose to jump and for this there is this also truth that does not make the difference either good or bad. Because there is this truth also that each person has a responsibility to not leave what is most valuable in the world behind for another to be the keeper of whatever is so valuable. Life is a game and a very serious one no matter what the age at the same time it is the same as the truth that life has no choice but always and forever to go on.

    "Onward we went through the woodlands cool,\n\nThe air was deliciously cool;\n\n'Twas a pleasant wood, a pleasing wood  \nWhere nature wore her beautifulest smile;  \nThe birds were singing, the squirrels playing,  \nThe cedar-trees were fragrant and gay! \nTo the reader:\n\nThis poem represents only one writer's idea about the wooded nature in his own specific area. He lives in the American Southeast, not in the Pacific Northwest, where I do. And his view is not only his own—he is sharing in that of a much earlier day. As you know, naturalists are interested in understanding the natural world and their own place in it. And those who are interested also in the natural world in its past condition and in its potential future condition are naturalists of another stripe, though some would argue that this type of person might have other terms more suitable to describe their focus.\n\nThis poem was written in the nineteenth century by a man who was trained in the science of botany, zoology, and entomology before and after the Civil War. As a result, he describes the life of the forest accurately in a way that perhaps I never would. I am from the twenty-first century and have a different way of looking at things than he does. How would you describe a forest? What do you see there now? What would you like to see in the future? How should you interact with the nature that you see?\n\nWe all have our own relationship with nature and its past, present, and future. What is your view? What do you love about it? What do you think should happen to it? How does it affect, or affect you? This book is an invitation to look at nature in the past, present, and future and your relationship to that nature. It is also an invitation to write your own poems and stories.\n\nThe following list is a short menu of information that can help get you started.\n\n**Naturalists View of the Past:**  \n **1.

It is a list of \"the closest ones.\" It reads in part:\n\nYou know you can tell me, I will help you, but you have to be truthful, be honest—no point in lies as I know all you do anyways; remember that—trust me, I will be loyal.\n\nThis poem, combined with the song lyrics, make it clear that Aisha trusted him and \"believed in\" him.\n\nWhen police interviewed Aisha, she gave them information about her boyfriend and the relationship. Specifically, she told them about the time she was locked up. She also told them about an incident involving a box, another time she took the rap for her boyfriend because of his violence and drug use, and their respective roles in their drug-use activities.\n\nAisha provided details about the time that she was locked up and she described her boyfriend saying that he would \"help her get out.\" Her description of what happened to her upon her release was consistent with the report of the man who found Aisha.\n\nAisha provided information to police about an incident when, according to her boyfriend, the box was dropped in a trash can. She stated that she saw he was on probation (which he later indicated to investigators that he was) but because of her boyfriend's threat she was not allowed to turn him in.

    "Father Gillinan, he was an Irishman; He came to this country when quite young and small And in his native land they called him Paddy O'Gilligans But here we call them father or Monsignor Gilgannon The first time I saw that man it made me feel so proud To see how well dressed up our priest looked on parade In all my life before never had seen such fine attire As worn by good old Padre Patrick Jolly-O! His coat with gold buttons shone like silver bright With epaulets upon each shoulder white as snow Then down below there were two rows o'sparkling brass That glittered just above where you could not miss 'em at night When out for some fun after dark without any light Oh what would have happened if one day while walking along We'd met those soldiers who wore red coats instead? They might've thought us rebels because their uniforms Were very similar excepting only color blue Instead did meet another kind which proved most true For these men belonged right then within company B Which meant no harm but rather helped protect Our lives against danger coming near enough So long may God bless both sides alike forevermore Amen!\"",

    "> Dear Future Husband,\n\n> I'd be forever grateful if you'd stop me as I'm mid-way through an awkward move in public—the kind where I'm trying to get a bag off my head while also using my elbow to block the view of my fanny, while at the same time pretending I'm looking for my lost contact lens. But most importantly, if we have kids, don't let them see me in this position, ever.\n\n> Thank you.\n\n> Sincerely,\n\n> Insecure Public Dancer\n\nMy reaction after reading the poem: \"Ohmigod. That woman has _my_ life!\" How many times have _we_ found ourselves in embarrassing situations just because we were trying to do the right thing, like holding a purse over our head and hiding \"the goodies,\" I mean, we were trying to make our moves appear more \"ladylike\" in a public place.\n\nI think that this woman hit the nail on the head. I was not a slut by any means, especially in comparison to some of the other girls I went to school with. On my wedding night, he actually told my husband that I was the \"least slutty girl\" he'd ever dated. If you put aside how my husband described me on such an important night, the truth is, it should NOT be a man's job to tell you if you are, or are not, a slut. It shouldn't be anyone's job. It should be your own self—how you feel inside and what you value—that defines whether or not you are a slut. If you're constantly wondering, \"Am I a slut?\" it's probably time to sit down and really think about how much you care about your own self. What kind of values do you have? What kind of a slut are YOU?\n\n# _3_\n\n#\n\n# _Why the \"S\" Word Is OK to Use_\n\nI'm going to get right into it with this chapter. It's time to face our fears. I am not saying that it's OK to have a reputation as a slut in the locker room, at school, at work, with your husband, in the Bible or in the world. But sometimes you have to let go of the need to be labeled as a good girl and stop living up to",

    "\"To live alone, to be self-reliant, to be at peace with all—there is no greater bliss on earth and I say that if there were the chance I could willingly give up heaven and come down to earth to live the rest of my life in an earthly prison. What more can a man ask for, what greater glory, than to be self-reliant?\nWhen a man can no longer live without certain things he must know where to get them, and that's what I mean by self-reliance. You don't just stay on a ship if you see it's going to sink; you save yourself in another way. But self-reliance is not just to save your own self, it's also a way of living. You don't try to blame others, you don't try to depend on others, you rely on yourself.\nWe don't live to be free in America but, in actual fact, we live without freedom, we live in a state of servitude. But there are still enough men who can say \"I live in freedom.\" You see, there are still some who aren't fooled by their own servility! This is why I call you my friend who knows the truth! Because you've found out that without freedom there is no joy in life, nor is joy possible with slavery.\nThe greatest thing we can do for ourselves is to live a truly human life, however insignificant that life may be; to know where the sun rises and where it sets, and to accept the reality that we have to rise each day and work and then each day die; to accept our fate as human beings, neither angels nor beasts, but men; to accept the truth that we are born, we live, and we die. There are few of us who know this simple truth.\nThe meaning of our life is in the living, not in the dying, and if we truly believe it we would live in a way different from our present way of living. We would live our lives more happily and more truthfully; we would live in a spiritual sense, and death would no longer be considered the end!\nThe first step is to understand that this is our destiny.\" ~\nThis entry was posted in Poems in Translation on February 25, 2015 by farrah karapetian.\n\"Won't you come back, come back\"",
    "It does not do to leave things too late – we must always look as fresh and beautiful in spirit when they come into our presence, before which it may be ages ago since your body met its last good-by on Earth.\" The author asks if one can hold that memory true even while being far away for so long? We understand this question because many men cannot forget their wives' appearance after all those months spent apart; however there are also cases where these feelings did fade with time due probably more than just years passing by between them but some deeper change within themselves either through emotional trauma or physical infirmity caused an inevitable dulling down process upon his thoughts related primarily towards her image inside any further future encounterings during life's end game stage called death itself - whether near term (say right now). Or perhaps only closer ones like family members who've never been separated will feel less connected throughout daydreams longer stretches without seeing each other face2face again yet still experience deep love regardless how different lives could veer off course over decades past togethernesses shared up till today! That said though let me ask you readers out here…who might need reminding ourselves about certain people close enough then next week should send emails soon 😁 I know someone special wants help reconnect us back onto same journey traveled separately until recently 🤗💕 And would appreciate knowing my place once reunited finally at home 🙂 Thanks!\"",

    "The Unknown Soldier | by Lawrence Ferlinghetti\nHe has one more cigarette and then\nIt's off to the movies and\nOnto the streets for the\nNewspaper with the scores of the\nFootball games and the\nResults of the balloting\nAnd the political scandals and\nThe stock market and all the rest\nBut this one night he cannot\nGet there. The lights of the\nMovie houses, the juke boxes,\nThe little red dots of the\nBurger places, shine on the\nDark streets and are more\nLively than the bars where the\nOld men sit. But he has one\nMore cigarette then he moves\nTo the door with his small\nTired body and he moves\nOn a pair of worn shoes for the\nThirst and the lights and the\nTired boys and girls of the\nLoud bars and the movie\nScreens that flicker through\nThe streets. He has one\nMore cigarette and he\nHurries down to the\nLonely streets where the red\nDots of the bars shine in the\nStreets.\nThis poem may not have the literary merit of a poem of e. e. cummings, Dylan Thomas, or T. S. Eliot, but it does have merit. The reader is taken on a short journey with the unknown soldier. They encounter him, and in effect, become him, on a cigarette-and-cigar journey into the night, with its loneliness, bars, girls, sports scores, and political scandals.\nThe reader is led to believe that the unknown soldier is just someone like themselves, a regular guy sitting in his apartment waiting for the big game. However, the reader then realizes that this is, in fact, a lonely soldier looking for excitement, wanting a night out. The short lines, which almost have an iambic rhythm, seem to move the soldier along, as well as the reader. Perhaps no one poem can capture what war or the soldier is all about; however, this poem is a strong start.\n\"For what is death/If not to die?\"\n—Romeo and Juliet, Act 3, Scene 1, lines 59-60\nRomeo speaks these words as Romeo, desperate and confused as he always was, has overdosed on poison, leaving the world in a way he",

Is it simply the right\nTo do as one pleases, without any might?\n\nOr is it the ability to choose one's fate,\nTo shape one's destiny, to make it great?\nTo rise above the chains that bind and hold,\nAnd soar on wings of courage, unafraid?\n\nFor freedom is not just an absence of restraints,\nBut the power to create, to innovate,\nTo dream big dreams and strive to attain,\nAnd never give up, no matter the pain.\n\nIt is the courage to stand up for what's right,\nTo fight for justice, to stand tall and bright,\nTo be a beacon of hope in a world of night,\nAnd never compromise what's right and true.\n\nSo let us strive for freedom, not just for ourselves,\nBut for all mankind, for every soul,\nFor in the pursuit of liberty and justice,\nWe shall find our own, and make it whole.",

    "Her skin a petal soft and delicate,\nA blush of rose upon her cheek,\nHer lips a sweet and subtle hue,\nLike dewdrop on a rose's prickly stalk.\n\nThe sway of her hips, a lilting waltz,\nAs she dances through the morning mist,\nHer laughter, a melody that catches,\nThe hearts of those who hear it at its zenith.\n\nWith hair as dark as midnight's veil,\nAnd eyes that sparkle like the stars above,\nShe glides through life with confident grace,\nA kaleidoscope of color, love, and care.\n\nHer very presence lightens every room,\nAnd those who know her, hold her dear,\nFor in her heart, there beats a flame,\nA love that burns for all to share.\n\nMajestic queen of colors rose,\nA true coleur de rose, you'll always be,\nForever beautiful, inside and out,\nA shining beacon in a world of gray.",
    "As I walk through fields so green,  \nI ponder on life's fleeting scene;   \nFor soon these leaves will turn to yellow    \nAnd autumn shall take its toll.  \nThe wind whispers secrets in my ear     \nOf change and growth as it blows by,      \nReminding me that nothing stays forever       \nIn this world where we all must die.  \nBut even though time marches forward        \nWith no regard for our mortal plight,         We can find solace in nature’s beauty          That remains constant throughout the night.  \nSo let us embrace each season            \nWith gratitude for what it brings:           Spring with flowers blooming anew,             Summer sun shining bright blue skies,              Autumn hues painting trees gold,                 Winter snowflakes falling soft and pure.  \nFor within each moment lies               A lesson waiting patiently                To teach us about resilience                  And how to rise above any fray.",
    "In ancient tales, there lies a serpent known  \nAs The Love Serpent - wielder of great power and charm;   \nWith eyes like stars that twinkle in the night,  \nAnd scales as bright as jewels shining so right. \n\nThis mythical beast roams forests deep and wide, \nEnchanting all who cross its path with grace divine. \nFrom humble peasants to kings on thrones aloft,    \nAll are ensnared by love's sweet song it sings without pause or thought:\n \n\"Come hither,\" whispers softest voice you'll ever hear ;     \n\n...",
    "The world has lost the ear for rhyme,\nWhere once sweet poetry did thrive.\nNow only echoes fill the air,\nOf what was once a beautiful art.\n\nIn times long past, the poets sang,\nTheir words a symphony of sound.\nThey wove a tapestry of dreams,\nWith threads of gold and silver gleams.\n\nBut now the world has grown so cold,\nThat even love can't keep us warm.\nAnd where there was once passion's fire,\nNow lies a frozen, barren form.\n\nThe art of rhyme has lost its way,\nIts beauty faded into grey.\nAnd though we search for answers,\nWe find no way to make it stay.\n\nFor in a world of haste and haste,\nThere's no time for such frivolous things as verse.\nAnd so the world has lost the ear for rhyme,\nA tragedy of epic proportions, if ever there was one.",
    "Concrete jungle where dreams are made,\nA city of steel, glass and shade,\nWhere millions flock with hopes and fears,\nA place where fate sometimes collides.\n\nThe streets are alive with pulsing lights,\nA symphony of honks and sirens' cries,\nA rhythm that beats through the night,\nA dance of life that never dies.\n\nSkyscrapers reach for the heavens above,\nReflections shimmer like a lover's stave,\nA canvas of dreams painted by the dove,\nAn urban tapestry of love and stave.\n\nBeneath the concrete and asphalt roads,\nA heartbeat thrums with wild abode,\nA living, breathing entity that grows,\nA city with a soul that will not slow.\n\nIn the alleys and on the sidewalks,\nStories unfold with every stride,\nSecrets whispered in the midnight hours,\nLost dreams and hopes that still reside.\n\nYet in this city of endless motion,\nThere's beauty in the grit and grime,\nA spark of hope that shines like a vision,\nA glimmer of light in the darkest time.\n\nSo let us embrace this City Visions,\nWith open hearts and minds and eyes,\nFor within its streets and alleys wide,\nOur dreams and destinies lie in disguise.",
    "Who am I? This question echoes in my mind\nAs I search for the answer, it slips beneath my grind\nIs it my name, my occupation, or something more?\nMy actions, my beliefs, my very core\n\nI look in the mirror, but the reflection is vague\nThe image of me shakes as I try to rearrange\nThe pieces of my identity that I can't embrace\nThe memories and dreams that are shrouded in a haze\n\nIt's not what I wear or where I roam\nIt's not the color of my skin or who I choose to love\nIt's the flame that burns deep inside my chest\nAnd the voice inside my head that whispers \"You're the best\"\n\nIt's the lessons I've learned and the tears I've cried\nThe laughter and joy that have filled my head\nIt's the hope that keeps me standing tall\nAnd the love that I share with everyone\n\nSo, who am I? A question no longer asked\nFor I know the answer, it's embedded on my wrist\nWith every breath that I take and every step I make\nMy identity stands strong, now I can only shake\n\nThe fear and doubt that once clouded my mind\nRevealing the truth that I'm proud to find\nIn this journey called life, I will never be blind\nFor I am who I am, and that's a wonderful thing.",
    "Once upon a time, I thought my car was all that mattered,  I'd wash it every week and keep it shining bright.  But now as years have passed me by,   I realize just how foolish I must look in everyone's eye. \n\nFor cars are nothing more than metal shells we fill with our pride,    They break down when they're old or no longer needed beside.

    "Her tresses flow like a golden river,\nGently caressing her slender shoulders,\nAs she walks with grace and poise everlasting,\nA vision of loveliness undiminished.\n\nIn the breeze her hair dances and waves,\nAs if inviting me to join the revel,\nBut I stand still, entranced by her charms,\nCaptivated by the girl with the long blonde hair.\n\nHer eyes sparkle like a summer sky,\nFilled with stardust and endless delights,\nAnd her smile, oh her smile, is a ray of sunshine,\nWarming my heart and lighting up the night.\n\nBut alas, I am but a mere spectator,\nBound by the chains of my own making,\nForced to watch from afar as she passes by,\nThe girl with the long blonde hair, my making.\n\nYet still, my dreams are filled with her presence,\nHer image etched on my very soul,\nA reminder that true beauty transcends bounds,\nAnd that love knows no bounds, no fool.",
