    "Didn’t see this posted anywhere so sorry if this is a repeat. The recent 1.2 patch made it so you can make the “key item” icon on Johnny’s gear disappear by collecting all of his stuff and getting the Breathtaking achievement. Thing is if you decide to upgrade his gear from rare to epic then the epic version will have the “key item” icon and you won’t be able to get rid of them. Same thing if you upgrade the epic version to legendary. What you need to do is upgrade the rare version into epic then epic version into legendary before you get his pistol. Once you get the pistol all three versions in your inventory will have the “key item” icon removed from them. Then you’ll be able to delete them or store them in your stash or do whatever you want with them.",
    "Hi I am new to the app so I need some advice. I purchased from a seller, please keep in mind they have 70 reviews all 5 stars. I ordered on March 27 and they marked the item as shipped in the middle of the night like 4 am there time , anyways it’s been a whole week the item hasn’t even been picked up according to tracking, just says USPS Is waiting for item. I want to give the benefit of doubt to them Bc they have all 5 stars but at the same time all other sellers I’ve bought from who shipped the same day I’ve gotten packages from already. The seller contacted me and said they noticed my package hasn’t moved should They cancel mercari I told them yes , never gave me an update. Since it’s been a week so I am eligible for cancel. Should I cancel or just keep waiting? This has never happened to me once on the app. Also if I do cancel since it’s been over a week does the seller have to approve?",
    "This is my first post here. I am a first time teacher coming out of college and currently applying for jobs while student teaching. I thought I did really well at this last interview and there were a lot of good signs coming out of it but they called me today and it was a rejection. I am starting to feel really discouraged in the job hunt like I am simply just not good enough and it’s starting to effect my student teaching and really weigh me down. I have been full time student teaching and working 20 hours on the weekends and I am feeling depressed and just so tired. This call today was just another blow. So does anyone have any advice on how to keep my chin up and to continue student teaching while also how to best apply for jobs. Interview advice would be appreciated as well. I just feel really discouraged and would like some positivity.",
    "Ever since I was a kid my mom always taught me to avoid confrontation. Like one time at home depot there was a guy who was in the way and my mom told me to just wait for him to move. Needless to say I just said excuse me. Point being my mom didn’t really expose me much to confrontation so I always avoided it. Now as a 21 year old I have confrontation anxiety. Not as bad as my mom but still there. Today I was waiting in line for chipotle and this guy was mistakenly waiting on the online order line. When he realized he was on the wrong line he went over to my line and went in front of me. I just thought “he waited on that line i’ll let him be.” But now I kind of think I should’ve said something and it keeps running in my mind. Anyways, how do I be more confrontational about situations and stop being a pushover for small things?",
    "I ordered the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G 512 GB in color Phantom Black originally back on March 2, 2021 from AT&amp;T. I finally received it on April 8 2021. I waited a very long time to get this particular model and I only found out about a delay because of chip shortages from Reddit. First of all to even remove the expandable memory slot and then have customers have to wait a lengthy amount of time for their order because they choose the 512GB version is insane. My cellphone carrier kept saying it was coming... it will be there in a couple of days etc. for the entire time. I told myself once I get it I will post it on Reddit  just so maybe I can end some frustration for anyone else waiting for their order.  The one good thing that I can say however is that I love this phone. It did not disappoint. I had used the Samsung Galaxy Note phones for at least 6 or 7 years. It was hard to get me away from the Note versions, had my Samsung Note 9 for the a little over 2 years. I had a lot of wear and tear on my phone so I did a lot if research to narrow down my next cellphone purchase choice. I am so glad I decided to get a different version this time. Samsung cellphones are my go to brand and will continue to be in the future. The Samsung Galaxy Ultra 5G phone is a definite winner. So many pros and a few cons but the features and specs are remarkable so I will no doubt recommend this brand to anyone who wants to purchase a new cellphone in the near future.",
    "I was talking with my therapist today about all of the judgements my JNMIL has about me.  We talked about how a lot of these judgements are at odds with one another and don’t make sense.   For example, following my DD’s birth she complained that I contribute nothing to my marriage or our finances, despite the fact that DH and I both work successful high paying jobs where I frequently earn more than him.   Then when i returned to work, she accused me of not caring about my DD’s wellbeing and being an awful mom. Despite knowing that these ideas literally don’t make sense when taken together, I still can’t help but let her get in my head.  My therapist asked why I thought that was and truly I can’t answer.  I’m curious, why do your MILs words/judgements bring you down?",
    "I was just thinking that it's really weird that Goku never really teaches anyone his techniques other than the kamehameha but what if he decided to start teaching others the Kaioken including Vegeta. Would Vegeta's SSJBE + Kaioken x20 be more powerful than Ultra Instinct Goku. I get the impression that it would be but I have only watched the show and not the manga so I'm not sure how different the manga is. I think Piccolo and Tien would also greatly benefit from Kaioken as they have some of the most powerful kai blasts in all of Dragon ball relative to their power levels. I feel like Tien in the cell Saga using Kaioken x20 with his Neo Tri Beam would do some major damage to Semi perfect cell and Piccolo with Kaioken x20 would probably kill him.",
    "Idk if it's just me but everytime I see some fucking shithead just being an absolute cunt and making entire hate pages, shitting on his ig lives and just harassing the dude in general it makes me lowkey sad af. Some cunt just leaked a bunch of this dudes personal information and luckily I think it all got deleted but I know how shitty it must be to have that happen to you and I know I wasn't supposed to see that. You cant let the haters get to you at the end of the day which I think Sem has a bit of a problem with cuz every time he reacts to something he just adds fuel to the fire but I cant imagine having people constantly make fun of you and just hate you for doing what you like is an easy thing to swallow especially since he is still an underground artist.",
    "i have a friend that i have been friends with for a few years. i love him a lot, we have been through a lot together. but i feel uncomfortable around him. he is so fixated on body image of other people and is constantly look-driven. i know he is trying to fix it, but i have an ED and am already very conscious about myself and knowing that he is always looking at people, fixating on their skinniness and comparing people makes me very uncomfortable when i have to hang out with him. i have no problem dressing however i want with my other bestfriend, but when im with him i feel like i need to cover everything up and make sure he never looks at my body because i know he thinks about it. i have been rethinking our friendship because it’s getting really bad and we stopped being friends because of comments he constantly made on me before. he said he is trying to change but he still says things and i feel like everytime i move forward with my ED i take 10 steps back when i see him. please give me some advice",

    "Hi all. So I received an FX-8350 as a gift and I made an OK build with it. Though I made the absolute stupid mistake of using m5a78lm-usb 3 motherboard from ASUS which have horrible VRMS and therefore when using the 8350 with this motherboard, it throttles the performance as soon as it hits 60° or above 50% usage. I decided that I will save up to buy the Asus M5A97 EVO R2.0... should I buy a different motherboard coz I don't want to make the same mistake. Also, cause the 8350 is basically a room heater, I decided that I might spend extra on the thermal grizzly conductonaut. But then the product page says not to use this paste with aluminium heatsink. Does anyone know if the 8350 has an aluminium heatsink?. Thanks.",
    "It's been quite a while since I've posted anything on reddit when my life started to crumble I just lost interest in everything. Thanks to covid I lost my job and as if murphy's law needed proving my partner of 5 years left me for someone she met at her job . No I barely get to see my 5 year old daughter instead of bed time stories it's inconsistent visits for a hour or two when it's convenient for  my ex. I'm currently living in a friends couche . My thoughts keep me up all night so I end up sleeping late I'm no doctor but the depression life is absolutely real. I know I'm not the only person to go through this and I feel far from special . I guess the purpose of this post is to maybe find a friend or someone I can talk to , not even about serious stuff just anything in general . I feel I'm seriously lacking a connection with someone from the outside world. I got desperate to try omegal none of the guys want to talk just show pictures of their junk and the girls  well I don't probably so used to scummy people they either say high or try and be rude and bounce.  I don't care who you are where you're from or what your going through or into I believe I can find common ground with anyone as long as we try and be kind to each other, we all deal with life drama don't me? If anyone reads this and feels the same or just has some extra time and wouldn't mind messaging I'd love to hear from you. Im deeply sorry about the wall of text rant I just had to get some feelings off my chest. Anyway good night guys thanks for listening.",
    "I haven't had physical touch from another person in a long time. I live with 3 roommates and they all avoid me. I have no friends, no family, nobody is interested in me. I feel like I'm losing it. I already have a schizoeffective disorder and it makes it hard to socialize so having the people I want most in my life want nothing to do with me is painful. I just want someone to hug me...hold my hand, something to let me know that I'm not some kind of disgusting freak. I feel so gross all the time because nobody wants to touch me so it must be something wrong with me. Idk what to do....I've been seriously considering paying for a date. Not sex but a date. Just buying someone's company for the night, but even then I'm too broke to afford it. What can I do??",
    "The last time I tried to do this, my mom just said that “drugs won’t fix anything” and just kinda left it at that, but now things are a lot worse and I want to try again because I’m really not in a good place mentally rn. My parents are the type to think that essential oils and natural remedies work for everything, and they’re super strict on phone usage and certain apps and stuff, which doesn’t help with the anxiety at all. I wrote out a note to give to my mom talking about all this stuff and how I’m almost positive I have severe anxiety and depression but I’m not sure if I should actually give it to her. I don’t normally feel comfortable talking to my parents about serious things like this, or even anything at all, but I’m hanging onto the little shred of hope that I might actually be able to get help and possibly some meds to help with stuff. There’s also the possibility that they won’t react well at all and might make stricter phone rules and stuff like that and the thought of it going badly is holding me back. I really need to know if it’s a good idea or not to give the note to my mom, because I want help with all this but I really don’t want it to backfire on me",

    "So I’m an apprentice tech. diesel. I’ve always liked turning wrenches but lately im wondering if I should of just let it be a hobby. I think the icing on the cake was this project a decided to take on. Putting in a new sound system . I’ve done multiple before but this time it’s on a car that was apparently designed by a bunch of engineers with there head up there ass and every little thing is a headache. It kinda made me realize, do I really wanna be getting angry every day at shit like this? Hurting myself all the time even if it’s just little stuff, and not to mention it feels like I just generally wasn’t meant to be a mechanic. I’m always doing stupid shit in the shop. Fucking up day in and day out. Ik I’m new and have a lot to learn but it seems like the other techs are giving me wayy more shit on a daily basis and it’s usually my fault. This apprenticeship wasn’t a sign on so I can leave any time but it doesn’t help that I’ve already spent thousands on the trucks. What would you do in my shoes? Do you ever regret taking this career path. Ik this question isn’t necessarily mechanically related but this is the only active mechanic sub I could find. Any words of advice would help me right now.",
    "I was cleaning out my dad's apartment he recently passed from COVID-19 and as I was cleaning out the drawers and cabinets he filed his paperwork. He passed away a NW7 a tiny fringe of hair on the sides behind his ears and the back of neck MPB destroyed all of his follicles decades ago. He died at 83 years oldAll I saw were pamphlets and envelopes for more information pertaining to Bosley Hair Club for men. A lot of them and yet he never acted on them over the years. And I could tell that while he was here his bald appearance really bothered  him front the amount of all of the Bosley stuff I found which was extensive. What it told me was DO anything you have to while you are here to feel better about YOURSELF. You don't owe or have justify why you are doing it to anyone. This is about your self esteem and confidence not about THEM. Because life is short and it goes by in an eyeblink. So all of the medications..the transplants or whatever you are doing to maintain or increase hair growth is an investment in your own fulfillment of happiness. Period.",
    "Battlefield in all honesty is a pretty easy mode now. F2P cards are extremely viable in this mode and with all the General Pool EZAs we have now it seems like it would be a cake walk. For the first round LS Boosts from a total of 100- 120 are usually more than enough, the 2nd round is super doable with 200% or below, and We already save up the best LS boosts and units for the 3rd round fights. Battlefield is usually the mode where the units I've built but don't use as much get there use. It would be as easy increasing the character limit from 112 to 140, and it would be a fix to get more Battlefield memory for the new LRs and TURs that will be added, plus more dragon stones. Also the weekly rerun of 6k memory can finally be boosted.",
    "I'm ~32wks, I have not been feeling great today and not sleeping well. This morning my partner brought me flowers for no reason other than to be affectionate. Almost made me cry because I've been feeling so rough and it was so thoughtful. We've been trying to figure out how to make our last names work, how to decide what to do because we're both attached to our names &amp; know we want to eventually share a name but it's a rough hybrid combo. Tonight I was not feeling well so he was comforting me and in a lovely and intimate way he told me that he'd take my name when we get married. Not sure that will be the ultimate outcome, but it's heartwarming to know that he's willing to sacrifice things that are important to him just to make me happy and bring us closer together. So sweet. I am so fortunate.",
    "Hello I've just started rocksmith and I start by playing a song and it's a bit easy at first, only one or two notes. After I get my score I re-do it and it I just have no idea what I'm doing. I cant move my fingers fast enough to hit all of the notes. I still havent really memorized which string is where so I accidentally strum the wrong one. I have to look at the fretboard for finger placement because anything past 5 gets me confused. I just feel really unmotivated right now. I'm doing the lessons and the ones I couldn't complete were tremolo 101 and palm muting because it was just too fast. I can get it slower but when it goes full speed it just falls apart.

    "So before 4 days ago, I had gone without twitter for 10 days. I had a huge urge to download the app again at that point and I had made up the excuse in my head that I was able to moderate my usage now. I came back to the app and had gotten lots of love from the people I’ve met on the app and how much they’ve missed me which made me want to stay even more.  I also only came back on a private account, not my main account, as I thought it’d limit my usage much more but it turns out I’m still incredibly addicted to the app because of the group chats. I realized I had the urge to use the app more than to do my own school work and even something as simple as watching anime plus the fact that i had gained anxiety back from scrolling through social media so much. I immediately deactivated my account again, said my goodbyes and deleted the app and I have just now completed day 2. Although it absolutely sucks that I have to restart again, it feels easier this time around for some reason. It was a little bit harder the first 10 day break I had but now it seems way easier, which gives me a lot of optimism for the future. I will 100% stick with my promise to not come back to that app until I have at least finished everything for the last school semester. Even then, I’ll still try to see if the app interferes with stuff such as skateboarding and other hobbies. I learned a lot from this.",
    "Be careful and aware if you use PokeMod, as a local who's moving found out that someone posted that used PokeMod, has just been caught for using it. Using any type of enhancements such as PokeMod for Android can be just as risky in my opinion, as using a modded client can be. Of course I've been expecting it to happen. The modification apparently however can only be used by those who are rooted. However if you wish to use PokeMod do so at your own risk, and don't use with your main account, or accounts that you care about. However PokeMod while not advised will be permitted to be asked about, and allowed to be mentioned as an option. But also if you do recommend it, also include a warning it can be detected as a modification, that's injected into the game and original client. I have a feeling there will be more people who uses it, reporting that they've received a ban/warning/strike, in the coming days and weeks.",
    "This is a genuine question, I apologize if this comes off as the asshole style of trolling \"jUsT aSKiNg a qUeStIon.\" In a fully cooperative corporation workers and only workers own the means of production, but the government's role is more related to regulating them, but the corporations still remain in a free market. To me, this seems like one of the more ideal ways to prevent government corruption from stifling innovation, while protecting workers' rights and value-added, as any profits, they would be entitled to the full share of in a democratized workplace. I've heard they can be compatible with socialism, but it can be hard to find a clear answer. Was wondering if I was missing something or there is something I am not considering.",
    "I'm a victim of some serious cyber bullying, stalking and harassment. I was exposed online by a group of trolls last year who made my life a living nightmare. They hacked me and traced my ip address and then found my physical address. They then posted my real name, my address, my social security numbers, my parents name, my parents social security number, and posted our phone numbers online for the whole world to see. This is all part of a forum that I was part of and they exposed me to everyone on that forum. They then used my phone number in a spoofing device and called in a bomb threat and made my number appear on the caller ID. I was arrested and charged with making a bomb threat. My friends then found out and some of my friends just ditched me and one of my friend and his parents are afraid of me now. These people have ruined my life and I am living in a night mare. I just want to kill myself by shooting myself in the head. How can I cope with all of this stuff that they did to me ???",
    "We have an old oil hydronic boiler that is on it way out. We are buying a solar system soon and would like to be able to use the electricity to power the boiler if possible. I will be getting a battery backup and am able to get credits with our utility company for the winter months. I do understand that a spilt system with heat pump is best for going with electric heat but doesn't do well below 40 degrees, give or take. There are some amazing incentives in NY for geo-thermal but that might be out of my price range. Another option I came across is pellet boilers. I currently have a 185,000 btu oil boiler but I think it's oversized. My house is 2,000 sq feet. From some research I see that 50 x sq foot is a good rough estimate.

They think it will end with happy end but no. Seriously, if Eren did 100% genocide may look evil but as the 80% is not lol, the Eldian is free from world hatred, future generation can be free, no longer war, not longer burden kids with parent responsibility, Historia can be full time housewife taking care her kid. But the opposite happen, with 20% survivor, do you think they will accept peace by only talking, is talk no jutsu work in this cases. No, they will demand something to pay 80% lost life. And certainly Paradis will engage in war. The cycle of hatred still continue, future generation can't be free, they will be demand to fight in war. Also Historia child will inherit her mother burden as she's princess to Paradis to lead the army after her mother die. Nothing is FREE.

    "Fast food has some kind of backroom deal with the pickle industry. Notice the hamburger pickle chips sold at the store are far thicker than the pickles on fast food burgers? They are also packed in a weaker brine, so the thick consumer chips require much higher brine content to maintain the pickle flavor. So while fast food gets paper thin, moist but not drenched, just as flavorful pickle slices: consumers are left with thick, sloppy pickle chips. It affects the profile of the burger. How many times has pickle juice washed your toppings off your burger, left your burger too high profile to add the other toppings you wanted, made such a mess with all the juice that anything else on your plate was ruined, or just made it impossible to hold your burger together with a couple of 1/3\" thick sponges slipping around on top drenching everything anytime you tried to grip it? If consumers had access to fast food pickles, they wouldn't rely on the fast food industry for low profile, topping worthy, manageable burgers. How entrenched is this conspiracy? Go to your local deli, buy one of those boars head pickles they have sitting in a jar on the counter, ask the guy to slice it thin with the deli meat slicer. They won't do it. Or go to Sam's Club and try to find fast food style pickles. You won't. All they offer is the thick consumer quality ones you can get at the grocery store. Even though their target customer is small business owners, they know regular consumers shop there too, and they won't risk any of us having access to fast food thin sliced pickles.",
    "So, I find a lot of the parts of the movie to be really awkward. First of all, the way it was shot is very boring and doesn't reflect the energy of the actual play. It's okay if it's a slower song like The Story of Tonight, or the start of You'll Be Back, but it still doesn't feel like the camera work reflects the actual play. Then, there's the intermission. I understand that it's trying to separate act 1 and act 2, but it's awkward having to wait a whole minute for it to keep going. And the movie was intended for a theatrical release, so it would be awkward to show that in a theatre and people would actually walk out because they think it's a real intermission. Look, I love the actual play itself. I just don't like how it was made for the movie version.",
    "I'm a bit of an introvert but every place I've worked I've always made friends and connected with coworkers. But at my current job, I just don't fit in. I work with a small group of 6 people. One of them is incredibly socially needy. She is constantly is IMing me and will angrily point out if I don't respond to her right away or if I try to give myself some distance. Four of them are not very bright and I don't get their sense of humor and they are argumentative with me when discussing work. My boss--who is a great work mentor and not a micromanager which I absolutely love--is also a bit rude and blunt for my taste. She openly makes comments about how people should just \"get over\" racial injustices because life isn't fair, she has labeled me as a bleeding heart liberal because I speak up when she makes those comments. I know I should just ignore it when people say things I disagree with, but when its bullying comments like that I morally cannot sit back and do nothing.

    "I am about a month into this hobby. I got myself a giant trance x. I walk with a cane do to a hip injury I received from a motorcycle accident when I was younger. Over the last year I have lost 168 lbs and wanted to strengthen my leg muscles before my hip replacement surgery. I told my doc I want you to have to work to get to my hip after I put on all this muscles lol. My legs were so weak. I started riding a beach cruiser about 8 months ago and was able to build up to a 20 mile ride, but I was limited on where I could go because of not having gears. Now I have open up so many doors with this bike. Me and my brother did our first climb two days ago. Holy crap that was one hell of a workout. It is a 14 mile ride with elevation gains of 2200 feet. We were only able to do like four miles with a gain of like 500 feet. The ride down just from that far up the hill got me hooked. This hill now has become my unfinished quest and i will beat it.

    "So I play Dva as my main tank, and recently I've been watching my replays. I noticed that when I'm the only tank, I will take damage till about 450 hp from 600. That's when I DM and start trying to find cover while trying to monitor my team. I learned that as Dva a major point for anyone in competitive, is to use the boosters and back up both mid and back line. I do that while trying to push the payload or advance onto the point. Now I spread myself thing, I take early damage and I try to back up everyone. Am I wrong for doing this? I feel like if I don't take all my teams damage and we lose its my fault. And on top of that I'm usually the only tank because everyone else wants dps. I don't mind what and how others play, as long as they play correctly and not suicide into the fight without support.

    "I think when modeling for games the modifier aspect and the non destructive workflow puts blender above most 3D packages in this regard. One thing that is essential though when working with a high to low poly workflow is keeping the geometry relatively simple and be able to adjust it without having edgeloops around every corner. Maya's crease set tool was very good at that and I wonder why someone has not released an addon for that yet, I would really pay any amount for such tool since it would speed my workflow a lot. Don't tell me that you can do this using vertex groups cause it just doesn't make the cut, is too messy and the values of the crease get lost when you start to have a more complex model. Maybe it is too difficult to create? I would be happy to fund it. Let me know what you think.",
    "So my original plan was to go into grad school after serving. My end date is in July. Unfortunately,  I received a rejection email today and I've been thinking about my options. I really love doing what I do. But I've had a fall out with some people in my office. The stress from them has really been pushing me this service year. I had a moment where I drank every work night. It's gotten better, but I really do not want to serve again as the lead. I'm in an S/N program so my cohort serves in different non-profits which I've heard are super supportive. Would it be possible to serve another year as just an AmeriCorps member? I've already been offered next year's position as the lead but I really just can't. Should I go back into job hunting? Maybe find a job that pays more? I just feel at a lost and upset that my first plan is down the drain. But I am optimistic for another path.",
    "So I work at a bank and we hired someone over a month ago for a full time position. Since this person has been hired she has worked a max of 2 days out of a typical 5 day work week. And she has had a myriad of excuses but the most common is that she is sick and her symptoms are similar to COVID. She has not had a positive test or anything. So HR has basically honored all the time she has had off and she is getting paid for it. Not to mention she gave a customer an extra almost $500 in cash. She still has yet to be really reprimanded by any of the higher ups and is causing moral of the other employees to be really sour. HR at our bank tends to be extremely flexible to new hires in the 90 day probationary period and some have taken complete advantage of it. Definitely makes the older employees feel undervalued because we know if we pulled this we would be fired. I just wonder does anyone have a similar experience and if so what happened to that person?",
    "so basiaclly i heard johnny test is getting a reboot by wildbrain it's coming in 2021 and i hope this reboot be good as the old one if it's not good than my childhood is ruined this is the show i never told anyone because i grew up with it but let me tell you this but dhx and cookie jar entertainment are my favorite television companies because there shows are flashy but it's awesome when they add  action fights but johnny test reboot is going to be on netflix in the usa so my guess that will it be on cartoon network and on disney channel spain they have this show on the family chrgd this show means alot to me i did not know this existed when i was younger for some reason in 2020 johnny test was on cartoon network twice and in 2014 and on TELETOON so this reboot better be good if it's not i'll go mad easily i never talked about this show for years because i keep it personal i would save the old one not the new one i'm still watching you wildbrain entertainment",
    "So, I’m currently trying to teach myself astrology. I find that looking at each thing in my chart helps with understanding parts of it. Like for example, my Mars in Libra is what helps me approach things more calmly and my Mercury in Capricorn helps me to formulate my sentences before saying them. But what I have trouble with is putting everything together. I’ve been reading up on aspects and patterns as well, but I just get so confused. It’s like I have the puzzle pieces but I don’t know how to put them together. So I was wondering how everyone here got the hang of reading charts as a whole instead of just their parts? Does or did anyone else struggle with this on their journey to learning astrology?",
    "So in his Codex entry for 6.3 they’re playing up how mysterious his past is and how nobody really knows where he came from. I think it’s pretty obvious that he’s a Zeltron or maybe a Falleen. I have a few theories as to his past. 1. He was trained by Jadus. Zhorrid is described as Jadus’ “ only known apprentice” so it’s possible he had others and the timing lines up with Rivix being active pre Vector joining the Killiks. Jadus was also willing to use aliens to achieve his goals. Rivix being an agent of Jadus would be a good way to introduce Jadus as the next big bad. 2. He’s a Jedi spy. In the original cut expansion there was going to be a Falleen Sith named Zujen Vale in the Sith Warrior story. Zujen worked for the Emperor’s Hand. Zujen would be revealed as a Jedi and as an agent of Gnost-Dural. They could easily reuse this plot or make him an agent of Sal-Deron. 3. He works for an unknown faction. I feel like this is the most unlikely option but the only reason I’m including it is I wonder if the might use the force user who trained Guss as a new antagonist.",
    "I'm so sorry if I offend anyone by saying this but I am so embarrassed by having fibro. Not because of the condition, but because of the fact that so many people react badly to it and now the new NICE guidelines stating that we shouldn't be offered pain killers for treatment. It took me 10 years to get diagnosed and it's just frustrating that so many people need to comment on how fibro isn't a real illness or people have it much worse.  I just wish I could make people open their eyes and stop treating patients with Fibro like some attention seekers. I'm sick of the patronising looks and the blank stares I get, worst still they've often come from doctors. If Doctors don't believe me then heck who am I meant to get support off. I  don't want sympathy just fair treatment and people to actually care what is best for people with Fibromyalgia, treatment plans that are tailed and offered on the basis of what works for you, and just someone to really help without having to beg and be in tears for 10 damn years wasting my life away suffering endlessly all to be told 'it's in your head'",
    "Went to mow the lawn today for the first time this season and the mower wouldn't start. No problem, I have a backup. That one wouldn't start either. I'll get them repaired when I can find someone to do it, but in the meantime, I can't wait a month to mow. So I went to Home Depot and bought a battery operated lawn mower made by RYOBI. He loved their stuff and I have a ton of their cordless tools here. He would have been jazzed to see the lawn mower. I don't know how many years they have been making them, but I just got tired of dealing with having to buy gas, check oil, whatever else you are supposed to do with a normal gas mower. Plus the new one is just a push button start so it's easier for me. I missing having him get excited about it.",
    "when i was young i used to be hated by every teacher for some reason.. i think it was because i was  quiet kid and they take advantage and abuse their powers as being a teacher.. i remmeber one of my teachers literally called me snnoying in 3rd grade in front of the entire class.. and in 4th grade my teacher used to yell at me but she would be so nice and sweet to “the smart kids” and the teachers pet and in 7th grade my english teacher was the biggest bitch to me she would always yell at me when i would get something wrong and i was always so quiet and never talked . but when the popular or the students she likes does stuff like this she doesn’t care. this is literally the exact reason why i have self esteem issues.. i was so quiet and never participated in class which is why i think they liked to pick on me but it makes me really sad i was so young and i don’t think any kid should be treated like that.. i feel so shitty",
    "I have been looking for RAM for MONTHS. I ordered some back in January and it is still backordered and my attempts to find some elsewhere have turned up empty. My motherboard is a Gigabyte TRX40 Designare. I am looking for ECC unregistered, 128GB of 32GB sticks. I initially ordered  MTA18ASF4G72AZ-3G2B1. ECC unregistered is very hard to find. I initially found some for around $140 a stick but while it has been on backorder the price has gone up $50 and the site doesn't lock in your price. So it will cost me $200 more than planned. I have on occasion found some RAM but only at $200+ a stick. I don't specifically need that model of RAM. I just need it to be DDR4 unregistered ECC and preferably as fast as they offer, since ECC is already going to slow it down. I feel like I've looked everywhere the last few months but I'm hoping someone else might have some ideas.",
    "To cut a long story short, I struggle a lot with my mental health but lately I'm finding that I feel like I need constant validation and attention from other people and I feel very uncomfortable and angry when people ignore me or if I'm not the centre of attention. I feel like a lot of the time people don't appreciate me so I try to get people to notice me by engaging in reckless and impulsive behaviour such as engaging in dangerous activities. I don't know if it's because the whole pandemic is making me feel more alone than usual because I can't go out and socialise but I just feel incredibly disconnected from everyone and social media tends to further exacerbate my feelings of seeking constant approval from other people. A lot of the time I just feel invisible to others or that people just don't give a shit about me. I just feel like people don't care and it frustrates me a lot.",

    "I go to this local taco joint all the time and I always veganize my order and they’re super cool about it and never get it wrong... until today. It wouldn’t have been that big of a deal because I have bad luck ordering fast food but today it just really upset me. I ordered a burrito, you know the standard kind and I told the girl I need to customize it because I’m vegan and I’d like to sub beans and rice for the meat, no cheese or sour cream. She says cool no problem. I get my burrito and I go home. I look and there’s sour cream in it so I go back and this time it’s a guy at the counter so I tell him what’s up and asked if they could remake it for me. He says no problem but the girl who originally took my order starts busting out laughing about it. When he handed me the new burrito I told him that I heard them laughing about me and that I don’t think it’s that funny because I go there on purpose because I love the food and everyone is always super cool about my specialized orders. He apologized and I said thanks for correcting it and I left. Maybe I’m overly sensitive but it hurt my feelings since I had grown to really love that place and I’ve never had anyone literally laugh in my face about my beliefs like that. Who does that? So anyway I just needed to vent and get this off my chest to my fellow vegans who have probably been in my shoes before. Thanks for listening.",
    "He comenzado a ver una serie en Netflix.  Se llama \"¿Quién mató a Sara?\" y me llamó la atención desde la escena inicial.  Se trata de un hombre, Álejandro Guzmán, quien fue injustamente encarcelado por un crimen que no cometió.  Su hermana, Sara, murió en \"accidente\" trágico cuando se cayó de su paracaídas.  Sara fue novia de Rodolfo Lazcano, el hijo mayor de una familia mexicana muy adinerada.  El patriarca de la familia, César Lazcano, convenció a Álex a  asumir la culpabilidad del accidente de Sara para proteger a su hijo, Rodolfo.  A cambio por su sacrificio, César le prometió a Álex  que se encargaría del cuidado de su mamá enferma y que no pasaría mucho tiempo en la carcél.  Pero César mintió y le traicionó.  Al recibir la sentencia en la corte, Álex no recibió la condena fácil que César prometió.  Recibió una condena de treinta años.  Después de pasar dieciocho años en la cárcel, Álex sale temprano por buena conducta.  La serie se enfoca en su búsqueda del verdadero culpable de la muerte de su hermana Sara y su venganza de la familia Lazcano.  Me gusta lo que he visto de los pocos episodios que vi. Hay mucho suspenso y es difícil tratar de adivinar quien es el responsable porque hay muchos sopechosos.",
    "My girl loves how hard I get when I know she’s cheating on me and thinking about other guys when we fuck. She had me believe that a guy was annoying her and she probably wasn’t going to go through with it. Come to find out, she’d been flirting with him the entire next day getting him more ready to fuck her fat pussy by the minute. She loves the thrill of attention and I’m training her more to be everyone else’s slut by supplying her my hard thick dick that only triggers when she’s pretending she’s fucking anybody but me. Her pussy gets immediately wetter when she’s being bad and unfaithful. She started texting him in bet talking about how much she wished it were him. As predicted by dick gets super hard and encourages her to keep going. She even moaned his name for him in a voice message while we fucked. Put us on video for him. She really was just using me only for more pleasure from my slut loving cock and to help her impress the other guy. I’m going to edge while I read their messages back n forth now 🥰 I’ll do updates if this gets upvoted",
    "Me and my brother are graduating together this year and planning to go to the same college, and we both got accepted to Berkeley. Right now we're thinking of either going there or staying in state at the University of Arizona, since we both got a full ride to UA and also college credit from duel enrollment and some extra community college classes, and by the end of this semester I should have about enough to cover freshman year at UA. My brother has been worried about the weeder classes at Berkley since he's planning on majoring in bio and going pre med and it could bring down his gpa a bunch, and he got into the UA honors college which has a specific pre med minor. I'm not sure what I want to do as a career or major, and I was thinking that the extra community college credit could give me some flexibility to figure it out, but since I got into the college of letters and science at Berkeley I would have some time to decide my major before declaring it I think. Would going to Berkeley still be worth it or should we stick to in state?",
    "This is my first post on reddit so bear with me. It was just a normal Sunday night I was stressin out about goin to work that night. I went out back to have a smoke before goin to bed . Then I saw this guy just standin there. I tried sayin get out of my yard but I was so scared the words wouldn't come out. So after about 5 minutes of him starin at me I finally said get out of here or I'm callin the police. He just kept starin so I went back inside to relax. I said to myself maybe I'm just imaginin things. So after about 10 minutes of contemplating whether to go outside or not. I went outside and he was right by my door I froze up my palms were sweatin. He stood there again starin I wanted to go back inside but I was afraid to even move a muscle. He said \"Nice night huh? For killin\". So with every bit of strength I had in me I punched him but it didn't phase him. He pulled out a knife and he said \"Haha you think you're tough huh?\" So he tried stabbin me but i grabbed the knife at the last second. And I stabbed him in the leg to buy me some time and I ran as fast as I could to my car. I got in and drove away. As i was drivin i called the cops and told them everything. I'm currently waitin for them to respond back.",

I’ve always had this feeling of being inferior to my friends and younger family members when it came to smarts, both book and street smarts.

I tried to read more, play mind games, such as chess, study more etc. I genuinely don’t know how to approach this and wanna know if it’s at all possible to get smarter.

    "Went from daily dabber of 5 years to promordal stage. Couldn't eat anything besides oatmeal and plain chicken for a month. Was clean for over 4 months. Have smoked less than 10 times since then now and no issues. The key is obviously moderation. Twice in a week one time maybe. Everyone is different but I would like others to know not everyone is going to just go back to shitsville vomit town after smoking once. Obviously many people who have encountered chs are the same ones who find it so hard to moderate and loved doing it all the time. Chs fucking blows and I was probably one dab away from violently throwing up. I absolutely would hate to experience the stomach pain again. That being said I had to see if I could at least try it again without issue. I did and I am fine. Will I press my luck? No fucking way. Are some of the people here fear mongering? Sure. Is it for good reason? Probably. If you smoke weed one time after months of not using are you gonna go back to square one? Who knows, everyone is different, I didn't. Should you start smoking weed everyday again? Nooooooo.",
    "Straight guy here who like to wear womens leggings and sometimes panties when I'm home and don't have to be anywhere like today because they make me feel sexy. Well I bought my very first lace thong that actually fits my small frame. After I got out the shower and dried off I decided to wear my new leggings and thongs I bought earlier in the week. I also wanted to see how it feel like to me when I see women wearing thongs and wearing tight clothing like leggings and other spandex clothing. So now I've been sitting her in my lace thong and grey gymshark leggings and I can honestly say I'm surprised by how comfortable this clothing combination feels. It's definitely not as uncomfortable as I thought it was going to be. Ladies I'm sorry I judged you and your choice of clothing and how uncomfortable I thought they were. Lol 😜",
    "So I recently broke up with my significant other over a year ago after a 7 year relationship. She was my first gf in all aspects yes even my first kiss. And we went though a lot together, like i stopped her father from rapping her, or her friend from molesting her in our earlier years of our relationship. Hell last year we got an apartment together so we could spend more time together, eventually  i helped her a job at my work, help her buy a car and even got her into the college she wanted to by pulling some strings. Sure we had our fights but we worked them out...or so i had thought. After deciding on what house to buy and possibly names for kids. The next morning she said to me she wanted to break up i was confused and said may i know why ? She just said she wanted to and i said thats a bit vague but she nevergavea reply back to.  We agreed that we should and we did but shortly afterward i came home one night from work and she said she was dating some guy less then 24 hrs of breaking up. I understand once you break up with someone its not cheating  but I felt so much pain that I still don't fully understand. To make matters worse i had lost my job in the same day. Now i am skipping over more painful parts like how she took the rest of my money saying she would go buy groceries and instead spent it all on her new lover. But thats not why im writing this post. In truth I want to know what I still feel depressed over it ? Like why do I still remember her smile or other things ? Which just makes me feel really lonely and i never experienced anything like this before.",
    "I do have tastes, but they seem unimportant and when I mention them to others, I instantly think of myself as ridiculous. I feel I don’t really have anything interesting to say, anything that hasn’t been said before and in better ways. I’ve spent most of my life locked away from other people, so my experiences are not particularly noteworthy. I have an imagination, but I’m not creative, intelligent, knowledgeable nor organized enough to produce anything of substance. I feel I don’t have anything to offer anyone, including myself. I’m completely bored by own dullness. Sometimes I turn to MBTI in order to feel more appealing, but it’s an aesthetic solution that makes me feel even worse afterwards",

But 6 man groups would be way more fun to strategize for and I feel like there are a great many raid teams that are falling asleep every weekend with DSC. I’m talking mostly about enemy difficulty and boss health but also a good way to make the mechanics more difficult without actually making them super complex is just to add more randomness. I hope that master raids do this and don’t just do the same raid but with champions. Yes this does mean that players “lose choice” somewhat but I do believe that this kind of activity is needed in the game for high level players.",

    "Obviously Attila predates our modern understanding of \"conservative\" or \"right wing\" by thousands of years, but I'm still quite confused. As you may recall, last year, Kelly Loeffler ran a campaign ad in which she claimed to be \"more conservative then Attila the Hun.\" This confused me, as I'd never heard anything about Attila being particularly conservative; I also just read a Donald Trump quote from the 2000 election cycle, in which he said, \"I'm on the conservative side, but Buchanan is Attila the Hun.\" Hearing two comparisons of conservatives to Attila the Hun has just left me confused, so I came here to ask anyone who can answer: was Attila the Hun especially conservative? Enough so to warrant these hyperbolic comparisons?",
    "I just finished watching last week's episode and Mike obviously doesn't want to get married but we know they do end up married. Reportedly they aren't together any longer. Can they get an annulment for fraud? She kind of pushed him into marrying her and he very obviously didn't want to but with the 90 day element he felt forced like he had to. I remember Renee Zellwiger and Kenny Chesney got married years ago and then ended up getting an annulment for the reported reason was fraud. There weren't any further details leaked and neither of them ever faced any fraud charges so it can't be too serious of a thing. One of my aunt's many husbands had his first marriage annulled because his wife changed her mind about wanting kids. Same aunt tried to annul another marriage because they didn't consumate the marriage because he had prostate issues. The husband fought it because she knew about his issues before the wedding. That's the sum knowledge of my facts on annulment.",

Instead of making small monster big he would end up turning them, the other trogs, and him small. He was often mocked for this and disrespected by all the other trogs, so was then banished to the sewers for his inability to cast a spell. This made Rage Mage very angry and fill with incredible rage. Rage Mage learned that he could channel this anger in turn it into power, which he then used against his trog bretheren. Other evildoers got word of his power so Rage Mage gathered any army filled with rage and sent it all around Skylands to make sure no one thought he was useless anymore.

    "Yesterday he went off the rails and at one point tackled me onto my back, put a hand on my neck saying he wanted to strangle me to death. I shouted for help as we were outside when he changed his story that he was just trying to hug me, that he loved me and why am I always hurting him. I said that he had said he wanted to strangle me and he said that he hadn't said that. That I was hearing things and going crazy. I spent a sleepless night on the couch not being able to call police or anyone for help as he watched over my every movement.

    "Basically, allowing kids to make this choice right now is running a complex and heterogenous experiment on children, making them guinea pigs. Some people really do \"grow out of it\" after going through puberty or have bi-polar disorder or other psychological issues that leave them confused. Of course the studies linked, which later exposed funding from the companies who make these drugs, have some sketchiness around them as well. 90% of kids who end up on these blockers continue to hormones and are on high risk drugs for life. Its just a fact that being on exogenous hormones, especially androgens, in the long term, increase mortality risk by 2x or more. I'm constantly speaking up about the dangers of hormones in adults, people are pumping themselves full of TRT as they age and getting heart issues/dying young actually. Its just a field full of profiteering, to be honest, and less honesty amongst even clinicians. But the studies, they reveal the facts. And we need more studies on this topic, that's all I'm saying. We shouldn't be risking it in children until we understand the problem better.",

I’ve been using full auto no matter what the range and I consider myself pretty good at the game and it’s not like I’m doing bad either. However when I see other players playing soldier at high level they always burst with it. Would I really be better off tryna learn how to burst people with soldier or just play with what I’m comfortable with.

Checked back a bit later and it had shown up so got my hopes up that issues were over. Not so much.

    "Missing 411 cases fascinate me in part because they really come closest to feeling like the closest real-life analogue to a Cthulhu-esque horror. In the Cthulhu books, these types of beings were portrayed as completely alien and unfathomable, like there is no way to understand their intentions or desires, they are just on another level entirely. They are also irresistibly powerful, mere humans have no hope of overpowering them or defeating them. In Missing 411 cases, we have no idea why this is done to people and what they get out of it, but there is a clear intelligence to which victims are taken, when they are taken, and how they are taken. Also, the entity responsible seems to have no constraints, taking people even from crowded areas and always being able to avoid being witnessed by other people or even security cameras. The implications of this phenomena are utterly terrifying and fascinating.",

It is my understanding that if I do a co-op campaign with say a private party of one other person that I'm going to override any other campaign that I have.? But with the manual saves and the save points is it not possible that I could do a campaign over a course of weeks or months with a friend in the co-op form but also progress on my own or is one going to always erase the other?

    "So I'm amab and for a bit now I've been using fluid. However, I think im just trans and not comfortable with it. A few years ago I was a VERY ignorant middle schooler who had the mindset that you aren't trans, you just need to learn how to be comfortable in your own skin. And I think that and other beliefs I had at the time have repressed and thrown me off. I also can't see myself as female, I refer to myself as a male and don't feel comfortable with calling myself that around others. In a relationship I only ever imagine it as boy/girl or boy/boy, I can't seem to see myself as female. I think my voice also confuses me, because I know I want to do voice training, I just haven't sat down and done it yet. But I love the idea of passing as a woman. Maybe that just enforces the idea that im fluid, but even saying that I'm too scared to \"look like a girl\" im worried that I'll just look like... a dude in a dress.",
    "Last year around June I was heavily invested in stoicism and applied it to my life. I woke up early, meditated, worked out almost twice thought about my morality, was productive and generally had a pretty good outlook on life. I was so obsessed with self improvement and bettering myself each day. I viewed every moment in a stoic manner. Now for the past few months I have been slightly depressed and I have no idea why. I’m in my last year of my high school and have no reason to be depressed because of the hard work I’ve put into school grades and coding projects but I’ve been feeling burnt out and honestly done life. I feel almost trapped in a box and can’t get out. I’m a little lonely and don’t really have any real friends. I decided to separate myself from everybody due to them not being the individuals I wanted to associate myself with. Now all my days really consist of is coding projects , schoolwork and working out. By no means is this a rant but how do I get myself feeling positive again?I wasn’t feeling like this at all last year. How can I get back into stoicism and the practice of it, and regain my motivation and discipline?",
    "For some context, I moved to chicago a few years ago, and my lease expired for my last apartment recently. As such, I decided to move into a new apartment just this week. With my last apartment, I could sometimes hear the neighbors next to me, but could never really hear the ones above or below me. I was surprised to find out I can clearly hear my downstairs neighbor snoring to the point where I might be able to transcribe it in text. This is a hardwood floored apartment and luckily I’m also on the top floor otherwise I fear it may have turned out even noisier than anticipated. Is this something that many of you have also experienced and is normal for apartment life or did I just get a bad draw this time around?",
    "Brief as backstory. My mother is emotionally damaged, severely, not her fault, but resulted in an upbringing where by the age of 9 I was taken to a lot of psychologists to find out “ what was wrong with me”. I left home when I was 14, stayed an aunt until I was 17, moved out and made my own life. Fast forward 13 years, I have a degree, job, house, kids everything I wanted, 2 weeks ago my mum was supposed to be attending a family event but decided not to go, but wanted to come and visit my kids and stay at our house. It’s been 1.5 years since we saw her last so I said yes. She came, was her typical self, this time I felt sorry for her as supposed to getting angry at her for her behaviours - she’ll tell my daughter they’ll go do something then say no she’s too tired. Anyway, since she’s left, I cannot shake the feeling of how I used to feel when I was 14. Things were never good enough, I wasn’t going to go far in life, my achievements aren’t really achievements. Then she texts and asks about only ONE of her grandchildren, typical her behaviour. I’ve talked to my husband about it, I’ve trained hard at the gym gone for extra runs. I’m short with my own kids which isn’t usual for me, I cannot fathom why she is doing the exact same thing she did to me and my brothers now she’s trying to divide my kids, she knew exactly what she was doing, she’s horrible - asked multiple times when my second child’s birthday was. I can’t seem to calm down from this, like I say, I’ve reverted right back to 14 and all those feels associated with that and it sucks.",
    "I am an awesome stepmother to two 20-something “boys”, both with two children of their own. How do we fix their stupid points of view, their stupid decisions, and their shitty relationships? Their father wasn’t much part of their lives growing up, but since I entered the picture we’ve been rebuilding the strained relationships. These two guys just have Kitty point of view about the world, what the world owes to them and how nothing is their fault. We’ve communicated with everyone involved as openly as possible and tried to explain our own personal faults and bad decisions of the past. Our involvement has already helped somewhat, But they need help in ways that we’re just not able to help them, but they are adults and we can’t force them to do anything, whether good or bad. How can we help them?",
    "I've only dated one person and I loved her with my whole being and she said the same to me but then she cheated on me and whenever we fought she made me feel like it was my fault. We tried to make it work but she kept talking to him behind my back and then she started to distance herself from me broke up with me and immediately fucked around with him saying that she didn't love me anymore when a week before she was saying how much I meant to her. Couple months later they stopped being together and we got together again after talking for a while and she said she started to like me again but then suddenly completely stopped talking to me saying she realised she didn't miss me that much and then blocked me everywhere and seems to be with him again. I don't know what I feel, I feel used, unlovable and worthless. I get massive panic and anxiety remembering everything and I've tried to kill myself three times and two times had to be taken to the hospital. She's the only person that's actually made me feel loved. It's like I have no value or reason to be respected.",
    "I’m going to college, I’m a reservist, I played four years of high-school football, got in the newspaper for wrestling, did high school njrotc for four years , and played community college football for two years. My major is physics, but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m a loser. I’m having a hard time in my classes. I’m 22 and still live with parents. I haven’t earned my associates despite having a lot of units completed and being close, I’ve gotten out of shape again, I’m struggling in school, I’ve got a car but no driver’s license. I live in a highly dysfunctional African American family. I mean it feels like I’m supposed to break through but it hasn’t happened yet you know? People are pilots at my age and it doesn’t feel good to be living with mom and 15-35 lbs over weight. I’m not done yet but I’m almost there. Sometimes I feel like I would be accomplishing more if I worked at Walmart or McDonalds. Because society isn’t making practicality out of learning anything meaningful. At some point I’m really going to have to say screw everybody because people don’t really care about me anyway. If the world is going to behave as if it doesn’t owe me anything, then I will do the same. I’ve read 12 rules for life and while I understand I can’t be good at everything, you’d think that I’d have something to call my own. It feels like I’m always halfway to where I need to be. I feel incomplete.",
    "I still hold a bunch of matic, I'm currently staking about 15,000 on two different validators on the maticnetwork ,and have been for a while. But this post is directly about two of the projects on POLYGON that I am excited about. Moonwolf.io is a new coin on the market . New since March 29th of this year. And it couldn't be done without polygon and Quickswap ‼️ 🐺 is a deflationary token, and has auto-staking.1% of every tx gets burned, gone forever. 1% of every tx get distributed to every address holding wolf. With the matic ether bridge, it's easy and cheap to move your coin from the eth mainnet to the maticnetwork. The coin has done amazing things in a short time. And as a REWARD for that the devs are doing an AIRDROP on April 12th . To qualify all you have to do is hold $wolf. Thanks to polygon, I have come to personally come to appreciate the L2 solutions they have come up with and are implementing today. I can't wait to see how this network grows in the future. Thanks for reading. GL and stay strong. If you haven't done so already go stake some coin on the matic network. You won't be sorry when matic stops being so undervalued.",
    "I just watched Seaspiracy, like so many others. Seeing documentaries like these always makes me want to help and have an impact. I’m already vegetarian for several years so reducing or eliminating my seafood intake is not an option anymore. I also use a metal water container instead of plastic water bottles, glass or metal straws and bamboo toothbrushes. I also shop over smile.amazon with Sea Shepherd as my charity, which i’m aware doesn’t do much, but it’s better than nothing. I would like to do more though as we’ve seen that we’re all part of the problem whether we want to be or not. So I was wondering what you guys do to help the planet and how you’re trying to be more sustainable. Often we don’t do anything because we don’t know what to do or where to start, do hopefully we can all give each other some tips and ideas.",

We broke up about 6 years ago. And while she moved on after couple of months Ive not been able to do the same thing even after 6 years. Not a day goes by when I don’t think about her. We haven’t talked since several years and i don’t want to disturb her life now. Every-time I initiate dating someone all i see is her face what would be her reaction on that joke or how would she react. She has a boyfriend now. While I’m still miserable.

    "Covid is a contagious and deadly virus, no matter what people have read on their shady \"news\" sites or watched in YouTube videos. Actual experts and their advice exist. However, as a therapist, I am expected to validate thoughts and resulting ignorant actions as though it could be truth. I'm tired of it. Adults have a responsibility to educate themselves and recognize propaganda. In this case, the ignorance is killing people. Yet, I have to look them in the eye and pretend to understand their views so that I don't cause THEM more psychological harm as they breathe freely in my space without masks during a deadly pandemic. I don't love shaming people but if anyone should be, it is them. People I know have suffered. Some have died. But I can't, because somehow it is just expected that I'll put my health at risk daily, and not doing so could cost me my job, license, etc. I'm just over it, and over these ignorant folks.",

My next two games were up against a sweaty 4 stack that fucked us and mercy ruled us 97-33. However teams were not changed and I was stuck against the same 4 stack the next round, despite the matchup being anything but fair. How the hell does this happen?

    "I'm a cashier and it drives me crazy having to remove every single hanger from clothes. Now it doesn't really bother me if they have a handful of clothes that's fine, but if they just toss a whole pile of clothes and don't sort them or anything, it just gets on my nerves. Do they not realize how long it's gonna take to remove like 30 fucking hangers, and that it's literally holding up EVERYONE ELSE in line???? What makes it worse is that people usually put their clothes up last, so as I'm scanning everything else, they have time to at least take SOME hangers off instead of just dropping a big pile on me. Shout-outs to the customers who actually remove the hangers beforehand or before I start scanning them, it genuinely saves me so much time",

People at the speaker have not only the whole menu, but the opportunity to ask questions about it to the employee at the register. Pulling up to the window and adding to your order messes up the flow for both the window worker and the cook. Now the people behind you have to wait longer while the cook drops extra food with no notice and the cashier has to ring you up again. You messed up the flow for the workers and you're making it inconvenient for other customers. And as we all know, annoyed or angry customers take it out on employees sometimes. Congratulations, your extra order of fries or your added sandwich makes it harder on everyone because you're indecisive. Fast food wage is not worth that nonsense, so please stop.",
    "So I have a dilemma. I am a DM for a couple friends of mine in a campaign that has been going on for just over 2 years now. The characters are level 13. In our last encounter they were running through a castle to try and get to a portal, but they were chased by a beholder. Basically, they were running away and the first three were able to travel through the portal, but the last one didn't make it. With unlucky eye ray rolls, the beholder dropped that last PC to 0 hit points. At this point all the PC's have taken the portal to another plane and in game do not know what has happened with the unconscious PC, and it may take several rounds before they decide to go back. What would a Beholder do in this instance? We are all ok with PC death's but would the beholder just kill them, would it try to enslave them? I want to know what would be most probable in this situation,",

The funny thing is that my father is a matematician but never maanged to teach me him self so we had to pay for teachers all the time. I can't understand math problems at all, what am I doing, why am I doing it, where did this come from, why did we need to count this, what is the point of this, I always ask this when I have math and if I do not repeat the problem over and over and over and over and over again like a total idiotic child, I don't pass. I remember how it is solved instead of actually thinking because I can't think on the spot. I can't know what formula should I use in this and that situation. I never know, somehow those annoying people who are good at math know. I envy them. If you are good at math you will be rich cause you will be good at finances.

    "5 months ago I took 3.5 grams of shrooms. First time on shrooms, but I took acid 4 times before this. I had an amazing trip until ab the 3rd hour, I started peaking. I don’t rmemeber much but let’s just say it was scary and I thought I was dead, extreme paranoia. I’ve been recovering ever since. I’m Not necessarily struggling with depression but more bipolar. One minute I’m wanting to not exist, the next I’m excited for my future and career. I’m finally starting to get back to normal a little bit, my conclusion so far is that life is about perspective, everything is down to perspective. It’s why rich people can be much more sad than poor people. The way we think is relative to the state of mind you are in and your opinion about something can change completely when going through these different states. If we could find a way to manipulate our perspective, we could find the key to success, happiness, and ethic. If you could trick your brain into having a different perspective, you could lower the amount of depressive thoughts you have, your worries about certain things, etc.... so before y’all make a decision, or get down on yourself, take a step back, understand that your perspective isn’t permanent and the way you feel about it can change completely",
    "is it just me or the way Lynette reacts to Tom’s success towards the second half of season 7 is so unbearable to watch. obviously since season 1 she’s always been the control freak and the dominant one over Tom, but after EVERYTHING Tom has been through being a stay at home Dad, making sacrifices for Lynette and always having her back, to see her react so negatively and not be able to ride Tom’s massive successes at work and instead find a way to start an argument is so exhausting. I’m not saying Tom is a saint but him getting excited with his achievements at work is so valid and amazing to see. Throughout his whole arc/story since season one he has never won in his career side. You’d think his wife would be supportive but instead she’s basically jealous and annoyed :/",

Everyone he knew was emphasizing how big of a responsibility this is and how his life will be changed forever.  He seems to be just as good of a person as Sam or Bucky.  They’re justified in being angry at him, but he’s trying his best to do something he is completely unsuited for.  And the people around him aren’t helping at all.  I get why it’s effecting him so much and I don’t blame him or his character.  He inevitably will go over the edge, and do some dirty stuff to smuggle some superhero serum into him which will push him completely over the edge and then Bucky and Sam will have to fight him and it will end with him giving up the shield willingly and showing that he’s good inside still but then thunderbolt Ross will recruit him for the thunderbolts in the after credits.",
    "As i watched the show, i began to notice something very unique that this show has that not too many other do. It has amazing writing and character development. I just LIVE how it isnt focused on a single main character, the show tends to branch out and give each character at least 1 amazing and impactful story of their own. Admittedly, the first season was mainly centered around Q, but the rest of the seasons were perfectly and beautifully spread out between the characters, allowing for amazing development and backstory growth for each one. And not only do they give each character their own amazing story, but they blend them all in together soooo well. For the writing, i just gotta say one thing: Margo. I cant tell you how many times i laughed at some of the things she has said. This show is a perfect example of how shows should be. Theres so much more too than just writing and character development, b ur that may have to be for another post or 2.",

However, I’m still actively training him on walks to essentially remain calm. Still having to throw some kibble down and have him find it if I feel like he’s over threshold. Still having to feed him his dinner via walks in order to attempt loose leash walks and have him look at me when I ask. I’m wondering from people who’ve experienced something similar how long it took for your dog to have calmer walks and when you stopped needing to treat all the time or if you stopped at all. I understand that age is a big factor here and he’s got a lot of energy so when we go on walks, which is already the most exciting thing for him, he’s a lot harder to have remain completely calm. Some walks he’ll walk super nice for me and that’s usually after his energy’s been drained. Some walks he won’t even respond to my commands and that’s when I know he’s over threshold.",

I have always said he's my soul mate. No doubt about it. But he had a drinking problem and needed to grow up. After years of looking for qualities he had in other men. I finally gave up and settled for a man who seemed to love me and my daughter We got pregnant less than 6 months into our relationship. We kept trying and eventually got married. My oldest wanted the same last name and asked to be adopted. My ex-husband agreed to do what he thought his daughter wanted. Current husband turned out to be a liar and master manipulator. Good dad but bad for me. I started seeing a therapist and realized I never have let go of my ex-husband and all the things I wanted to say she said I needed to talk to him or write him a letter. So I did. We talked and we talked and we talked. We both realized we have never been truly happy since we split. He's finally grown up and regrets his mistakes but can't do anything to change them. He only wants to make up for them. So we are here. I'm separated from my current husband and so completely in love with my ex-husband that it's unreal how right it feels.",
    "So as is customary for all my playthroughs for my previous Souls games, my first playthrough is always done with the trusty Claymore and I intend to do the same with my Dark Souls 2 playthrough. At the moment I am making my way through Lost Bastille with my +6 Claymore and while damage isn't much of an issue I found out that scaling in this game is less effective so I was wondering if I should go for a lightning infusion. As of now I only have the minimum stat requirements to two-hand the Claymore. However, I'm not a big fan of miracles and the only one that looks interesting is the Sunlight Blade and I'm not sure if I want to dump all those points into FTH just for that one thing. Also, what should I do against enemies with high elemental resist? I did check out the spellsword guide by u/TheHittite but as I said I'm not sure if I'd want to start investing points into FTH.",
    "I am starting Nofap today in hopes of feeling myself and living myself to the the fullest.

Yet i feel if i have been able to go through a month before i can do it again. I am personally love working out and going to the gym and i think Nofap can help in my fitness journey and even help me in scoring the love of my life. I know this all sounds cringy but i am posting this as a personal memoir to get me through hard times in this journey that as all of us know are the hardest bosses to beat yet i feel committed and motivated to move on.

    "I regularly lose all kinds of attraction for everyone,meaning no sexual or romantic attraction to anyone,meaning no desire to date anyone and looking at content and people that usually would make me feel feel sexually attracted stops doing just that.Those phases usually last between 2 or 4 months and I'm always worried that that my attraction will never come back when I have those phrases,however up until now it always has.Im pretty sure it's not sexual dysfunction becuase that doesnt include loss of romantic attraction and it doesn't affect me in any physical way,its all psychological.Im also sure that I'm not asexual since I do feel all that attraction outside of those phases.I have tried researching my symptoms but I've never really found anything that would match,and it's just really worrying me and I dont even know if its abnormal or  just a normal part of puberty.I also marked it NSFW just to be sure.",
    "So I'm trying to do research and get help from the office of personnel management on my federal retirement benefits I'm kind of at a loss still as to how that's factored. I've got 9 years of federal civilian service with the Army Corps of Engineers I'm 38. In Massachusetts been married for 10 years. From what I understand the TSP and FERS Programs are not handled like a typical retirement plan in a divorce. My attorney doesn't have much info for me That's kind of leaving me at a loss. From what I understand unless the judge puts it in writing directing the office of personnel management to pay out I won't be held liable if the divorce decree just mentioned something about my pension like it's a regular civilian workforce 401k. Because the OPM for the federal government supersedes the state law for a divorce. I still want to make sure I have the right facts and figures though calculating my fund for reporting.",
    "I got canceled around a month ago and it was one of the worst things I've ever went through. I don't know how I'm managing to take things day by day. Before, it may have been possible to learn from your mistakes and build anew. Now, you are crystallized in one single moment in time on the internet and that will haunt you forever. As someone whose incredibly left leaning, its astonishing the passion that proponents of restorative justice will give to some of the worst criminals in society but consider even color blindness as one of the highest offenses a human can commit. For context, I was canceled for a handful of reasons, but one of the main ones was an email correspondence of mine got leaked concerning my criticism of a club officer in my university. I said I found the description of his on the ballot to overly focus on his ethnicity and immutable characteristics versus his qualifications for the job. Someone on the thread found this incredibly offensive and lodged a complaint against me and since it has been publicized, I've been eviscerated within my school community. Its difficult when even the professors you interact with cannot keep their judgment of you out of their eyes. I'm so confused if I'm a bad person or not. This isn't everything, but its just what I have the energy for. I'll explain more later, but for now, what do y'all think?",
    "I have been dipping my my toes in to crypto for the past few weeks from recommendations and advice, but admittedly not really knowing why I’m putting bits of money in to these currencies. I’m so eager to educate myself on each currency individually so I have more of understanding about them. But the main thing I would love to learn is how to trade these currencies for profit.. but I’m not sure where to look as there are so many people who claim to know everything yet they’re more than likely just money grabbers. I have been told to watch sheldon evans as he is supposed to be very educational on the subject. But I don’t think he covers how to profit within crypto, and figuring out where to start is a bit overwhelming.. can anyone assist me on a starting point or even a string of videos I should watch etc. Thanks.",
    "Rewatching the prequels, it seemed the council was very ignorant and didn’t believe the claims of the sith and separatist attacks. For example, in episode 1, they didn’t believe Qui-Gon when he said that the sith had return and instead suspected it was some well trained assassin. Because of this they didn’t take the attack as seriously as they would’ve if they knew a sith was aiding in the attack and I feel that lead to Qui-Gon’s death. Then in the opening of episode 2, Padme says how she suspects Dooku was behind the attempted assassinations and the council dismissed her claims all because Dooku was a former Jedi and it “wasn’t in his character” to kill. This then made we wonder if they could’ve found out who sideous really was if they hadn’t been ignorant and naive before. Maybe they did suspect Palpatine earlier with all his shady deals he seemed to make but didn’t wanna believe they had let a dark lord into power. Even Obi-wan had thought Dooku was wrong when he was told about sideous being in power. It seemed all the evidence was there but they chose to ignore it. What do you think?",
    "Floor Plan 2 was supposed to be released today.  The Oculus site gave today's date and there are even ads on YouTube stating it's release date and saying it's not a joke.  When I went to Oculus to purchase the game, it does not show it for purchase and now has it under \"Coming Soon\" with no specific date beyond sometime in April.  Has anyone heard if there was an issue or new expected date?  I tried going to the Help articles on keyword search on Oculus, but as normal, their help pages stink.  Keywords doesn't find anything and if I try to find articles, I just get sent to videos on how to purchase games for the Rift when I state Quest and Quest 2.

    "I don’t remember what the post was about, but I just saw this guy saying that all republicans should be locked up. I called him hitler, and he replied with “hitler was a republican, I am a democrat is side with the left”. Hitler. Republican. Excuse me? But it doesn’t end there, ladies and gentlemen, I respond with “hitler was a nazi”. He says that anyone who apposes the left is a nazi so that makes him the same as a republican. I said that not everyone who apposes him is a nazi, and he replied with “that’s why we need to imprison everyone who disagrees with the left first because they are the violent ones who want to kill us.” What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. People? Better watch out, this guy is gonna run for president and imprison every “nazi” so that it is only pure people with his beliefs. And it’s not only the fact that he was calling everyone a nazi, it was the fact that the dude was saying he was gonna do exactly why hitler did.

    "Title basically. I have an iPod Mini I recently upgraded, swapping out the 4 gig hard drive for a much larger compactflash card and it's eventual home will be a little cabin I'm building on a plot of land out in the middle of nowhere. It's being stuffed full of audiobooks and radio plays, including from my sizable Audible collection. At the moment I'm downloading my books, converting to MP3, splitting into chapters and then putting on the mini. This is mostly automated for me with the toolchain I've put together with shell scripts, but still takes a pretty long time. The mini is compatible with Audible formats 2, 3 and 4 which would greatly simplify things into drag and drop but for the life of me I can't get audible's servers to spit out the old formats. Is it impossible or is there a trick I'm missing?",
    "So my entire family was really busy last night and my mom ended up getting burger king which I ate because I was super tired and didn't have the energy to make anything else, I got a whopper and a medium french fry but I didn't drink the soda because that stuff is awful, I believe my real weight is 206-207 because I still have food in my system from dinner last night and the night before so I have like 2 days worth of food still in my stomach and I drink a pretty hefty amount of water but that usually leaves my body in the morning when I use the bathroom but with nothing on and in the morning I weigh in at 210.8 and I have a theory.

    "So in recent life I have become very involved in readings and studying philosophical ideas and mindful practices. It is new to me and after I gained my basic understanding I fell in love with these types of things. They have changed me mentally for the better, but exercising mindfulness always, daily is still a long road to go. Anyways I'm sure we are all familiar with the idea of happiness being within the ability to live in the moment and go with the flow per se. I see the benefit in letting the past go for sure. And I understand accepting life leaving no room for shattered predictions to cause me anguish. But alot of my self reflection is realizing I never take my future seriously and kind of just always thought things were destined to happen without having to apply any effort. This has caused alot of unnecessary turmoil in life. So to what extent is it implied to live in the present, not for the future. Like, how can we fulfill any dream potentially, when we take life as it comes without judgement. Is the idea that youd simply be happy everyday therefore no particular goals even exist to shatter? Like dont plan for retirement, a future vacation, a cook out next week, nothing? Or am I not seeing the deeper meaning? I feel as I type this I'm realizing the idea is that my dependence on what is required to make me happy in days to come is an aspect of unhappiness therefore I just dont understand being naturally happy all the time in spite of goals that could potentially become shattered personal worth. Sorry for the length, thanks in advance yall.",
    "I’m still basically closeted but I’m struggling to make any progress transitioning. I’ve barely learned makeup because I’m so overwhelmed by it, I can’t figure out how to feminise my voice despite all the advice I’ve seen and I’m too scared to wear girl stuff except in my own home when the curtains are closed. HRT and surgery are beasts that I’m nowhere near tackling at the moment, so I guess my question is how do I motivate myself to further my transition? I always want to learn makeup and stuff but I can’t ever get around to it so I just end up sitting in my room browsing r/transtimelines and r/traa.

    "When my son was seven I took him to Dover Castle.  Neither he or I were aware of specific hauntings at the castle prior to the visit.  After a great day we returned home.  On tucking my son up in bed that night we chatted about the day and he asked me about a woman he’d seen dressed in a long red dress.  I thought it odd, although he was clearly not scared but more intrigued by her enough to ask me who she was.    I had not seen anyone matching the description although had been with my son throughout the day.   I thought nothing about it until a day or two later when, out of general curiosity I googled the castle and discovered that it is famous for being haunted with several ghosts one of which was a lady in a long red dress exactly where my son had seen her.",
    "This sounds extremely sarcastic but I promise it's not. I drive the speed limit at all times no matter what because I'm neurotic and cannot afford to get pulled over and have my car insurance increase. So obviously people pass me constantly. Almost every car that ends up behind me. I'm not stupid so I've inferred that people don't drive the speed limit so I should be at traffics speed, and I must be annoying. Sorry to anyone that I've inconvenienced. I just don't understand the point of having posted speed limits that no one follows yet you can still legally get pulled over and ticketed for not following them. I'm genuinely confused if this is an unspoken rule that everyone understands and I'm just not in the loop. Why do we need to go so fast anyway? What's the rush guys???",

    "I’ve been listening to kpop for 3 years now and I never really watched kdramas up until last year well technically I have but only seen 3. The first one I watched was in 2019 and I never finished it and then I watched and finished two in 2020. My friend and everyone on the internet talks about the latest dramas some popular ones I’ve heard of is “what’s wrong with secretary kim” and “crash landing on you.” I guess when I got into kpop I was mainly focused on kpop so I never took the time to actually watch kdramas and I still don’t  to this day. I’ve seen stuff about how some people like for dramas to take their time with the plot and that it catches them off guard when things move to fast. And I feel like that’s why I don’t watch them because I get bored easily and if it takes to long to get to the point I’m not gonna finish it. I’ve tried but I just can’t finish them and I’ll catch myself pausing and clicking the video to see how long it takes. But I feel like I’m the only kpop fan who really isn’t into kdramas cause everyone watches them. But... idk lol.",
    "Not every conservative buys into the lie that this election was stolen. Sidney Powell even admitted no reasonable person would believe the lies she told about the election. But some polls have found up to 67% of republicans think the election was invalid. This is very different than saying the election was swayed by a foreign party. No democrat questioned whether Trumps votes were real in 2016. They questioned the process he used to get them. We also have a dangerous cult that mainly republicans or conservatives prescribe too, Qanon. This movement is built on lies but has convinced a significant minority of the population that pedophiles run every aspect of government. From a conservative perspective, how would you deal with a group of people who don't want to hear the truth?",

    "I’m not one to complain but I was enjoying this game until getting into the endgame. I sunk way too many hours getting farmed up got a bunch of legendaries on world tier 15. I was building a trickster bullet build and now the whole set up I have is just useless solo. I deal a good amount of damage but not enough to solo CT9. I don’t have anyone to play with so I tried to play with randoms and it just made it considerably harder as they didn’t have the gear to compete at the CT. Matchmaking has something to be desired. Regardless, expeditions are just not enough fun and dying at the end of the run is just frustrating. It was cool for a week. Glad this was on gamepass.

For example I need to go clean and I’m at peak excitement so I need to type this quick. For the past 30 minutes I have been playing roblox and getting myself prepared and excited to clean. Then once I go to clean I am locked in focus, because if someone distracts me with a different task, like if my mom asks me to vacuum out the car while I’m getting ready to clean, I’ll have to vacuum at the car, then take another 15, 30 minutes scrolling through social media or something to re-excite myself and re-energize my brain before I go clean. If I don’t take those breaks I will get stressed. My parents don’t get why I sit on my phone instead of just going to clean. Lol. Is this an adhd thing or no?",
    "my WIP I'm currently working on is a zombie fiction book that takes quite a bit from 28 Days Later in that it focuses on a few select characters and their struggles, fears, and reactions to the world breaking down around them, and how their relationships grow while they try to survive the outbreak. My biggest issue is that the world doesn't really feel lived in. You know how in the new Stars Wars trilogy, it feels like nothing else is happening except for what you see on screen? My writing has the same issue, it feels like there's nothing going on outside of what the characters are experiencing. Any ideas or tips on how I could make the world/ outbreak seem more in-depth than just what the characters see? I'm debating putting less focus on the characters and more into the scenarios they're in, just to try and see if that helps.",
    "In my opinion Charmx isn’t leaving. The fact that it still shows that he still has 2.4K videos is pretty fishy, they could all possibly be unlisted or maybe deleted which could suck for him. My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s. So One of two things could happen tomorrow, He Rick Rolls us and lists all his videos back, or he won’t post at all and that’ll be it. The End.",
    "This started before I went on vacation, but out of know where or it came on gradually a burning and discomfort pain inside my penis all the way up to the groin. The thing is when I pee I don’t feel any burning it comes out normally. But after I pee i still feel the pain maybe even worse. It also feels like I have to pee when I don’t. It just feels all inflamed and burning inside of there. It’s been going on for I’d say 5-6 days now. The worse part is I’m on vacation and dealing with this sucks, I can’t even relax on vacation. I’ve had a hard time sleeping too. I made a doctors appointment for Monday. I’m just trying to see if anyone else experienced these symptoms.  It was worse when I took CBD too thought it would help. I’ve also been peeing a lot since this started too I guess my body is trying to flush this out if it is something.",
    "I know it's pretty broad, but I do wonder how people manage to deal with stress. The last few years, especially since 2018, I've been getting worse and worse at dealing with stress. For example, I procrastinate a lot and this has been a big source of stress. My home life has been stressful because I live with my parents right now and their marriage is lowkey falling apart. I'm also stressed because there is a lot of ucnertainty around my future and career prospects. Some of my friendships are also a source of stress sometimes. Overall, the past year has been the worst year I've had as long as I can remember. I do think that I don't have healthy ways of dealing with stress. I internalise a lot of it because that's probably pretty much what I've always done. Living with my parents has made me realise that our relationships isn't great and that living with them isn't good for my mental health. My question is how do you guys deal with stress? Are there things you can do to help deal with unhealthy patterns of dealing with stress? In addition to the things I've mentioned, I also have other issues related to low self-esteem, bouts of depression, avoiding social settings and I'm generally an anxious person. I'm often told that I worry too much and that I'm overthinking. It has been like this on and off for at least 2 years. I suspect I may have some sort of undiagnosed mental illness, but I can't really talk to a professional right now. Where I live right now there is a lot of stigma around this. So this is a pretty complicated situation.",

    "I mean we got a mecha version of goji but this time as a literal jaeger gone rogue, and since apparently there was a way to solve the power issue by using the hollow earth to power the mech, I think jaegers would be extrmely possible if not make a potential protagonists in a future movie, like imagine something called destroy all monsters, and there's a new muto species risen, monarch and apex industries along with the UN agree to building super mechs as a solution, and by learning to not use titan brains and to use a pilot cockpit to prevent a neural overload that can kill the pilot, and we can have super mechs with dark olive green camo with a heavily armored design like cherno alpha with military weaponry, then perfecto we have our version of monsterverse jaegers, and can have doom style like finisher moves on the mutos or potential titans, that would be perfect.",
    "So I’ve been learning the basics of forex and when to take trades through IM academy. Basically I know more or less when to take a trade through hourglass using the Cashtrap strategy. It shows you possible trades you could take. The educator says that just using indicators on hourglass you could win 60-70% of your trades. I’ve learned the point system they use to have more confirmations to know whether or not a trade is good to take or not. The problem I’m having is that the educators seem to kinda of repeat themselves over and over and I don’t think I’m learning anything more than what they are saying. They are trying to pass it off as something so simple when in actuality it’s not. I follow the strategy exactly how it was taught but I still seem to lose. I paid a lot of money to learn this and it’s starting to feel like a scam almost. I understand that the market does it’s own thing and you can’t predict right every trade but following everything I’ve been taught I still can’t seem to predict right. I have good and bad days but it’s confusing to know where I should be placing trades and I feel helpless because the educators are on repeat mode every time they go live.",
    "I’ve been going to a trauma therapist for about 4 months.  I’m a male in my 40s and done therapy before but never focused on trauma.  Holy crap she is really helping me.  One thing I’ve learned about is how much I dissociate and how this has been a defense mechanism since was a kid.  She has been gently letting me know that I may have some degree of DID or dissociative identity disorder.  This was pretty scary at first but I’m thinking that she may be on to something.  I don’t have multiple identities on the outside that anyone would notice, but it’s clear that my childhood trauma caused me to have splintered off parts of self that have never been integrated.  Those parts of self are in regular conflict with each other and the result is anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.  My life fell apart a few years ago and lost my business of 15 years and almost burned my marriage down.  I somehow survived long enough to stabilize and now I’m doing the work to process my trauma.  It’s scary but I’m still here. My therapist thinks I’m almost ready to start emdr.  I’m slowly starting to have little glimmers of hope.",
    "I know certain foods affect the luck of certain party members but beyond that is there any point in choosing to go further away than the nearest food vendor? There's so many it makes me wonder. There's the ramen shop, the cafe, three vending machines or you can go buy consumables at heeho mart and that's just in shibuya. Then there's the crepe store and more vending machines in harajuku, not to mention if you go to the end of illusory shibuya or go into illusory urahara you can get a free heal at the green spot on the floor. None of these options are insanely overpriced compared to the rest, they're all less than 1k yen per use. I don't get it. Also what does luck do actually? Is it worth going out of my way to raise luck?",
    "I see a lot of \"wish lists\" for Titanfall 3 and I see a lot of good ideas like larger scale battles, breakable objects, more titans, more weapons, etc. however I believe that there is something that would be so much more important and impactful than anything that I don't see mentioned much. Mapping tools. Even the simplest of mapping tools can go a long way in the hands of a creative person. All it needs to be is a few geometrical shapes. people will go wild. It would also be an amazing way to elongate Titanfall 3's lifespan, even after they stop releasing content updates for the game, there would still be a near infinite amount of user-generated content, for example take Portal 2, which came out 10 years ago, still has people making puzzles and maps with the provided tools. With all of the user-generated content, Respawn wouldn't have to keep putting out updates to keep the community interested, so they could also focus on Apex Legends at the same time. I think if we got a map maker along the lines of Halo's forge, it would make Titanfall 3 infinitely better.",
    "I’ve done my research on both branches in-depth, but the CG seems like you will be a non-rate for some odds months, which isn’t bad but waiting 2-3 years is not something I’d want to do knowing the jobs I want are all filled up. Navy seems to have what I’d truly want when it comes to ratings and making it into a career for the long term. I know AF has better QoL but so does CG and Navy to a good degree, it’s what you make but when it comes to travel it comes down to Navy and CG but I’ve had Coasties admit on subreddits that the Navy is more international and travels to Europe, Middle Eastern and Asian countries a lot of course and if they want to live overseas they can if they so choose too CG has international bases and whatnot but not like the Navy I’d imagine. I know everyone’s experiences vary greatly but for me I believe Navy would be best suited for me personally when it comes to what job I want and the technical skills I’d gain.",
    "Siege is just dead for me sadly. Even tho it is my most played game and it has brought me so many great memories, i just cannot keep with the game in its current state. Its impossible to rank up now. I tired of tbagging mnk, mmr exploits and glitches were i lose 60-80mmr, because the enemy team made a fucking exploit. I used to be exited with the arrival of a new season, but now im just done. The bugs, exploits, glitches, constant mnk encouter, boring gamemodes and the overall direction of Siege. Those who are interested buying Siege om console, i will tell you this, dont buy it. It used to be good on console, but now, its not worth the grind. Take this from a player who is lvl 304, reached diamond and has been playing since skull rain. Had to just blow off my anger. All of this is just my opinion.",

    "We were getting ice cream and the lady in front of us paid for my family’s ice cream because there was a mix-up and the guy in front of her paid for her and her daughter’s ice cream. So we paid for the family behind us and the pay it forward went on for like another 4-5 groups. Today was a beautiful day. It’s really the little things. Edit: the comments are a dumpster fire and the exact reason why I’m usually so hesitant to ever post here. It was just a nice little expression of humanity to experience after a rough couple of months, you guys. The sun was out. It was a nice day. Come on. Edit 2: also, no one is obligated to continue a chain of paying it forward- if it’s not in your budget or interest the responsibility is on you to set a boundary and say “no thanks,” feelings of peer pressure or what anyone thinks be damned because it is your time and your money and the strangers around you can’t read your mind/inner dialogue or anticipate your emotions- nor should they. Paying it forward is not supposed to be transactional or for explicit tangible gain- it’s just a nice thing someone does and moves on— like the people who were long gone by the time I discovered they paid for our ice cream. I won’t let the overwhelming negativity and the embarrassing projections/ ascribing insidious intentions in the comments detract from the lovely moment it was.",
    "I have installed a Furrion three camera system that includes a rear view and two side cameras. I used existing marker light power for the constant 12v power and spliced a line off of the turn signal wires to the camera signal wire so they may be activated automatically when using my turn signal. When the system is powered up and the view all screen is selected the turn signals will appropriately activate the corresponding camera, however once it has sat idle for about 30 seconds it will default to the left side camera and will Stay there, even if the right turn signal is activated. If you manually touch the monitor and change it back to view all it will work again until idle for several seconds then it switches to the left camera.  Any ideas?",
    "Recap: I fell like a rag doll on my foot and injured myself. Particularly I had a bruise on top and the sole of my foot that was very painful. My husband is a physician and agreed that my foot was fractured, but also agreed with redditors that it was a Lisfranc fracture and would need close observation. I cannot thank enough the kind advice about lisfranc fractures. The X-ray revealed it was indeed a Lisfranc fracture and would require casting to maintain immobility, as well as no weight bearing for many weeks. Unfortunately, because I have Axonal Charcot Marie Tooth, this was my good leg. So currently I am bed bound until I once again bear weight on this foot, if ever. Since my neurological decline has been so rapid, I am forced to remain immobile for the foreseeable future. Life just handed me all of the lemons at once like the world’s suckiest lottery prize. Overall though, I am stable and safe, so life could be worse. Thank you again for caring enough to offer your wonderful advice. I really appreciate it.",
    "I went down a very deep rabbit hole today. I have an oculus quest 2 and was playing it on my 4 year old system. I just upgraded the other day to a b550 gaming-f wifi board with ryzen 5 5600x cpu. Now the mobo isn't reading the quest 2 when I connect it to the computer. It was usb is not working. I have tried every single usb port on the computer. I have gone through and checked every driver. I have reinstalled all the oculus programs and drivers. Then I saw that there is a new bios patch for usb connectivity problems. Figured that would solve it. Tried the usb flashback and it did the 5 flashes and wouldn't work. Then I tried going into the bios and using a bootable flash drive, but it said it wasnt a valid boot. Then I tried the EZ flash through the asus ai suite 3. This said that there was no need to update the bios. When I check the version of the bios it says 1202. When I look at the patch it says version 2006. Am I reading something wrong? And to go back to the original problem, anyone have troubles getting the quest 2 to read with the mobo. I plugged my quest2 into my 7 year old laptop and it immediately came up so I think its the mobo. Have had no troubles with it other than in this instance.",
    "This startet a while back when I for some reason kept smelling sour cream and onion pringles despite none being anywhere in the house. I found it odd but I assumed my parents had some that they hid from me, but then it happened on the train, in school and at my girlfriend's place. Then I smelled whiskey with a slight note of vanilla, despite the whiskey being closed. Neither of my parents drink and my whiskey doesn't smell like vanilla. Could this have something to do with me being able to perfectly remember and mix tastes in my head? I mean, once I've eaten something, I remember every little note of its taste and I can mix and match it with every other one of the tastes in my head. Should I go to my doctor about this?",
    "I think that Isayama is an incredible writer, the manga as a whole is proof of that. But a lot of people have problems with this final arc, namely that a lot of characters get plot armor. I think this is because Isayama made Eren and the founding Titan way too overpowered. With how powerful Eren is, of course there's going to be some plot armor for those who oppose him. Like why can't he just use paths to stop every single person who opposes him in his tracks? The only logical explanation could be that he didn't want to, which I guess we will find out in 139. Still, I just really feel that Isayama made the FT too super powerful, and then of course still had to make a compelling final conflict so he had to nerf Eren in some way and give the Alliance some plot armor moments. I think if he had maybe written the Founding Titan to not be as powerful as it is this final conflict would be much better. I'd love some opinions",
    "Argus new changes in the advanced server is really bad. This is due to his base Physical Atk and growth being nerfed significantly. Furthermore we got a stun duration nerf for a range buff, but a range buff wasn’t needed yet that stun duration is crucial and the reason why i would even call it argus best skill.  all of this huge nerfs just for passive being 320% yet this depends on his physical atk so the nerfs actually nerfs this buff as well. So in conclusion. This changes overall nerfs argus. Current live argus is great tbh. a small buff instead to like 280% is suffice or just the quality of life like the animation stop i would say instead of basically nerfing him more in terms of dmg cause -75 is A LOT",
    "I got a bunch of money back from taxes today and I was excited because I wouldn’t have to worry about my bills. Then I decided to try to think of a way to treat myself. All I could think of was you. I wish I could take you out for eel sushi, and I’d get your favorite beer, and your favorite bread. It would be so worth it to know you’re eating properly and see the huge smile you get on your face whenever you have your favorite food. We could do something really special together. Now thinking of that money opens up a pit in my stomach I’ve tried to think of something else to use it on but it all pales compared to you. I’d give the whole sum up entirely to speak to you again or just to know if you were safe and happy. Yesterday was trans day of visibility I hope your day was safe and you had a good time. I hope no one said anything rude. I pray for your safety every day. I can never stop loving you, and I don’t think I’ll ever climb out of this dark pit.

    "The 2020-2021 school year is my first year of high school and it has been miserable, with little hope for it to get better. Everyone is forced to wear a mask and because of this, I never see anyone’s face, which, before all of this, I didn’t know was a necessity. As of now half of my teachers are all virtual meaning that we have to wear headphones and join an hour long Google Meet with a mask on in a classroom without even the slightest possibility of an interaction, even with the person sitting next to you. In the halls, almost no one talks to each other and no one talks to me. Even when ANY decent social interaction happens the teacher separates the two people for being too close together. On top of this, we are given hours and hours of tedious, meaningless homework, as if we’re not miserable enough but the people in charge don’t give a shit. Everything that was once helped me grow in school or at least made it tolerable is now gone and I know who took it from me. Being stuck in a blue town in a blue county in a blue state, change could be very slow but I am fucking fed up.",
    "That was an interesting experience. Two minutes into my meditation and my mind decided it was a good idea to freak out for no discernible reason. Heart rate seemed to hit 1000, rapid breathing, tingling, tightening sensations. Felt so strange to just observe them all - remember thinking at one point, \"Wow, my entire body's going absolutely crazy. Holy shit.\" I never thought I would be able to detach myself enough from my thoughts and bodily sensations that I could passively sit through something like that. I've been meditating for almost a month now, and I guess if I needed concrete proof that my meditation was having an effect, there it is. I just anchored on the breath and observed my body going crazy and felt all the sensations until it passed. I have never been able to do that in my life.",

I ordered a part to fix my AC on my car. Wrong part. My day is ruined. Can’t just do something rational to problem solve, apparently. My day is ruined and I have to go lay down and dissociate away somewhere else. I haven’t been like this since I was a kid. I don’t know why I’m aging backwards in emotional maturity. Nothing about this stuff is complicated but my brain is like “nope. this is too hard. go break something or scream. if you’re not going to do that then go to sleep and imagine somewhere nicer than this.” I’m an adult toddler who is very good at choosing naps as their particular time out. I could deal with that if I wasn’t catapulting myself in the wrong direction where progress is concerned.",
    "I am in a situation where I need 31 more credits after this semester to graduate. However, I am in my second year in UofM engineering right now. I want to know if I should take the 15 and 16 credits to graduate in 3 years or if I should look at possibly doing a co-op or two and graduate in 4 years. I also want to know if graduating in Winter is a good option as well. Personally, I don't really like the idea of graduating in 3 years after a year and a half of covid school but also want to not waste money taking unnecessary classes.

    "I am developing a disaster recovery plan and am having some trouble when it comes to managed AD.  We have no on-prem AD so everything is on a managed AD directory in a single region.  We use it with Windows EC2 instances, File Gateway and RDS for authentication, nothing fancy.  We have EC2 AMIs, S3 replication and RDS snapshots being copied to a second region.  The AMIs will be joined to the existing domain already and have IIS domain user accounts as well.  Creating a new directory is going to break that though.  The only solution I can see is to have a custom user script that will leave and rejoin the new AD and re-setup the user accounts when launching the AMI, but that seems overly complex.  Other than moving to enterprise AD, does anyone have any suggestions on how to make this work?",
    "I am 16 and own a 66/80cc 2 cycle motorized bicycle I recently came across an issue with my carburetor leaking fuel due to the float needle not stopping the flow of gas coming from my tank, therefore, causing the carb to overflow. I did not know how to fix this issue so I installed a flow valve on my fuel line with the flow valve installed I can turn on and off the gas flow to the carb. To fix my issue I turn on the fuel valve thus allowing gas to flow into my carb and once the carb starts to leak I turn it off, now that I have my carb filled with gas I can ride my bike for about 2 to 3 miles before running out of gas in my carb I then fill it back up by turning on my fuel valve. I know this is not the best solution and am probably decreasing my engine's life span but it is all that I came up with. I then thought why not get rid of my gas tank altogether and just oversize my carb's float bowl. Please let me know what you guys think of this idea and if I should patent it or not.",

    "Ok I don't even know if this is possible I am incredibly new to all of this and I will most likely be back for more help in future.  Me and my friend are working on making a joke game in the style of pokemon for us to play but we go to different colleges in different states.  The game is still in the very early stages but I like to plan ahead, so while I'm sure it's not insanely complicated to do local multiplayer for those Pokemon style battles I'm not sure how this would work in an online aspect.  I really don't have the resources to set up a server and as a college student I definitely don't have the resources to rent one.  And while I know that there are plenty of free services out there they often seem shady and even if they aren't if more of our friends get in on this and play the game I don't want the server to just start crashing on them because it's a system out of my control.  So is there a way to do the simple Pokemon style of battling over plane old internet without a server?  If it is simply not possible I will just focus on the single player aspect and stick with local play but I want to explore all options, if online battles are possible without a server I want to give it a try and still have local be an option for when we are able to meet up.",

    "As a young person and recent defector of the Liberal/Democrat ideology, I have been thinking about the state of our culture and time here in America. Every day I feel myself compelled to stand up and speak in an act of revolution against the status quo. I feel as if God is telling me to follow my heart and speak the truth as an artist against the untruth. But fear is prevalent. Most art, film, music, writing are dominated by ideologically liberal leaning people. Websites where artists gather to advertise their work like YouTube and Facebook are censoring and banning voices that have Conservative values and ideas. How far can I get as an artist down this path? I feel like a bird being forced to crawl on the ground feeling so desperate and hopeless wanting to use the gift and passion my God has given me. In this time when the voice of a conservative is a revolutionary act, are there enough minds out there that would support or be interested in conservative art?

    "Honestly people who are gay Christians need to stop going through loop holes to try to not make homosexuality a sin in Christianity. The Bible has about six passages in which it can be taken as condemning homosexuality. I’m not arguing that Christians should attack gay people but I believe not calling it a sin in the Bible is off at best and disingenuous at worst. EVERY single verse is a mistranslation or has an alternative reasoning? And even if that was true most of the early church didn’t agree homosexuality wasn’t sinful. I think a better way to think is “the Bible says this but I still believe in God” or “I don’t care if being gay is a sin but I’m still a Christian” but throwing shotty reasoning isn’t doing you or anybody else any justice.",

    "Okay, so like the title says, i am currently using Gnome 40 on the nightly build Iso, i am using the 5.11 kernel. I wanted to try some games using Gnome 40 because i had heard they improved their compositor since last using Gnome 3.38, boy i was surprised. Every game i had played with NVIDIA, no longer screen tears in game. The performance is really great too, i was getting about 160 fps average at 1080p on No mans sky, ultra settings. Gnome has taken a very big step since i have last used it and it shows, not to mention the look and feel of it is superb. i was always an Advocate for XFCE, mainly because with NVIDIA cards on the newer compositor versions there is also no screen tearing, however once Gnome 40 releases on Manjaro officially, i may just only use Gnome. We will see though",
    "Hey everyone, what are some tips and advice on how to make your body smell extremely good 24/7? I would like recommendations from diets to deodorants to which fabric softener or detergent to use to wash your clothes, which product to use on your face and hair, which body wash, body lotions, body oils, perfume, showering technique, dental hygeine, flossing technique, anything, to use to make your body and mouth smell like heaven. I can make my hair smell really good, I use Amike Soulfood nourishing hair mask, Morrocanoil leave-in conditioner, Morrocanoil treatment, and Briogeo Anti-Frizz heat protectant.

Everything I read about monsteras is that they will burn in direct sun, so I’m worried about summer coming and having almost no shade. Does anyone else have a monstera that loves direct sun? Or am I about to kill my plant?",
    "Eu tenho 18 anos e tô medindo 1,75m e pela primeira vez em todos esses anos eu tô me sentindo um total fracasso só porque minha perna parou de crescer. E a pior parte é que eu nunca fui chamado de baixinho, nunca que eu citei minha altura, uma garota ficou \"eca\", na verdade, acho que faz muito tempo que eu não recebo uma ofensa relacionada a minha aparência. Eu me considero uma pessoa atraente, legal, inteligente e blá blá blá, porém de tanto ver meme de \"menos de 1,80 pra mim é amigo\" eu comecei a ficar lelé da cuca imaginando que eu vou ser rejeitado em qualquer lugar que eu vou só porque não é bem visto eu usar salto alto. Alguma dica de como resolver isso? Ou eu tenho muito pé na bunda pra levar por não ter uma altura de um viking?",
    "So currently I am debating between Rutgers, NJIT Honors college and TCNJ Honors College. I thought I could make the honors program at Rutgers since my GPA and SAT scores are above their average, but I got an email saying my application was rejected. I would go to Rutgers, but many people say that the class sizes are too big and it’s really hard to make any meaningful connections with professors. They also say that it’s hard to schedule classes at times that are convenient for you since registration fills up quickly. I am looking to go to med school after college, but I plan on doing an easy major, like maybe arts or public health for GPA sake. Can I get some opinions from you guys? Sorry this post is so long",
    "Title's the best I could think of to describe this issue but this is... A strange one. Basically, my Moonlander had been working fine for some time, with LEDs showing what I configured, and overall not presenting any issues. However, starting a few months after my keyboard arrived, the LEDs started doing... Strange things. It seems like every few power cycles it cycles through some seemingly default backlight annimations. Sometimes it's ripples of different colours, sometimes it's one solid colour, sometimes a gradient, etc. I noticed that, with enough restarts it would cycle back to the actual setting, but it never stayed there. It's gotten to the point where now the LED's aren't turning on at all, which can get a bit annoying. Has anyone experienced this or has my keyboard gone insane?",
    "What actually was the point of the rumbling? 80% of the population got obliterated, war still goes on, most likely the rest of the world will hate and discriminate on eldians even if they don’t have the ability to turn into titans anymore, the jaegarists hated the outside world and wanted the rumbling to finish, so they still hate everyone else, so you’re telling me Eren did this for his friends sake? His motive to avenge his mother and hate the world because of the amount of hate between races are just gone. I just don’t get why he did it, and I don’t want some bs reason like “it was fate” or “to save Eldians” like please it’s not like Eldians are safe they are 50 years behind technology and now that they don’t have titan powers they can’t even defend themselves and they still want to go for war. Also Historias character became absolutely irrelevant, I don’t know why they even showed the girl who idolised mikasa for a bit and who’s to say the jaegarists would listen to the “peace ambassadors” who literally killed their god eren jaegar. I just don’t get the ending of the story, it makes so little sense",
    "Apologizes for all my recent posts to this sub lately. Found out today that I failed AUD with a 71. On test day I woke up feeling extremely foggy and mentally unfocused, and I feel like this is a large reason why I failed. The testing centers near me have openings next Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, so I’m heavily contemplating retaking the exam next week. Would studying full time between now and next Wednesday/Thursday be enough for a pass? Not sure if I should put my all into studying for the next 6-7 days and try to schedule a retake next week, or if I should take my time and schedule it for a few weeks out. I feel like all of the information is still very fresh in my mind, which is why I kind of have this need to take it immediately. Any advice is appreciated.",

It’s emotionally draining for us to be crammed in here and having to raise my child in a house of toxicity is never what I envisioned for myself. We’ve never been to a shelter before but we do get food stamps and cash assistance from the city. I contacted homebase last year and was told that since I was not in a shelter and had no shelter history that I was not eligible for any of their help.

    "I am a 25F. I always thought I would be married by the time I reach 26, but I was so wrong. Being born in a conservative country, I never had any pressure to lose virginity, here virginity before marriage is kinda frowned up on. But people do marry young here, most of the girls get married by 25 and the guys at 35. Here, people who are not married by the time they reach 30s, people think there is something wrong with them. But here I am 4 years away from being 30 unmarried and a virgin. Being a virgin has never bothered me till 2 years ago. I feel like every day that goes by you are getting older and older and every thing that you do in life has a age bracket like studies, getting a job, marriage and when you exceeds that it becomes 10 times more difficult and society kind down upon you and makes you feel like a failure. Life is unfair at times.",
    "I am really tired of people ignoring me when I need them the most. Friends, family, strangers etc. I try my hardest to be there for people and I get nothing in return. The fact that last couple of days I have been having suicidal thoughts and no one really cares. I think nobody cares about me. I am trash to other people. I always get used and get hurt cause I am too emotion for my own well being. I just want to not wake up in the mornings cause I know for a fact my life means nothing to anyone or even myself. Everyone see me as a happy person and always willing to do things for other and suck people dicks. When I want something in return I feel like I just get brush off to the side. Always the 3rd wheel for everything. I have tried reaching out to others, but I realize we all have our shit to deal with too. I wish my friends and family are as transparent as I am with them. I feel like no body cares if I just leave this place. I got ways to end it all too. For a fact I am just typing this cause I do have anyone to talk to about anything. I am a dumb fuck. I will never to be able to express my feeling to other people, cause it is not fair. I am hurting too and no body knows that. I really cant take this stuff anymore. I am really tried of everything maybe an eternal sleep will be the best.",
    "Im 18 every attempt ends in failure. I’m not owed anything but man it’s lonely putting your head on your pillow at night. Im at a point where I have no self esteem or confidence, because im not desired. This is not a post to garner sympathy i just realized most attempts end in failure. I must accept the outcome and move on, i make women uncomfortable everyday but I’m trying to get a new gameplan. It’s so lonely with no gf and when i realized I couldn’t get one involuntarily when I was 16 I knew then thati would have a hard time. Unbelievable sorrow i cannot relay in this post, constant heartbreaks. Rejection is normal for me, I don’t even know y i try. Left on delivered for 8 hours then it says opened. Man i am a weak man im not strong. It’s like a wound that gets worse by the day. 300 girls said no to me, no girls ever liked me.

I was hitting blackjacks left and right, I won all my double downs and i ended up with 3600 pounds. I then said it would be my last bet and put down 500 pounds. I lost. Thats when i blanked out. I kept putting 500 down till i was at zero. Then I though if i could do it once, i could do it again. I kept depositing money, and before i knew it i had 6 pounds in my bank for the rest of the month. I am currently visitinh my girlfriend and its been a week shes been giving me money for food.

    "This kid at my school who is always a prick to my friend was sitting across the room from me at Starbucks, and it was basically empty except for us, but he couldn’t see me from the angle he was sitting at and didn’t realize I was there working on school stuff. He was having a scholarship interview over zoom and I was eavesdropping since I’m nosy. It was pretty obvious that he’s one of those people who gets extremely nervous during interviews because he was like vibrating the whole time, and she asked him a question mid-way through that he couldn’t answer, and then it was awkward silence for a minute and then he kinda started crying. I actually felt bad and cringed from how uncomfortable it was.

Should I be this ruined over someone this early in my life? Should someone at the age of 16 be this down over someone? Who knows, honestly, and who cares. I finally found a way to talk to you, but I don’t know what you’ll say. I don’t know how you will react to someone saying my name, and meaning me.

    "I live in Sacramento California for context. My property management company has still not fixed my heating after three written requests through their maitenence request system, and several phone calls. We never called to have it fixed ourselves because w friend advised me not to as I could end up stuck with the bill. The management company “cancelled” two of our requests and the third still shows up as open and “technician contacted”, but that’s been that way since December. I’m certain this has to be illegal as the apartment would regularly reach 40 degrees through the winter since it has single pane wooden frame windows that have almost no thermal insulation value. What exactly am I able to do here? They don’t return my calls anymore for anything other than payment, and hang up if I mention the heat.",
    "It seems like every game that is released now is unfinished and pushed out the door as quickly as it can be for the sake of the company collecting the sales off it with the business model of going back and actively fixing what’s wrong and essentially completing their game via updates and patches. This is not how you make games and it seems like not a single company out there has their finger on the pulse of the consumer saying, “hey they don’t like when this happens” because it keeps happening and not a single company learns from another companies mistakes. Why is this and how can we as consumers get the message across that this is not cool and is seriously dampening the video game experience as we progress into the future?",
    "I made a Hefeweizen with mostly Pilsner malt and some white wheat. eBIAB five gallon batch if you’re interested. There was some Munich malt for some flavor as well. I wanted to try something different than a traditional Hefeweizen, so I boiled with Tettnang for bittering , but added Citra at 10 minutes, and a light Citra/Mosaic dose at flameout. It went into the fermenter as clear as any other hefe, but soon after I pitched with the two packs of Lellamand Munich Classic Wheat Beer Yeast, it clouded up a lot. Six days out from the pitch it’s still uber-cloudy. It’s been anywhere between 64-68 degrees for most of the ferment. I’m sure there’s nothing wrong with it, but I’m wondering if the cloudiness is coming from the yeast, the hop proteins, or a combination of the two. I’ll cold crash for a few days at the end, but was wondering if anyone has seen something similar. Thoughts?",

    "I see people praising AJR and saying the haters don't know real music, or something on those lines. I see where they come from, but I do like AJR. The undying faith to AJR with some of these fans are getting out of hand. Yes, you can like AJR, no, not everyone will like it. People hating AJR have their own opinions, and anything you say or do won't change that. Music is a hard thing to change people's minds on. It's not like politics, but it seems like Trump supporters vs Biden supporters out here. The passion of AJR's fans is earned, but AJR is either an aquired taste or you just enjoy their music. AJR is not perfect. They are not the best, but for most of us here, they are up there. I love AJR's music, but it has flaws, and that's ok.",
    "I don’t know how exactly to explain this, but when I was little, I used to get these breathing “bursts.” What I mean by that is there were times when I would breath in as if to take a deep breath, but instead of a normal deep breath it felt like I was breathing in happiness. Bare with me I know this sounds crazy. This was a feeling of all over calming, clean, comforting, burst of I don’t know what to call it. It would happen at different times like while was playing or other random times. It would happen maybe a couple of times a week from what I remember. All I know is that it happened regularly throughout my childhood but stopped sometime before my teen years. I’ve never felt it again. I think of this from time to time and wonder if maybe it was some sort of spiritual experience. I really don’t know but I’ve never met anyone else who has experienced this. Any thoughts?

    "Every damn time I go to Champ’s or Footlocker at our mall, my Dad and I play a game of seeing how long it takes for an employee to rush at us and greet us trying to sell shit, part 2 of the game is guessing how many employees rush over on separate occasions.

I am pretty particular in my taste in clothing, so I pretty much know immediately if I want something.

Your lust for a sale completely loses me, you can be enthusiastic without approaching every single person.

    "I know it is one of the most beloved scenes in television and the premise of \"what if these characters only said the word \"fuck\" in this scene\" is actually interesting but I really think it was executed badly. Basically, how many times can you say the word \"fuck\" and still communicate something that furthers the 'conversation'? I can understand, \"oh fuck\" or \"fuckin' shit...\" but the amount of times they just go back and forth saying \"fuck\" with different inflections and different tones and such, never came off as a conversation but just 2 people saying the word \"fuck\" to each other in as many different ways they can think of. Maybe if the scene had them saying \"fuck\" 2 or 3 times a piece as they discover new things about the crime scene but saying \"fuck\" 14, 15 times to each other just seemed really hackey and like a scene a sophomore film major would think up.

Specific example, the score was 2-1 in favor of us and we were on defense and we picked meeting room and lost so I suggested a different bomb site the following round and our Smoke didn't want to change but it got picked anyway and then TKed me and gassed the hostage saying quote \"LMFAO YOU GUYS ARE TRASH AND I JUST GASSED A FURRY\" am I the only one experiencing this ridiculous toxicity or what because I feel normal casuals aren't ever this toxic.",
    "Seriously, people are either too fucking stupid to realize the character on a show is fake but the person playing that character is real. It's just pretend. The person is playing make believe in front of a camera to earn their check. If the character is a bad piece of shit then hate the character, hate what happens in the movie but when it's over let the hate go. Acting is a job. People apply for the job to make money.  They're not playing the character because they agree with the characters actions or attitude, it's just money for them and the better they are at their job the more money they can make on other jobs. Wishing death on the real person is 50 shades of fucked up. If you're that triggered about a fictional character then write a fanfic about beating the shit out of them and move on. Same goes for voice actors. It's just a job to them so don't blame them for wanting to get paid. Someone has to play the asshole roles in a story and chances are you're going to hate them. That doesn't give you the right to harass them to the point they go into hiding to save their sanity or hire people to physically attack them.",

Couldn’t possibly imagine being prepared for a ton of people trying to play and having your server situation figured out beforehand so you don’t look as incompetent as every other crap gaming company in existence today.

    "I think James knows deep down inside he's an amateur film maker at best so it's no secret that any time he's been offered something like a cameo appearance in a movie or has said he wouldn't have time to film a motion picture movie it's because deep down inside he knows he's only best at making youtube videos. But he would always say he had big ambitions for what he wanted to do outside of Cinemassacre but always stop short by saying he has no time for it. Even though he did the AVGN movie I think he would've at least tried to film it with kids in his life because he set out to do the movie with the intent of getting big exposure from already being famous from AVGN. It explains why since then he's made excuses of not having time due to kids because he won't admit he was full of shit all along about being able to progress to much bigger projects than anything involving Cinemassacre. Also he could be shy about getting big time recognition from being a film maker so that's where the excuses come from in my opinion.",

    "I’ve been having these breakdowns since around last year and they’re getting more and more frequent and worse and worse. Lately they’re becoming full on panic attacks and I had a really really bad one yesterday. Cutting has seems to lessen their blow, but I’m going deeper and deeper every time I do it. I’ve gone from doing it for the distracting pain to doing it to see blood. I can feel my control of this slipping away, I get small hits when I see large amounts of blood and I know it’s fucked. I can’t keep doing this but I can’t not do it, it’s the only thing I’ve tried that works in staving away these breakdowns, and I’m scared because although I thought it was all behind me I had reallly really bad thoughts yesterday about suicide.

    "Code of the Commander is all about basically creating a massive barrier/wall that extends from your shield. In my opinion it is supposed at act similar to middle tree arcstrider, but it has a much bigger size and doesn’t reflect. It is already an underused super in pvp and allowing it to block stuff like the revenant super would not change how much power it has in pve. I wouldn’t even care if it wouldn’t give ursa furiosa energy because I am helping my team. It just doesn’t seem right that I have a super that is supposed to be defensive and block stuff like other supers from my allies, but I can’t stop the revenant super from going through my shield. It’s not like an arc staff would just stick part of its staff through my shield and kill me, so why can revenant go through my shield, especially with how insane the super is already?",
    "So I've recently finished The Betrayal of Jimmy and played halfway through Jimmy's Vendetta. The missions are actually awful and some are even ripoffs of the main storyline, the Chinese restaurant shooting for example. Also what does it mean that they are in an alternate timeline? Why does the Mafia universe have different timelines? There also isn't any real lore, which was the strength of the main campaign. Instead we got a few scenes and a character we know very little about and isn't even connected to anything in the main story. The only positive thing to say is that you can explore the open world after the campaign is finished, which is one of my few points of criticism in the main storyline. How can those DLCs be so bad and boring. Should I even try to continue or should I cancel playing them? Also what about Joe's Adventures? Is it also worth playing, or is it as bad as the Jimmy DLCs?",

Please, no low baller’s. I’m not looking to get rich off this car mainly looking for it a great home. I’m wanting to sell it because I have a family now and would like to see someone else law get as much enjoyment as I have out of it. Car has been garaged and continues to be garage kept. I’ve had the car since 2001 and used as a daily driver until 2008. AC doesn’t work but I had it fixed the year before last. It’s either the compressor or the Freon leaked out. I have a brand new air compressor still in the box that goes with it along with 2 new belts. I have a Rodney Dickman window kit with motors that needs installed. Electric windows still work I was just looking at installing Rodney’s to make the windows faster. I also have an extra rack and pinion that needs cleaned up and I have the Rodney Dickman replacement bushing to go with it.

    "So I'm 18 and I've been experiencing this for several years, as a side note l am already diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and mild OCD which I'm on meds for. So sometimes when I'm alone l imagine these things, usually dead bodies or bugs eating their way into my skin, and l don't actually see it but its feels like its there all the way up until l actually look or touch the area. Logically l know I'm find and their is nothing there but it feels so real I'm half convinced that when l touch my leg ill find flesh missing or when l look down ill be standing on a bed of flesh and teeth. And its almost like l can physically feel it too, like its almost there enough to be real but just not quite. Tonight it got so bad l was crying and l needed to call my boyfriend to calm me down. The only thing is l don't actually see or feel anything, l just feel like l do. Is this normal and I'm just more sensitive to it? Am l hallucinating? Or is it something else? I'm sometimes scared to leave my room because when I'm curled up in bed is sometimes the only time l feel safe from this. It hasn't always been this bad but recently its gotten much worse.",
    "I recently started SHing and I am someone who goes fully in without hesitation. I told my boyfriend about my cuts because I knew he’d see them eventually anyway. I have such an impulse to sh right now and I’m trying to do everything I can not too, for the first time I left the house, went skating to clear my head and got a bottle of wine, but the thoughts are still there. He told me to call him whenever I feel this way and I’m trying to do that. I don’t want to put the pressure on him though and for him to think I’m crazy. I’m trying to stop but sometimes I just can’t. Please give any advice at all. I love him so much but I don’t want him to be taking care of me in this way. I just need help but I don’t wanna talk about the things that are making me sh because opening that box will just be insane. I am simply coming on here in hopes to have some help from people who understand. I send love to everyone who sees this.",
    "So I'm kind of a sad person but I like to joke around. I am a supervisor at work and I like everyone I work with. Recently I've felt a connection with someone who is just a team member and I've tried to push it away and deny it but I cant help but feel like she might reciprocate and I want to shoot my shot. I have thoroughly prepared myself for rejection so I'll fully understand if she says no in fact im almost so certain that will be her answer that I feel like I shouldn't even say anything at all and just let the feelings run their course. A couple people have told me it would be okay as long as I remained professional at work which duh it's not that hard but then again I've never dealt with a situation like this. I just figured I'd try one more demographic before I go in guns balzing. Am I in over my head?",
    "When I eat something that triggers me I generally start getting a headache in the middle of the night. I'll get up and take famotidine or or some other H2 blocker, but that's not always enough to control it. Then by the morning I'm feeling queasy and my headache is much worse. Then I'll get diarrhea and start vomiting and feel so bad that all I can do is lie in bed and drag myself to the bathroom to vomit. Sometimes I'm so depleted after vomiting that all I can do is lie on the bathroom floor for 10 mins or so before I can make it back to bed. Once I start vomiting I can't take anything or even drink water often until evening. But if there were something I could take when I first felt it coming on that would be really helpful. Has anyone tried charcoal or bentonite clay?",
    "Mydad lives an hour and a half away from me and just went on palliative care this week. He has a number of ailments, and his latest hospitalization did not go well. Still, he was approved for a home nurse through Medicare only twice a week. Today his condition severely worsened and my mom tried to call the hospital to figure out what to do. She was told that his healthcare team has to determine if he needs to go to the hospital and that she will get a call from a nurse in an hour or so. My dad is suddenly super incoherent, somewhat combative, and it just sucks that trying to get him help in a timely manner means it won’t be covered. I hate this, just sitting here waiting to hear news. I hate healthcare in the US.",
    "We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Matt. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",
    "I’m serving in the military and the work cycle I have is staying in camp for a week and then having one week off. The country I live in requires all males to undergo mandatory military conscription for two years and I’m slightly more than one year into the military service. At this point I’m so sick of this mundane lifestyle in camp because I’m doing guard duty most of the time. I can sleep well at home during the one week off because I’m free from the military. However, every night before I have to enter the camp for work I just can’t fall asleep. I would only sleep for a maximum of four-five hours and on a bad night I don’t sleep at all. I have a few sleepless nights in camp as well. I do not know the exact reason what’s keeping me awake, but I suspect it’s because of the lack of enthusiasm I have for the military as it is just too boring. I’m only entering university next year so there’s absolutely no goalsto pursue during this period of time. I feel like I’m just wasting my life away now. I just want to sleep but I just hate my life in the military as there’s nothing to look forward to the next day and this keeps me from falling asleep.",
    "I'm posting this through the account I browse porn on because I don't have the fucking guts to post this with my main account. I got blackout drunk last night. I did deplorable disgusting things that I can never fix. I sexually harassed someone. I was the last person I expected to do this. What fucking use are all of my principles and what fucking good is my conscience if I just abandon all of it and do the one fucking thing I hate once I lose my senses. What does that say about me as a person? I didn't know I had it in me. The girl was a friend and that's all I saw her as but at the end of the day I did what I did anyway didn't I. I might have just flushed my life down a fucking toilet. I'm never touching alcohol again. I can't sleep. I tried to choke myself with a belt. It doesn't work. I might try again. I don't deserve to live. My parents didn't raise a monster. I feel so disgusted with myself. I want to claw my skin off. I learnt how to tie a slip knot.

It’s gonna take a week to break all this stuff down. It’s actually pretty cool as well so I’m thinking of just leaving them up all year. I had the idea that on Thanksgiving I would put Pilgrim hats on all the bunnies, and on Christmas I will give them Santa hats. For the 4th of July I’ll give them some celebratory patriotic looking sunglasses and have them hold sparklers. For Valentine’s Day it would be the easiest for me. I’ll put grandma’s old harp on the the lawn with the bunnies. I still don’t know what I can do for Halloween but I’m open to suggestions.",
    "Whenever there is a post of AskReddit asking about women-only issues, or harrasment that women face, there is ALWAYS some asshole men in the comments who can't stand not being the center of attention for one thread. On comments about how women are constantly facing harrasment and have to constantly be alert, guys will say \"yeah well I get hit on some times too and it makes me uncomfortable so we are completely equal in this.\" I'm all for drawing attention to men's issues, it is so important that we highlight that men struggle too. But it's just so defeating to have the same exact question, always gender swapped, with the male centered one upvoted more. It feels like there can never just be a conversation on women's issues on reddit without men trying to turn it into their thing, I know that's not many of their intentions, but it's just so exhausting to not just be able to talk about those issues without men jumping in and saying their experiences are just like ours.",

While we were FaceTiming each other, one of her guy friends asked to call her and she asked me if it was ok for her to answer. I said yes because I assumed it was urgent and it was only going to be a 1 or 2 minute call. 20 minutes go by and they’re still on the phone while I’m there on FaceTime with her and she’s having a whole conversation with him. I became pretty upset over this, so I hung up the call and messaged her saying to call me when she’s done. She then proceeded to FaceTime the guy and she told me they were just doing homework together. I don’t know what to think of this. Any advice would be helpful, like is this normal or appropriate?",

Julia has no one here, all she has is Brandon and clearly she was hoping to be having fun planning the wedding with him. Now I know that being married isn't all about the wedding, I personally think people put way too much effort into a one day event. BUT I like going to weddings, I have fun, I'm excited for the people getting married. I would never sit at a wedding or be with someone when they're planning their wedding and tell them that weddings are stupid. Especially not the person I am marrying.

    "Syke. It’s terrible. First, the update is huge. I realize it’s to optimize data but it literally took all night to download on 300 mbps internet. When I finally got the one multiplayer pack downloaded, I found out I had to download another one, which took several more hours. Once I finally got into the game it seemed like matchmaking has been worsened. Either I’m getting paired with shitty teammates or I’m getting paired with sweats. I was on a 10 game losing streak of TDM despite going positive every game. After a few hours the game suddenly backed me out to the main menu and said I needed to purchase Modern Warfare to play. When I backed out to the main PS4 menu, it showed that something was downloading. When I tried to go back into the game it only shows the title loading screen, and no menu. I tried to restart the PS4 but it refuses to restart because I assume something is downloading but I can’t see what. Now it’s stuck trying to restart and I can’t do anything except unplug it which I’m afraid to do. Real nice job guys. Great work. I don’t even know what kind of constructive feedback I can offer aside from stop pushing out broken updates.",

Lately I’ve seen the news where Uber drivers get assaulted and I’m just concerned that I could be in that position and not have anything to defend myself with, but I am also scared to have any object for personal defense and have the passenger take it away from me and use it against me, since by having them in the backseat gives them a great advantage over me. That’s why I don’t carry any object of protection for fear that it could be used against me. But now I’m kinda considering. I’m not sure tbh, but I’d like to hear what you guys have. Thank you all.",

    "Now, my theory is a long wordy one, but I wanted to post it here. I've been thinking that we were Gods in this universe, which makes sense, we can summon and create units in seconds, but that isn't what this whole theory is about. I was thinking for a while about the secret and legacy units. What interested me is the fact that in battles, if a units dies, the body goes away but the weapons stay. To unlock a secret or legacy unit you need to collect their weapons. So I was wondering if the secret and legacy units are the dead brought back to life. The legacy map is even surrounded by graves. Now here's how this works and how us being a God comes in. In the tabs lore website it mentions the gods reviving blackbeard. Which means that you can revive a unit just from their weapons if they have been long dead. Now, for the next bit I'm gonna connect this to tabg. In tabg if you die once you can go through this purgatory like thing dodging objects to get back to life, if you pass the first level you come back with a curse. If you pass the second level you come back normally. So maybe the units went through this and some have been cursed.",

Oh but then was told there are no transmissions available and no ETA. Then magically was told they found one and it will be ready soon. That was 8 days ago, and still nothing. I am very seriously doubting they actually replaced it the first time. I've worked in vehicle service and warranty for 12 years and I'll assume Kia would record serial numbers for such a warranty job right? My plan is to ask for the old and new serial numbers from the first time and see if they can produce.",
    "So yesterday when I got to my class , a guy with s gun broke into the school and he was shooting around . Our teaches told us to hide from the obvious Imposter. But i got up to do my task but someone said get down cuz they were dumb . I shouted out \"I NEED TO DO MY TASKS\" as loud as possible . The Imposter have killed my teacher and have vented to my class . I hid and he killed everyone with a gun . It was my favourite kill animation so i got off the closet i hid in to see it . Then he saw me but I knew he was sus because he sucked at Imposter like who kills someone in front of crewmates? Anyways I got to principals room and called emergency meeting with his phone and called all the parents . Then I said red sus but none seem to understand my reference . I said amogus but they looked at me weird.  But the sus imposter came and we hid . The ones that didn't hide got double killed like a dumbass.  When the imposter left the room i shouted\"DEAD BODY REPORTED\" but noone seem to understand my joke . I left the room and saw the imposter go there and kill with a knife . I don't like that animation so i didn't care . Then cops came in and killed the Imposter but I said you can't kill the imposter you are a hacker and took the imposters fun because it's my fav animation as I said , and killed the cops",
    "So I am looking to replace our companies phone system and add some more functionality.  As I am sure with everyone during the past year we have had our staff routinely work from home. Even recently with somebody testing positive in the office. We are currently using Comcast business voice edge but it been a mission for some of our remote staff. Sometimes it won't load or route calls correctly.  Somebody recommended to me Ring Central and I wanted to see if anybody has any experience with it as a Firm and or if there is another recommendation I should be looking at. We currently have 5 lines but all use the main telephone number for caller ID and We have a call Que for when all of us are busy.",
    "So recently I’ve been having really bad panic attacks. Really bad. For the past two weeks. My panic attacks come in waves every year and leave. This year, it’s been horrible. Today was the worst. The past three days I’ve drank alcohol. Tonight is my first night being sober in four nights. Not that bad considering I never do that but today? The whole day I’ve felt light headed. Earlier in the day I felt it and it went away. Then it came back a few hours ago. It got so intense and I was so scared I went to my mom. I was shaking, hyperventilating, and she had to hold me. I’m 17. I’m so so scared of the hospital and dying. I drank two glasses of water and a whole bottle of sports drink. I also had a fruit cup. All that really did was make me nauseous. I feel kind of better if I don’t really think abt it. I’ve been non stop panicking, it’s getting intense. I’m also just now getting a little chest pain. Also, I went for a run for the first time in almost a year today. Idk if that’s relevant but I need help I’m so scared",
    "I plan to germinate my seeds late this month, I was gonna start them outside in my spot and then cover each one with half of a plastic bottle that has holes poked in it so they can breathe, has anyone tried this method and if so how many seeds did you lose? Apparently it's better to pot them in those biodegradable pots and leave them indoors until they grow about 6 inches then replant them. My problem with this is that I can't do it in my house and have to do it in a treehouse instead, there's a fair amount of light but not as much as a house window due to the tree cover, it has insulation and double glazed windows but the temperature still drops overnight. This makes me think that they'd maybe stand a better chance starting off outdoors.",
    "I’m going through a breakup that is very painful. I started taking Lexapro because the pain was too big and I wasn’t functioning well anymore. Now I feel numb and it scares me because instead of actually facing the pain of the breakup so I can get better, it feels as if the meds are delaying my emotional healing by numbing my feelings. Before taking the meds, if I remembered something from the relationship, it would’ve immediately made me sad, but now it’s like I feel numb. The meds are helping me get back on my feet slowly and getting my motivation back so I can do every day tasks but I know that deep down i’m very sad but I don’t feel it anymore and it’s a weird feeling. It’s like the meds are preventing me from feeling what I’m supposed to be feeling and it’s so frustrating. Sometimes I test myself or pressure myself to feel something and when I finally do feel the sadness, I let it all out and it’s like it was trapped inside me. Anyone else? Suggestions?",
    "So recently all my purchased cards vanished from the client. I believe this had something to do with unlinking my original metamask address. I did this through support after linking my hardware wallet, as nothing has been minted yet I assumed all the cards would be minted to my new address. Apparently I was wrong, support didnt answer my questions about if unlinking my old address would have any negative side effects, they just did it and closed the case. They wont reply now the cards are gone and still havent replied after I made a new support ticket. I have relinked the old address to see if that would bring them back, but nope. Some people on here suggested I try the discord but that hasnt worked either. Starting to feel like I'm up shit creek without a paddle here.",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country. Personally, I think the trans-atlantic alliance must end and we should go back into isolationism.",
    "So, I was thinking about what a potential adaptation of DDLC would look like.  Normally it’s a bad idea to adapt something that’s so heavily tied to its medium like DDLC is, but I had an idea that I thought could work.  The idea is that in the beginning, some guy downloads the game, and the normal DDLC stuff happens.  Then, Monika actually finds out a way to get out of the game and into the real world.  Maybe all the other Dokis even follow her out, idk.  Then the rest of the adaption is how the dokis and the player react and stuff.  Basically the concept is kinda like how the Sonic movie is about sonic in the real world.  At least, that’s what the marketing implies.  In actuality there’s a twist: at some point the dokis figure out they’re not actually in the real world, but are trapped in whatever new media it’s being adapted to.  And that’s about as far as I’ve gotten.  I don’t really know how it resolves, but I think it’s an interesting twist that will surprise a lot of people.  I also don’t really know what medium this would be adapted to.  What do you all think?",
    "So I’ve noticed that viewer ship is all over the place depending on when I post or what I post. I just recently had posts get around 5000-54000 views. I posted again earlier in the morning and only got about 14 views. I’m wondering if when I posts effects my views as much as even the content I’m posting. I’ve also noticed people don’t really want to know about my life they would rather watch me do impulsive things that they more or less want to do but can’t go through with like dying my hair or making things that the audiences hobbies coincide with. The steps of getting viewer ship seems very difficult but also all over the place. Some people use hashtags some don’t but still get 1000’s of views. What constitutes as the perfect time, the perfect description with hashtags or even the best content for your demographic? I’ve definitely improved my viewership since the vine era but it’s all really an equation of when and what. At some point I’m really hoping to find what it is my followers or new viewers exactly want to see but until then I am still figuring it out. Has anyone noticed what seems the best time to post or even the best hashtags to use? What content seems to do better for newer users to help boost their platforms? Maybe some people could take a look at my platform and critique what I post so I can improve. tiktok: ",
    "Probably wrong flair but okay. Personally, I think some things are wayyyy overpriced. Such as Bat-Mo-Heels , some skirts , and some halos. The Bat-Mo-Heels come out every year. I think they’re about 33k or so. But now they’re going for 40-50k+. Somebody in my server was trading 100k+ for them and I had to tell them that they were overpaying. Next is skirts. Personally, I don’t get the hype of the LTBS. Nobody really liked the original skirt, so nobody bought it. Then they updated it and took it out of game. It was 30k or something and now it’s going for 300k+. Not only that, but a lot of people still have it. Next, halos. Everybody’s gonna hate me for this, but, Halloween 2019 is kind of overpriced, and most halos are. This is just my opinion.  Isn’t a halo just a floating accessory? Or as I call it, a floating, glowing onion ring. But for a halo going for 4 million + adds and probably more halos, isn’t that just insane? Not a lot of people have it, but really, people are gonna have it and then just not trade it. Some people are just gonna use it to flex. Personally, I think most halos are a bit pricey so that’s why spring 2020 is my favorite. Anyways, I know I’m gonna get a lot of hate for this, but this is still my opinions. Have a lovely day/night and stay safe.",
    "I remember when I was younger and I had a terribly obese grandmother whose house was absolutely stocked to the gills with Slim-Fast, but she never did the diet, she kept buying the stuff hoping the simple act of buying it would make her lose weight. Sometimes I wonder if my incessant desire to buy a light phone isn't the same type of thing, trying to buy my way into a different life. I have tried using dumbed-down flip phones and putting my smartphone in grayscale mode and deleting all the social apps etc., but the more I do all those things the more I realize that my current job and life just don't allow for that type of thing. I have an online bank and that absolutely requires phone access to the app. My employer is always sending me documents and important links that I have to be able to open and manage on a daily basis. My technicians and co-workers are always sending me images and photos of things that are vital for my day-to-day work. In short, I wish more than anything I could have the kind of life that allows me to run with just a light phone, but I don't think I can pull it off. Ridesharing and grocery delivery apps are absolutely vital to us now. My apartment complex allows us to control gate access through an app etc. Would it be futile to get one?",
    "Can we all as a collective agree that huge maps ~~are bad~~ with only 1 area of interest are bad. The way their design is lacking. With only 1 point of interest if you don't get the good spawns for them then you your shit out off luck. Have fun clearing resort with gigga chads camping dark corners, and the infamous potted rats and don't get me started on woods oh god woods. If shoreline ever gets a face lift like customs just add more then just 1 area of interest and have future maps have more focus on form over function. Maybe add beach houses and touristy spots or maybe since we have a power station why not pair it with a water treatment plant with offices, a parking lot, and big silos.

    "Just something that came to me recently while thinking of the past games I've played. My first console game was My Street for the PS2, which was a fun minigame fest with games like RC Kart, Dodgeball, and Volleyball. I spent so many hours playing My Street with my brothers and even just by myself against the CPUs. And looking at the games I like now, I can say My Street has definitely influenced my preferences. I love games like Mario Party and Mario Kart, and the LittleBigPlanet series was one of my favorites to play and explore all the custom worlds other players made. So I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences with their first video game and their video game preferences.",

They moved to Alabama to our current house to live with my great uncle. He passed away without an updated will while verbally he said the house was going to my grandparents his will was made in the 1990s. We got the house probated and my grandpa ended up being the owner of the estate. My grandma told me that they had it put in their name and that they were going to make a will.

    "My friends brought up haunted house and one of then said that his younger brother got up in the middle of the night and saw a man at the end of the hall. He supposedly just stood there at the end of the hall. For what ever reason the younger brother didnt wake up his parents and just went back to sleep. He later told his mother and his mother asked to describe the man because she maybe though it was a dream. The man the younger brother described was there dead uncle who the younger brother had never seen. Once he described this the mother knew exactly who it was. It is quite creepy considering he lives next to two supposed haunted places. One being an old house with jail cellars underneath and at night you hear footsteps run up and down the stairs. The next being an beach that at a certain time of night you can here a woman who dropped her child of the rocks scream. I personally think there last 2 are bullshit and old folktales but I believe the man the the end of the hall.",

    "The article clearly states that SCP 689, \" Haunter in the dark \" or \" Statue of death \", must be observed by two D class at all times. If unobserved it will kill everyone who has ever seen it, and teleport to their location. Which begs the question, why it must be observed? From my understanding it would be easier to just keep it in a closed room, that no one would ever enter. If no observers are alive, it would have no reason to move. The article doesn't say anything about killing the nearest person or something. Is it because it has been seen by a large amount of people? That would explain why it must stay observed and inert, but from my understanding it seems like the two D class are the only people alive who has ever seen it. You could just let them die, close the door and never enter the room again.",

    "Closing on our first house next week.  We got an 80-10-10 loan to avoid PMI.  Purchase price was 640k and we put 64k down plus closing costs the got a second mortgage for 64k the primary wound up being 512k.  I think the lender was trying to avoid jumbo financing.  Anyway the mortgage is affordable for us I calculated it would be 18% of me and my fiancé gross income.  My thoughts were interest rates are going up and I didn't want to risk trying to refinance down the road to remove PMI, so with the second mortgage we can just pay that off in a few years on not worry about the risk of rates going up significantly.  I wanted to just do 20% but in my area prices have been going up 10-15% for the last 5 years and it just felt like we couldn't save faster than prices were going up.  In fact my co workers were bragging that they were making more on their house appreciation from there job so I was worried I was going to get priced out.",

But for high school my parents made me switch to another school district as their high school was one of the best in the state with lots of resources. The thing is, I would say I’m doing pretty well but the culture there is so that everyone tries so hard and it feels like everyone that I know has started their own club or community service while ranking highly in other clubs and sports and on top of that about 20 aps at the end of their senior year. I searched this up and apparently you are heavily compared to people at your high school. Right now I would say I’m on track to do the many aps but not much community service/clubs or anything to make me stand out. I know at my last school district this would already be super impressive and now that I’m already going to be a Junior I feel very lost and worried that I might’ve made a life changing mistake by switching schools.

    "I forgot to ask what grade my Hemorrhoid is and I’m not sure if I have more than one but I do know it is internal. I also have a anal fissure, I have been dealing with this probably since May 2020, I had thought it was an anal fissure and used some creams such as lidocaine, hydrocortisone, Diltiazem, lmnoop, all provided temporary relief. But recently the pain as discomfort have been increasing slightly so just recently in March I had the consultation and discovered I had internal hemorrhoid, not sure if I have multiple, and an anal fissure. I never experienced any bleeding but I did experience the other symptoms most have with hemorrhoids and fisusures. Since I have never bled before, should the procedure pain be more tolerable? Did anyone who has done this procedure have anal fissure and if so did it make it worse? Is it helpful to not eat anything few hours prior to the procedure or use an enema before? I also smoke weed daily, could that have negative effects with the healing process? Also for the pain, would Xanax be okay or harmful?

I can see the US dollar becoming worthless and these things come quicker than we realize it could happen within a year could happen within 10 years we don’t know my advice to everybody is put everything that you feel comfortable putting in the crypto currencies as you can.

When we walked towards the figure it vanished. Shortly after that I felt like I was starting to get dizzy. Felt like something was wrapping itself around me. This crazy feeling ran through my body. It drained my energy completely and I felt like I couldn’t even move. We used the spirit box and we got some crazy things. Things like get out or following you home and the spirits even called me by my name. We left there and the car ride home I don’t even remember. I did not feel like myself at all.

It even made my heart rate irregular and I would feel my heart beating out of my chest if I even walked up the stairs. Then the other day I was starting to feel better and I fucking hit the side of my head on a wall while I was turning around.

I figured we wouldn't receive any benefits because he made okay money then and was not laid off. At the time of the interview I did verbally tell my caseworker that he was not working at that moment only due to complications with covid shut down everything.

    "Two days ago I was on a party, got drunk, I also met a girl. She was drunk too, more than me. So, we talked for 30 minutes, then decided to sleep. Then we started to cuddle. We proceeded to talk about some stupid stuff, then I told her that I like her, she told me that she also likes me. And then we cuddled even more. The next day, after I got home, I asked her out. She didn't respond, and I was rethinking the cuddling part so much and I deleted the text. I was disgusted with myself cause she was drunk, I shouldn't have told her that I liked her and cuddled her. Also, I was really sad that I believed a drunk girl that she likes me. And last but not least, because I never had a girlfriend and the cuddling with the girl felt amazing, I have never experienced such feeling. Now I feel betrayed and extremely sad. In my head, I imagined that she will become my first ever girlfriend, we would kiss... Now I am just sad and have no will to do anything.",
    "I'm amazed at how incredibly illiterate the younger generations are when it comes to understanding the value of money. Sure they all say they love it and want it. But very few accept the importance of saving it for the future. It's all about RIGHT NOW and RIGHT HERE. They don't think about saving up for a down payment for a house. They don't think about saving up to buy something outright....they'd rather buy on credit and pay only the minimum due to the lenders. They don't pay off their credit card bills, instead incurring penalties and interest. This attitude \"You Only Live Once\" or \"Life is Short....Enjoy it\" is damaging to anyone's future. Schools should teach money management as early as elementary school, imo. So much that is taught in schools is useless. Money management skills will be used and developed throughout life, and it should be something that all kids should be taught.",

    "Ever since the Aquafina Sparkling commercial where they changed the pitch of the guys voice, I've noticed that Spotify ads are the absolute worst. I have no problem with TV commercials, even the insurance company ones, but Spotify ads are extremely obnoxious. Along the way we've had the guy with Mac &amp; Cheese in his mouth, the Capital One ads with the obnoxious baby voice, the ads for Spotify Premium itself, and countless other totally obnoxious ads. It seems like every Spotify ad now is something super annoying. Plus, they're all so much louder than the music, especially if I'm listening to ambient or classical, so they blast super loudly. I can't listen to quiet music for sleeping because the ads blast so loudly. I'm sure the companies that make the ads are genuinely attempting to make good ads, but I feel like Spotify purposely hand-picks the ads that are super annoying to make people upgrade to premium so they don't have to hear these terrible ads. Do you think this is possible?",
    "It sucks feeling so dependent on them. I’m on Focalin, and I just ran out and was without meds for about a week and a half. After I got a refill, I was able to write 3 papers within 3 days and put together a powerpoint presentation, do my laundry, clean my kitchen, file my taxes, and text my friends back. Said friends, my boyfriend, and my teachers gave me tons of praise all week and it feels undeserved. They don’t know that i’m actually a mess and i’m unfit to do any of it without my speed. I feel like to the outside world I’m doing a good job but on the inside i’m overwhelmed and struggling just to function. Anyone have any strategies for coping with this besides the usual chemical cocktail?",
    "I’ve been really lonely lately. I have friends who i talk to every day but not that type of lonely i guess. I really crave emotional intimacy because i’ve never experienced what it’s like. I just want to be able to lay my head on a girl’s chest and tell her about my day and all the things i’m feeling inside and have her actually give a shit. and i want to do the same for her. I just feel like I lack the ability to make a real connection with anyone. I’m only 21 but it feels like i’ll never be able to feel what that is like. I’m really introverted so i usually have a hard time around new people, most of my friends are people i went to high school with and i met them through mutual friends. I’m afraid that when i move away after graduating college I won’t be able to make any friends or get into a relationship because i never know the right things to say. my mind just goes blank when i’m around other people. i could sit there and happily listen to what people say because most of the time i genuinely do care, but i never have anything to add to a conversation which is why i’m afraid i’ll never be able to develop a real romantic relationship.",
    "I went as a fanatic materialist civ. was ploughing ahead around 3000 points in front of the the rest of the AI empires. Taken every kind of research boost I can. Colonised every planet, including L-gates. gene clinics and clone vats with growth encouraged, Hyper specialist species with all my planets being specced into industry or research, scientists assisting research from orbit etc. Only the second ranked had a machine uprising, beat it. Got a healthy boost to score because of the ridiculous amount of pops machine empires get out of thin air, then starts rapidly overtaking me in score, mainly technology, to the point where they are now a whopping 10k ahead. They are on the other side of the galaxy so I can’t get to him unless I beat my neighbours. Only they are all in defensive pacts so if I make war on one, another 2 will jump in.

    "I finally got around to giving my retriever a bath today after a month. He's been itchy these past few days and I figured a bath would help him. He's prone to itchy skin from time to time due to food allergies to environmental allergies. I used a medicated anti-itch shampoo. Just now my brother started grilling me about what I used to bathe him with to what I used to dry him with after, because he was scratching a lot. I agree, he is still scratching, but no more than he was these past few days. I felt slighted cuz I feel like he's indirectly blaming me for making the dog itchy. And today's my birthday and I chose to spend a quiet day at home relaxing and giving my dogs a bath and my day just got ruined by that. He couldn't keep his mouth shut and blame me tomorrow instead...I'm sorry if I sound petty. I just feel sad suddenly..I wanted a day where I could mentally escape and just let my stress go and he completely ruined it and made me feel bad..",
    "I do group therapy with my family because my family is screwed up especially my dad and brother and every session ends with them blaming me for something and trying to convince the therapist I'm horrible. Recently they talked about how I dont enjoy doing chores, I dont do them because i score very high in school and it's very stressful. My therapist says they need to control me more. Keep in mind this is the person that's supposed to help me. Fast forward a week I pass my learners permit test, this day is probaly the only day I've been genuinely happy in about a month, and when I come home my dad just tells me to take out the trash. I tell him \" I'm eating right now, I'll take it out when I'm done eating\" and my dad is very childish and he likes control. So of course being the lazy fat and impatient dad he is, he says \"no do it right now\" so I say \"listen, i just got my permit, you are not going to ruin this day for me.\" And he says \"take it out by 5 30\". So I take it out because I'm not lazy like him, and now I'm mad and stressed out when I should be happy. I havent been happy for like 2 months and he ruins it. Take your own trash out you imbecile. Time to wait 2 more months to be happy, who knows if he will ruin it that time too.",

    "I’m pretty high but I was thinking what I would do if I was DFV. Imagine being they guy who isn’t just creating a more fair stock market for retail investors but might actually change the way a whole country is ran and giving those with nothing something to believe in. We already know he could make millions off this stock once he chooses to sell. But where this all began has turned into something so much more than making money. He is about to bring down the most corrupt financial system in the world all because of one stock and hundreds of thousands of people believing in his DD. While none of us would blame him for selling during the MOASS I honestly believe he might like the stock so much and that he believes in everything the rest of us are standing that he might not choose to sell until after the squeeze is over. Even if he waited for the stock to level back out the price will still be around $200 which would still make him total in around $30million dollars and from everything I’ve watched and read from him he seems like the guy who would rather give those who stood behind him get the most tendies while he “settles” for a measly 30mil and being even more of a hero than he already is to all of us",

When I got up I walked over to my friends and asked how long I was there and they said about 20 mins and I was confused because I’d smoked weed before and I was perfectly fine the high was amazing but this time it was the scariest time of my life and it’s put me off.

    "Kind of following up on my earlier post. I've managed to get Mech Assault's .xiso extracted and onto my console's hdd via ftp networking but it won't boot. Am I missing something? When I try to rip it with dvd2xbox, it says it failed to get like 5 out of 90 files. I've tried ripping it twice with the same results. I don't want to keep trying to rip it or play it off the disc and contribute to burning out my disc drive. Not sure why the install isn't working. Anything obvious I'm missing? I was also wondering if anyone has actually played Mech Assault on a modded og xbox. Maybe there's just a compatibility issue with Evo x and the game.

    "Not legal advice but i was reading up on the Floyd trial and saw that the defense argued that the crowd and floyd himself were verbally insulting and that 'A reasonable officer could perceive that as a threat' and react accordingly. Ive worked in customer service most of my life and consider myself to be a reasonable person and I have NEVER used violence or force in order to calm a customer down who was being verbally abusive to me, so this defense was incredibly ridiculous to me. I am not a lawyer though so i wonder, is there a state or situation where the defense's argument could successfully be applied as a reason for using force if the 'threat' was incredibly rude and verbally abusive but were otherwise compliant with officers' demands?",
    "Seeking support is important, and sometimes when feeling lonely, the instinct is to seek attention, but that doesn't help anyone feel less lonely. Fame or notoriety don't fill that need or promote wellbeing. Romantic and sexual partners can feel good for a time, but if its not about mutual support, then that void created by dashed expectations and need to control can just cause it to fall apart or devolve into toxic co-dependency. What we need is not attention, positive or negative, just helpful support. Support that we know we can talk to someone and trust them not to use what we say against us and want us to fail, but want each other to succeed. Whether its from family, friends, a partner or a therapist, finding support is key to personal growth as a social being. Seeking support is not a given, but a learned skill that requires the right attitude and humility to accept that we might not know when, where or how to give the right kind of support or receive it right now, but we need to, also it may be different for each person, but fundamentally the same.",

My therapist just calmly asked how my weekend was as usual, and I told it was not that great and he asked if I wanted to talk about it.. I just kept quiet and uttered, why don't you ask.. he closed everything and just quietly asked \"What happened that made you feel this way?\" And I instantly opened up and told it hurt me and I know it shouldn't have because my life is more important and I was learning in therapy how to become a better person. He just asked \"Are you sad about it?\" And I replied..\"not sad, disappointed, I don't want people to go down a bad path and others don't even understand it's not okay and support it and I always be the odd one out\". He just replied saying \"shouldn't\" is a strong word you used, it's fine to feel that way, you should take your time. He was like \"Trust me, you're just 21 now, by the time you're 27, you'll be the one who will have her life under control whereas they'd not and I that's because you understand well\". He also told me I don't fit it or isolate myself because I understand people too well and people mostly don't like it. I just perked up and told, \"So what? I love being this way\" and he was like yeah, that's important. The fact that we both understand each other so well makes me so happy that I can just sit and talk to him and forget that he's my therapist and just someone who I am comfortable with.",
    "The real reason Quins game crashed an died is because, he used Eggman and the boys to get his paragon and his high level gems just to solo push on his monk.

How about this Quin.  Reroll on softcore, and actually do everything yourself.  If you really give up after this 1 crash/death you cannot call yourself a god gamer anymore.  Its bad enough that you quit POE after 1 death and didnt kill Maven and still call yourself a god gamer, but now if you quit D3 after saying you were going to get rank 1 with every set, you really cant.  Reroll on softcore and do everything yourself, or make a new monk on Hardcore and do it.  All these casual games youve been playing like bloons has really dumbed down your gamer ability and mentality.  I really enjoy the Diablo 3 streams and I know a lot of chat does too.

I know its meant to give insight on how fortunate you are in life and the blessing you have compared to other people, but for me, it always makes me feel that the pain I have built up is worthless and I shouldn't be having it in the first place. I have a perfectly loving family and they came from a place that caused them to live a lifestyle of poverty so I understand when they say these lines what they mean, but that doesn't make it hurt any less. Am I just being selfish that those words hurt me? Am I suppose to feel better when someone tells me those words and move on really quick? I hope you all understand what I mean, that's okay if you don't maybe I'm just sulking over nothing. Have a fantastic day everyone.",
    "Our relationship is already stressed, and she is going through that phase everyone goes through where if someone dares correct her or politely inform her that she is making a mistake she blows up. I’ve done everything I can, and managed to find a ten gallon. It used to be in a five gallon, and a ten gallon was all I could find for her considering I’m broke from my own gosh and she wasn’t putting any effort into it. She comes to me with her fish problems but doesn’t listen to my advice when she hasn’t asked for it in regards to her fish’ safety. She told me a couple minutes ago that his stomach was looking a little big, he hasnt been swimming around much any more, and he isn’t eating as much/ at all. Tomorrow morning I convinced her to put him into a smaller container for a bit so I can get a good look at him and take a picture. Any suggestions?",
    "Hey I’m abit intoxicated while writing this but not so where I’m not able too think clearly but this a dumb question I’m about too ask. I’ve been drinking kind of heavily from Friday too Monday which is today and I just had 2 beers rn with some whiskey I’m just not feeling good atm I feel abit cold maybe like I should past out and I’m breathing abit slow. I did smoke a little abit weed which is kind of bad for me cause it gives me anxiety but I’m wondering if I should go too the hospital. I’ve never been too the hospital for my drinking but I’m wondering cause I been abit of binge I could possibly have alcohol poisoning. I’m only 20 years old Male and I don’t really want too die I’ve just been stuck, upset &amp; in a mess..",
    "my best friend would always comment on my moms ass, tits, etc. he would always say how he fucks her yk the usual shit. until i came home early from playing basketball and i see my best friends car in the driveway. i go inside and it’s quiet but my moms home bc of covid. i go into her room to ask why he’s here to see my childhood best friend fucking my mom. she hurried for her clothes and that’s when i saw his dick. it had to have been at least 9 inches while i’m only 3 inches. while my moms rushing for clothes he tells her to stop and that he wants to see what’s in my pants. my mom didn’t say anything and neither did i do he came over and choked me against the wall and dropped my pants. he made my own mom take a picture or our dicks next to each other and then told me he wants to keep fuckign my mom. obviously i said no and we were going back and forth until he just holds me down and ties me up with bedsheets. he forced me to watch him fuck my own mom. she loves every part of it and was so surprised to see how much bigger his dick was",
    "I started self harm from 6th grade. It got to a point where even if a tiny problem would arise in my life, I would turn towards my razor. It was my guilty pleasure and it turned into an addiction. I couldn't function at that point without this. Fast forward a few years later, and I'm trying to give up my addiction. It isnt easy and 4 to 5 months pass and I get stressed to a point that I cannot handle it and I relapse. I've been thinking that whenever this happens, I look towards my razor, but should I instead go for Vaping? I know my parents will never allow it because I live in a society where mental health is disregarded and mental disorders are not real. But still, if I were to ever get my hands on a vape, should I? I get stressed like that once every 4 5 months so I will not be smoking constantly. However I will still have an exit ready for me. Is it worth it?",
    "Recently I’ve been noticing that whenever I take off my watch, there’s some red splotchy spots with little scabs. I never noticed them before, but I mostly disregard it, thinking it to just be from scratching it or something. But they started getting worse, they went from being a cosmetic blemish to being painful when touched. I went to the doctor and they said it seemed to be some kind of burn, probably from my watch. But this dosnt make much sense to me, because I’ve been wearing it for 4 years no problem, and all of a sudden it just starts doing this. The watch never got hot or anything. The splotchy parts come and go, some days it’s good and some it’s bad. It’s not super tight or anything and I’ve been using the same soaps for years so I doubt it’s that. And I clean my watch once a day, with water so it’s probably not dirt. I saw a few posts on tiktock about people having the same issue, and when they go to the doctor they say the same thing, that it’s probably just from dirt or it being to tight. Im wondering if it’s exczema, but I don’t think it’s that either because from the limited knowledge I have on that stuff, there would be splotches around my whole body, not just one tiny watch sized spot on my wrist. Just wanted to see if anyone else has the same problem so I can try to fix this. My set up is a s3 lte with a fabric loop band if it helps.",
    "Not exactly sure where to post this but I thought this was a good one. I recently moved in with my good friend from high school after graduating college in May. Things are good between us, I have known him since middle school and we get along great. The rough thing is I am and have always been jealous of him. He's a tall attractive blonde guy with natural good looks and I am let's say not that. I have come to terms with not being super attractive a long time ago but it is tough to hear him talk about all the girls he rejects or gets with. He just seems happier than I am with his life, I work IT and make a sizeable salary while he works part time with no degree and takes a nap for most of the day. He just seems better than me at all of our shared hobbies. I don't want these feelings to ruin our friendship because he is a good friend but I find myself getting more annoyed at it after moving in. Any advice?",
    "Recently, I thought that 5 APs, 2 junior year and 3 senior year, and a lot of honors would be good enough for a selective college, but when I realized that our school offers like 18 AP courses, I realized that I could be screwed with such a small amount of AP courses compared to my peers. That's why I thought that I could take AP stats over the summer of Junior year at Johns Hopkins CTY to give me one more course. However, I realized that I'm also gonna be pretty busy this year with writing my essays and retaking my SAT, but at the same time, another AP might help, I don't know for sure. I think that if I'm really desperate for an AP course over summer, I could manage it but my days would be super busy. Do you think that I should take an AP course over summer?",
    "I remember back in a day i struggled to play this game, always got my ass kicked if I had a random party with random skills, but I realized that bows are the only option and shortly after I started building party members with archery skill and finally started blasting everyone. Since then it is always my tactic to create party where everyone have a archery skill. But it raises the question if that is the right way to play the game. Everytime I try melee it doesn't seem worth it or magic at the beginning isn't that useful. Am I missing something? Also I struggle to understand if the game should be played in real time or turn based, it seems both have different tactic and advantages but it is weird to have both",
    "My girlfriend out of the blue told me that doesn’t want to do anything remotely sexual when i asked her why she’s feeling this way and if anything has happened she told me that she regrets everything we’ve done together, we still talk normal and everything is fine but she just doesn’t go into detail about it and i’m starting to wonder if she thinks i’m taking advantage of her or something, i’ve reassured her many times but for the last like 6 weeks she just is reluctant to touch me or even cuddle sometimes or anything and we don’t really see each other often so I really have no idea what’s going on, do any guys have any possible explanations? or tips about what I should do? Is this something I need to be worried about more?",
    "i never get to have a conversation with my mom anymore cause she doesn’t have time for me. i’m grateful for all the other things she does like occasionally taking me shopping and giving me money if i hang out with my friends but other than that she doesn’t talk to me much. she does mlm’s so she’s either doing a livestream or at an event or at dinner with her friends and i feel so worthless to her. even when we’re at home together, she’s always on her phone and she won’t pay me any attention when i try to speak to her. and i asked her if she would schedule me a therapy appointment three months ago. she still hasn’t. i haven’t talked to my therapist in three months. she won’t even make me a hair cut appointment either which i do need. i’m just tired of it",
    "I’m wondering if anyone else thinks thinks like this, or if I’m just crazy. This is how I’ve learned to think about reality. It does lead to a little anxiety, but it does keep me hyper focused on stringing together good times. There is no present, or at least, time is moving too fast for your human eye to perceive. Once the light hits it and you realize something, it’s already gone. We’re simply stringing together perceptions of what has been. Best thing to do is always be building a better future so you can live with the past you’ve made for yourself. Try to spend the least amount of time possible in the past. Don’t hit a memory too hard or you will infect it with the present. Look for information, nostalgia, hope - but don’t intensely look at a memory too long or you will infect it with the present. Just glance at it. Once you’ve learned all you can from the past, do not go back to that point in time again to look for more information. You will infect it with your desires and you will change it. And most importantly, do not allow the other jerk-off in your head to dwell on the past or it will infect your future. Best of luck.",
    "if I got just a little bit horny, like not 100% or 80% percent just a tiny bit like let's say 10%. That would be enough to alert the scanner of something in my pants. Then I'll have to go through the scanner like 2 times and then have to wait for someone to pat me down, which the whole process took like 10 minutes. Usually out of anger or frustration my boner would go away and I would be clear to go. But when those days would happened, my manager would ask me why I was late and the only thing I could say was, TSA. Like I couldn't tell her why I took a long time cause the conversation would have been akward. I'm like 3 inches soft so it would usually be no big deal but like c'mon bro, I wish we could have some tags or something that's says, \"Big Dick\" let him through, \"He is no threat\" Lol, but thank God that I am a grower and not a shower cause imagine guys who are showers and go through TSA everyday.

I’ve been using the SHIT out of snapheap and multipass lately and a big reason I really really like them other than the fact that the actual kHz plugins are outstanding is the snap heap/multipass environment.

    "I am an Azir main in silver, but I’ve only played about 6 ranked games because I just cannot handle it. I know I have a high ego and while I can’t really seem to shake it, I expect this is a problem outside of league as this occurs with school and sports, just not to the same extent. During ranked games, I focus very hard and just don’t understand some of my teammates decisions. Sometimes it’s a Lucian sitting back and farming against a Vayne, making 0 plays or trades even when they have matchup advantage. Or I will watch a Nasus try and run down a Teemo every time he gets to lane. I just get so frustrated that I can’t control my teammates and cannot micromanage their decisions in lane and when they rotate for objectives. How can I get past this and just ignore them?",
    "We broke up a week ago because she started the most ridiculous ballistic argument out of nowhere and I finally had enough with being blown up on and listening to blatant lies about what I’m doing to make me seem like the villain and I blocked her on most of my socials. I noticed on Twitter though she seems to be liking and retweeting self love posts about not bothering to waste energy on trashy people who don’t treat her right or appreciate her and I’m wondering how can she possibly see that as reality after everything she put me through and lied about? Is this evidence that I’m already dead to her and she self righteously moved on from me like I was so awful?? It really makes me want to reach out and just fix things or just have her talk to me to figure out how she can think and act like this",
    "For a little over a month now, I’ve had these pressure/headaches on the left side of my head only. The pressure moves. Sometimes it is below my eye, sometimes in my upper jaw/cheek, sometimes below my eyebrow, on my eyebrow, temple, behind the ear, above the ear, and on the side of my head. When it first started, I saw my doctor and he said he saw fluid in my ear, which meant infection, and gave me an antibiotic. It didn’t help. He said it is allergy related and told me to take allergy meds, so I’ve also been doing a nasal spray and allergy med every day. Allegra until I ran out, now just an Amazon generic 10 mg. I went back, and he ordered a CT scan. He said CT scan showed “thickening” of the sinuses behind my eye and prescribed Amitriptyline, which has done nothing but make my heart race. I can’t even find anything online about that med and sinuses. This has been more than a month, the pain isn’t more than a 2-4 on the pain scale, but it’s exhausting. The only other allergy symptoms I have are drainage and sneezing. Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do to relieve it if so?",
    "So there was this guy I liked. He used to snap me every day with face pics and i thought he liked me or something idk, so I froze up and started acting weird around him for a few months. I avoided eye contact, started to ignore him and all because I was scared for my feelings towards him. I think I pushed him away. Now whenever he sees me, he avoids eye contact and stares at his phone. I have social anxiety and low self esteem. I hate how I look. So I thought there was no way he could like me so I avoided him. The thing is, all the popular people go up and talk to me in school so I can’t be that ugly where people avoid me or get shy around me. But this one guy is acting so cold around me recently and I don’t know what to do. I tried acting confident and outgoing around him but he won’t look at me anymore. Does he think I am ugly, weird? Or something? He is ignoring my snaps, avoiding eye contact and I know he has a lot of friends but acts SILENT around me. Did I mess up?",
    "So long story short, I, like many other Redditors, want a relationship. I’ve been trying to get a girlfriend for almost 2 years now. I’ve tried with 4  girls and it always went the same way. I’d talk to them for about 4-8 months and then they would either slowly become less respondent and eventually drop me or just drop me for no reason. I don’t think that I’m doing anything wrong but in the 2 years of trying all I got out of my efforts was a high five and depression. Everyone around me is either in a relationship or had at least been in one so I feel like I’m missing out. I’m at a crossroads right now. Do I either keep trying to get a girlfriend which I know most likely won’t ever happen and continue to get more depressed or do I stop trying to get a girlfriend and stick with the level of depression I have now because it’s not going away no matter what I do?",
    "I just recently passed my comprehensive exams. During the oral exam, one professor was really hammering me on phenotypic plasticity. Eventually, it became clear that the message he was trying to impart on me was that, although adaptation and plasticity are often discussed as distinctly different things, they are actually no different. To be clear, we're talking about plasticity as one genotype having the ability to produce multiple phenotypes. As this was in the middle of getting grilled by my committee for 2.5 hours I wasn't able to fully think about this argument.  Perhaps there is a difference if phenotypic plasticity results from a chance mutation not resulting from natural selection. What do you think? Do you see a difference between these terms?",
    "Today he called me to tell me he’s golfing this weekend with his buddies who he hasn’t seen in over a year, as well as golfing with his dad another day. He loves golf and hasn’t golfed this season so I know he’s excited. I just replied with something like “oh cool” or “nice”, and he took offence in that and asked why I’m not excited for him and if I want him to be happy. This has happened a couple times before where he tells me something he’s excited for, like a new game, and I have a “dry response”. I got annoyed when he asked if I want him to be happy because wtf? Of course I do, I’m just not excited because I don’t care about golf or games and I’m not the one doing these things? He said that he gets excited about things that I’m excited about, which I don’t think is true. Am I being rude by not getting excited for him and having a dry response?",
    "I’m supposed to get off in a month. I haven’t had any violations, and no fail tests or anything, I’ve met all of my requirements. However, I was diagnosed with Covid and couldn’t test for about a month. I have said things to my PO in our emails about me getting off soon over the last couple weeks and she doesn’t even acknowledge it. I’m just wondering if there is any way she can try to extend it from me having Covid and not being on testing for a little while? She hardly ever responds to my emails, never calls me back, and my last three check ins were over the phone and she didn’t answer, so I left her messages with updates, as instructed. She’s really terrible about being in contact with me. I guess I’m just worried with it getting so close that something will go wrong last minute.",
    "Basically when I met this great guy that I clicked with, I was at my lowest. So low that I ended up hospitalized. Him and I got very close and he was there for me while I was in the hospital and going through treatment. He said he liked me a lot and would never want to lose me. However, when I got better, I tried to initiate a relationship. The two of us had sex but that’s about as far as it went. It took a lot for me to open up and be naked around someone after everything that I went through with my ED. I just feel gross in my body. I am recovered right now and him and I still talk but he never wanted to progress the relationship. We talk everyday and are still very close, but something is holding him back. I feel like he doesn’t want me because he knows how broken I am, he’s seen me at my worst and he doesn’t want to be with someone like me. I can’t help but hate myself for letting him see me go through treatment, I feel like that made him look at me through a different light. He keeps telling me to focus on myself and recovery, and that I can’t love someone else if I don’t love myself first. Well I’m sorry but I don’t think I’ll ever love myself, especially now when I’m recovered and don’t feel comfortable in my body. I don’t know, I just feel rejected and I feel like my ED ruined a possible relationship. He might like me enough as a friend but after seeing me suffer through this mental illness, he probably just wants to be with a normal girl and doesn’t want to hurt me by telling me the truth.",
    "I'm testing out methods using the Gemini capsule which will help during a full lunar landing. I built an analogue to the Saturn 1 which is used for lunar flybys, this is where my issue comes in. I did a test run of the Saturn 1 and re-entered from about 50000km, the Lunar heatshield for gemini exploded almost instantly. It's ridiculous, even the capsule itself survives longer without the heatshield. I tried different periapsis, 80km, 60km, 70km, and they all had the same result. Really throws a spanner in the works if my moon rocket which I've heavily invested into can't even survive reentry. Only thing I can think of is editing the part in the game files but I have no idea what value to use, or how to do it.",
    "How does anyone deal with going to the dentist? Or brushing their teeth on the side where they feel the TN? Or is that not an issue? The pain has slowly increased over the last few months and I find myself brushing less and less on the side where I experience the TN. I know that probably doesn’t help, but I don’t know what to do. I used a floss pick to clean around my teeth yesterday thinking maybe plaque/food build up is what’s making the pain get worse but ever since I did that I’ve been in almost unbearable pain. I know I need to go to the dentist for a cleaning but I don’t think I can handle that either. I always leave in more pain/discomfort and feeling more discouraged. I know they can numb my teeth but once that wears off there’s no preparing for that pain.",
    "My mother and I live together and we buy groceries together it’s not always evenly split but close enough so we never restrict eachother from what we buy. I enjoy Walmart pickup and they’re limiting my favorite coffee creamer to in store pickup only so last time we were in there I told her I was going to put 4 in our groceries and she was like are you paying that and I was like ok fine so I bought them apart from the groceries she was paying and I told her ok these are only mine. Well fast forward today apparently she ran out and when we were in the kitchen she took one of mine and I was like oh no those are only mine remember and I put it back. She like legit went crazy screaming and crying telling me I’m horrible and how dare I not share that she didn’t raise me that way . True we’ve never said ok I bought this so don’t eat it but it’s the first time I’ve ever restricted something from her that I bought and I didn’t even know she was out I just found it rude she just grabbed it knowing I had set it aside for myself and even told her i didn’t know you were out you could’ve just asked me and I would’ve said yes and she kicked me out of her room and continued to say I’m horrible.",
    "My graduation date for my LVN course is in the beginning of May. I am in a government training program that was supposed to only be one year but actually took 3 years from me. It’s a free program that pays you a stiffen for food or whatever you need. But because of their staffing there have been multiple teachers that have quit or got fired as well as multiple DON’s that have been fired, and because of this they say there’s no way to get me a transcript of all my grades because they don’t have those records. It makes me worry how I’m even eligible to take the NCLEX if they don’t have those type of records, but it breaks my heart to think that I will most likely never be able to be an RN because I don’t have a transcript showing my grades through all of the semesters. We have only clinicals left this month and then we’re done with school but if we get a fever or covid we are permanently dropped from the program because we can’t afford to miss one day. And after this graduating class they won’t have another. Sigh I’m just stressed about all of the above. Any advice?",

    "I'm interested in reading some of the worst you may've come across, whatever culture you're from and whichever nationality the pundit was. Like, there are the obvious ones like I once heard a Japanese commentator say \"David Pocockuuuu\" but I mean they're quite far away and all, but one of the worst I've heard might be a French commentator on Bein Sports pronouncing it \"Courtney LOVES\". No issue whatsoever with having an accent, no problem at all there, but when you're effectively transforming a name by reading it just the way your brain would spontaneously process it as a foreigner without getting a few basics in or checking with anyone beforehand, I find that amazing how lazy and unprofessional that is.

    "So in the first Hitman game we got all the basic mastery stuff. Guns, poisons, explosives, knives, the basics. Everything you need. Then in 2 they gave us loads of cool shit. Dart guns, EMPs, magic powders, crowbars, the works. So much cool shit. And fun shit too, flamingos and fish and homing cases. And I was really hoping 3 would up the ante even more in that respect, but instead all we got were a lot of reskins of the items from 1. I can't think of a single new and cool item that I'm excited to experiment with that I've gotten from Hitman 3.

    "I’ve had many ideas about a game I’d like to create including the story and combat loop however I have yet to decide how to structure the game. This game will be top down as I have no idea how to create 3D models and I’ve been wondering if it would be possible to create an interesting and fun to explore open world from this perspective. In many open world games like Zelda Breath of the Wild, it is heavily reliant on players looking at something in the distance and then deciding to travel there and explore. With a top down perspective, the player is unable to freely look around which leaves me wondering if there is a way to get the player to go somewhere and explore. As well as this, how could I incorporate verticality into a 2D game?",
    "We should compare body shape to men's height not weight. Weight is not uniform when it comes to looks. Someone who is 6'0 and a size 0 and someone who is 4'11 and a size 0 are not the same weights and it's nearly impossible for them to be. I was a size 6 and 2 at 120 pounds. Are you going to tell me men were equally attracted to me at both sizes because my weight was the same? Most men who say these weight limits would be bad at guessing women's actual weights. People compare them because women are allegedly insecure about their weight and men are insecure about their height. However, women are insecure about how their bodies look not their weight. Weight also looks different based on muscle. I don't believe a man wouldn't date someone with an hour glass figure who was skinny because they weigh 150 pounds vs 120 pounds. If the age old comparison was body shape and height that would make more sense because you can't control the proportions of your ribcage and hips. However, the idea of weight limits, even for shock value, is stupid because nearly everyone would break their weight rule if someone had the body they desired in a partner and it's nearly impossible to know someone's weight within a pound or two. You can accurately guess how tall someone is within an inch or two .",
    "Recently I noticed a bunch of legacy Firefox addons are finally available as WE on the new Firefox. So I'm looking to switch back to FF from Vivaldi.

I found a bug report on this exact issue from 12 YEARS AGO, that's still OPEN. Why??? All other browsers can do this. Even legacy FF could do this with the help of an addon that used an open-source library to achieve this. But this addon is no longer available, and I have tried literally every single addon available right now and none of them do this WITHOUT sending info to a remote server.

    "Currently stuck on the glass bead milestone hard, from what I understand you need to find around 8 submerged ruins before you get given the horrific treasure. On my last play session I managed to get like 5 submerged ruins back to back via scanning with the nautilon but now for the past 10-15 oceans, on over 10 planets I havent been able to find a single one. Just an unlucky 3 hour dry streak? Or is there something im not getting. Because from what ive seen, the scanner radius is huge, some of the ruins it found for me were over 8 minutes of travel time away and im finding it hard to believe im simply not in range to locate any. Extremely frustrating as its one of the last milestones I need and I cant really find any information on it, or submerged ruins at all on youtube or the wiki, and my only option is just a crapshoot at landing on a random planets ocean, constructing a nautilon bay, scanning, finding absolutely nothing, rinse and repeat.",
    "Hey all, arizona state here.  Currently in the process of getting a team started here for next year, and had a question about officer/leadership structure.  I know every team does it differently and the motto is whatever works, works, but I really just don't know how to divide this up, or what positions and duties are needed exactly.  Aside from subteam leads, of course, those are pretty obvious. I'm talking more about outside of that.  I read in michael S's blog post about KU's early days and they had like a program director, operations director and some other stuff but the duties of each weren't really mentioned. Any insight on this? Also about picking other officers, we have a group of about 20 interested students right now, and i'm thinking about just sending out a google form asking for everyone's experience and choosing based on who's most qualified.  Does that sound like a sound approach? Any input greatly appreciated",
    "Usually I play on PS4, but I still own my PS3 and recently installed it in the living room so my roommate and I could use it as a dvd player and we could play some old games together. However, when I wanted to let her play Journey, I found out the game disappeared from my ps3, I also cannot find it in my list of purchased games in my PS account either. The only evidence I have of ever owning the game on ps3 is a confirmation e-mail from the PS store when I bought it years ago and some trophies I earned are still listed on my profile. Has the game disappeared for anybody else? Does this have to do with PlayStation ending PS3 support? I apologize if this is not the place to ask this question, but I’m unable to contact PS support in my own country at the moment because they are “too busy”...",
    "So I've had multiple people tell me not to get a VA panel monitor. So for the heck of it, I had to see what was so bad about a VA panel monitor. So what was the result? I've used it for 3 or 4 weeks now, switching from a BenQ to an AOC curved VA panel. Firstly: \"the response times are bad\" not true. This monitor has 1ms response time, and I can put it in a mode where it makes it half a millisecond. Second thing I've heard \"VA panels have bad viewing angles\" In this case, again, that is inaccurate. If I were to look from the side of the monitor, the image quality is exactly the same. Third thing I've heard is: \"VA panels have bad ghosting\" This one has a very slight motion blur effect, but now that I'm used to it, it doesn't bother me one bit. It's s very small amount like some other monitors at higher prices have. So if someone tells you NOT to go with a VA panel, honestly, make sure a store has a good return policy and try it out. Colors look nice, image quality is VERY good, and the response time is very low.",
    "Hello folks - I am 43 with an MBA and am a Program Manager. I make a very good income but would like to slowly get to a point where I could pursue early retirement at 50. My definition of early retirement is to have flexibility in pursuing my interests. I am open to choosing a second career where I have this flexibility. I have an undergraduate degree in Engineering. I love building things. As examples I installed recessed lighting in my home, built my own theater in my home, build a backyard playset for my kids. I am wondering if pursuing something like HVAC technician or electrician or plumbing on the side can help proper a second career. Can someone advise what are meaningful second career opportunities to pursue?",
    "My daughter is 12 years old and is currently being diagnosed the dr seems quite certain. I have a lot of guilt about thinking she was just spoiled and maybe made things up to get her way. But as she got older things have gotten much worse she has sensory issues with clothing so she only wears the same few shirts and needs brand new pants once she's done wearing the ones she has on the have to be the same exact pants n they need to be bought never washed or she will not wear them. She started her period this year n refuses to use sanitary products. She now refuses to goto school her grades r awful. She has one friend she made online n when old friends reach out she doesn't know how to hold a convo with them so they stop speaking. She is always bored but I can never get an answer as to what she would like to do. She hides in her too the majority of the time. Eats the same things the same way all the time. I've noticed her moods change the most she always seems so annoyed and upset not always but majority of the time. I can't joke with her because she takes everything g the wrong way . I realize im out of my element here n don't know much about autism I've been reading alot n I hope once the diagnosis comes through there will be help for me to learn more n do the best by her. But what I'm looking for is how to talk about what autism is n that she may have it or does I just have no idea what to say.",
    "I'm currently taking a criminal justice class in college.  Because courts are on zoom, my professor gave us assignment this week to watch traffic court proceedings and write a report due in 2 weeks. Problem is, I don't know where I can find live streams of traffic court or what the schedules are or anything.  I've looked at Lake County but on their website there's just a million courtrooms and i'm just randomly clicking through.  I'd mostly be interested in Lake county or suburban cook, I know there's a traffic court in Skokie on old orchard road.  If anyone can give me a link and some of the schedules that'd be very helpful.  My professor basically just left it up to us to choose what courts to watch and didn't give us any help in tracking down links or schedules.",

He claimed we were a \"thing\" and even wanted to meet my dad, but I had some personal stuff going on like trying to get away from a toxic job which he knew. I was at work the one day on break and he messaged me saying we needed to talk about \"us\". He broke up with me and I blocked him, cause I didn't feel the need to be friends with him getting settled in a new job and what not at the time. It's been about a little over half a year and he messaged me on a dating site, he'd be up for more games of mtg like we used to play when we were dating.

    "I'm quite surprised Kyle hasn't done any segments on the Derek Chauvin Trial over the death of George Floyd. It's one of the highest profile cases in the world right now and the implications of the verdict could be drastic. We've seen what can happen when these sort of cases don't go as the public is hoping, the best known example being the 1992 LA Riots over the officers being found not guilty in the Rodney King incident. If Chauvin isn't found guilty I could see a resurrection of the protests and rioting that we saw last year which spread across the U.S. and multiple different countries. I'm not expecting in-depth analysis as Kyle isn't a lawyer or well-versed in court proceedings. But I thought he would have at least touched on it, some peripheral facts, how long the trial might last, potential outcomes.",
    "So I spent a day with my boy bestfriend and we went out and got food and spoke and we just had fun. Later when we were at his house he was being really comfortable and he cuddled me and was being different. I felt bad for liking it and wanting to take it further. It felt wrong to be like that with him so I broke up with my boyfriend. But that wasn't the only reason I broke up with him, I realized I didn't want to kiss him or anything anymore and I feel like I subconsciously moved him back to \"friend\" in my mind. And I'm 17 and realized I didn't really want such a serious relationship right now, or a relationship at all rn. So after that my boy bestfriend made a move and now he wants a relationship but I don't, but I liked it when he kissed me. So I don't know what to do",
    "So we know that Skull Island went to shit because the storm surrounding it swallowed up the Island. Since Ghidorah can create a Catagory 6 hurricane what if Ghidorah sensed that Kong wasn't obeying him so he flew over Skull Island during his destruction reign back in King Of The Monsters to destroy the ecosystem. With the winds and lightning all around it probably also destroyed the wall that the natives built. By that wall also being destroyed this could've allowed more Skull crawlers to enter in and have a buffet. Kong at first confused by the storm probably wasn't able to stop the Skull crawlers in time from all the people they've eaten but managed to save Jia from either the lightning or Skull crawlers.",
    "For a couple years now my 2009 v star 1100 was having trouble starting.  I would have to roll on the throttle slightly for it to start.  I recently found out that is a horrible thing to do on the v star.  All my research led me to find out that the tps sensor was the culprit.  To be in spec the tps sensor ohms have to be between 500 and 800.  Mine at its lowest setting was 1150.  I read multiple posts where people paid $165 for a new sensor and its was still out of spec.  The bracket that the sensor screws into is big enough to drill new holes right next to the existing ones so that the sensor can turn more and be within the proper range.  I drilled the new holes and tapped it with an M4 tap with 0.75 pitch.  It worked and the hard starting is fixed.nice to get the old girl back to normal.  I love the V star 1100 but pretty said that Yamaha made the sensor out of spec.",
    "I purchased Nordick track x32i, almost a 4K Machine, with $199 Shipping costs. The shipping team insisted they have to place the treadmill in the garage, citing COVID reasons. We had to lift heavy equipment and assemble it ourselves even though we paid hefty price for shipping. The screen and everything turned on after we assembled it in our first floor, but the belt doesn't run no matter what speed is selected. I reached out to the customer service with in a week of delivery and they were not helpful at all. They pretended they did not understand which seems to be a common problem with the treadmill and try to find excuses not to address the faulty machine. They went to extent of making me send pics of where the machine was set up claiming they won't cover it if its still in the garage, to begin with they insisted to place it there. Fortunately we had no room in the garage and we had to set up in our recreation room. I sent the pictures with a fraction of second and they disappeared on me. What kind of service is this? They start conversation with anything they can do to escape servicing you. Dont' they run tests on machines that are being delivered? Anyone with terrible experience as me?",
    "I’ve been on pain medication, specifically suboxone, for over a year to manage my chronic nerve pain from a spinal injury. Unfortunately the only way I can get my pain meds is by going to a doctor once a month and doing a drug test. The issue I’m having with this is they want me to stop taking CBD oil but CBD oil is the only thing that controls my POTS and reduces some of my other cfs symptoms. I don’t know if my body can handle tapering off opioids or if that will make me crash. I’m also just worried that I won’t be able to function as well if the pain comes back really bad. I’m disabled either way but the CBD helps me feel more normal and I really don’t want to go back to feeling awful all the time. If anyone here has ever had to go off pain meds with cfs I’d really appreciate any thoughts on the subject.",
    "After listening to the Mormon Faith Crisis Retreat series on the Mormon Stories podcast, I've realized how therapeutic it must be to talk to people who are going through a faith transition. My wife and I have had it easier than most as we are going through it together, but it feels like it would be nice to find others who are navigating this difficult path. My Googling has yielded little on city-specific gatherings or groups, but I have found some older stuff that looks pretty dormant now. We're in the DC area, but is there a resource for anyone in major cities at least to find each other? Reddit seems like the more anonymous place to be more open about it. Maybe the exmormon sub is the right sub for this, but I just don't feel quite \"out\" enough yet to post there, as weird as that may seem.",
    "I've just spent time searching and reading about these Brisbane City Council zoning rules, but the written word seems to contradict practice. Like for example, the low density residential zone regulations say that people can build as long as plot size is min 400 m2, but yet I can see there are several new builds happening on smaller plots like 344 m2 in that zone. You know those developments where they knock down one older house and then make two extremely narrow high buildings that occupy the whole subdivided half each. So, what are the rules for how narrow and what size they can be? Are the regulations available somewhere publicly? Please point me to right direction if you have any knowledge from your own experience or research.",

    "I'm slowly starting back up in the dating pool after a long term relationship and I think that probably the worst part about it is I relocated due to my job, and the city I'm in is considered one of the worst in the US for trying to find a relationship. So many reports of how the hookup culture hears vastly outweighs the dating culture. Definitely made me a bit worried, but maybe I'll get lucky. Also, aside from how bad dating apps have gotten from all of the extra features that help less and the addition of triple the pay walls for some apps, is it just me or has the landscape gotten more kinky? I mean, I look around and there are so many who mention that they have a kink. It definitely makes me a proven vanilla that much harder to find someone out there, and I'm already looking in a smaller pool of potential dates since I would love someone on the more nerdy/geeky side",
    "I just got a request to help out the child of a person I haven't talked in 18 years. This old and close friend's wife disliked me so I was already on limited contact. But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

I was one of those people that had a 90 plus hour character wiped and trust me being in the character wipe gang is not fun, i would much rather be grinding for more lvl 50 gear. The devs have only released small statements or have sent out bot sorry messages about the issue, there will be a one-off-mass restoration for the characters affected but when that will be no one knows. This restoration will only work if the gear they restore is exactly what we all had on before the wipes, just giving us random purples and golds will do all of us no good and will be like were still naked. At least cyberpunk was playable, and anthem only destroyed the system not the countless hours put into a save.

It says it will be removed from all my devices and iCloud if I do this. So that’s dumb. So I just go to turn off the Bluetooth so it doesn’t connect but then the Apple Pencil won’t work with it. How does stuff like this always get through the iOS? I swear the “it just works” thing only applies if you JUST have an iPhone.

The red sauce no longer has Japanese chilli peppers in the ingredients. The green sauce no longer has Mojo. Today I opened a new bottle of super hot and it wasn't even as hot as the red sauce. I shook the hell out of it and tried some more. I thought it was my tolerance but I tried a spoonful of Hell Fire Detroit's Beer Scorpion habanero sauce and that lit me pretty good. Perhaps that batch or bottle just lacks heat? I know GB isn't doing a private reserve anymore. Maybe the ingredient changes were to save money. I'd honestly pay more for it if it meant keeping the OG recipes. Maybe Dexter is getting tired of running the company? Maybe he is going to sell it?

    "So I was just randomly curious on what people thought about the Wolverine vs Deadpool regeneration debate as to which one is stronger. To me I always just assumed everyone thought Deadpool’s was stronger but I’ve seen a lot of people argue they’re about equal or even wolverine’s is stronger. My opinion is that Deadpool’s is functionally stronger because if I remember correctly almost every source claims that wolverine can technically be killed if his brain were damaged enough or if his spine were to somehow be severed from his head. I believe there was even a time professor Xavier himself stated this but I forgot from where. And Deadpool regularly takes off his own head. Of course, wolverine is certainly sturdier because of his skeleton, but I’m just saying fundamentally Deadpool’s should be stronger if it allows him to survive his spine being severed.",
    "The title explains most, but I'll give some more detail here. My coach has told me for some time now that I have a disconnect between my upper and lower half when swinging. He had me try a stance where my back foot was already turned and I focusing on keeping my swing linear and not rotational. It has helped a little, but I still have a disconnect and I think it's causing me to put some more air than I need to on the ball. I'm making really solid contact, but the ball is almost always caught. Ground balls are non-existent. He has always preached, \"stay inside the baseball\" and I've cut corners by pulling off the ball to get there on many pitches, I also think this is giving me more air under the ball. Last, I am struggling to meet the ball out front, I think this has a lot to do with pulling off the ball and not meeting it out in front.

Before you go off about school spending and blah blah blah, you should know what 4J has been doing this last year. They’ve been providing free lunches no questions asked, and even over long holidays they’ve been sending boxes loaded with food home for kids to have meals on days the schools are closed. Destroying the sign only means 4J has to pay to replace it and then they have less money for awesome programs like free food for disadvantaged children. You are literally stealing from children because you can’t let your dog poop on a playground. Please for the love of human decency, let the signs be and walk your dog somewhere else.",

I’ve only been here since the beginning of February but honestly the shitty scheduling and lack of work/life balance no matter how many times I bring up how I need less hours because I’m in school is just too much.

    "So this girl and I have been talking for a while and like 4 days ago, we loved eachother so much and we had a relationship. However, it's a LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP. We've talked alot on calls, facetimes and texted till 4 in the morning on many days lol. But sometimes I miss her frequently, too much and wait for her to text me many hours but I always text her first. I KNOW she loves me as we have talked about this kind of stuff for so much but in the same time she says that she's scared to hurt me and that I'd hate her. To clarify, I'd never hate her even if she cheated on me, I just can't hate her. But she says that I'm not the problem, she's scared that the distance could damage this relationship and that it would be bad for the both of us and that she really wants this to work but she's scared and thinks that she maybe couldn't fight it even though she tries frequently.

    "I’ve always wanted to be the tall sexy man that woman desire and want, but I’m clearly fucking not. I have a tall dad and brother and I have to deal with the embarrassment of being the eternal ugly duckling because I my body just had to fail on me. I’ll never want what I want most in the world just because I had to get my mom’s shitty genetics. I don’t even feel like there’s a fucking point anymore. I fucking despise my body and the limitations to desirability of sexiness that it brings. I have to go to school every day to see tall sexy men who are wanted by women and it just reminds me of the absolute worthlessness of my existence. I’ll never be the tall Prince Charming, so why should I even want to go on? My dream is destroyed and I just don’t want to try for anything anymore.",
    "Just got home from a visit with my GI doc. Wasn’t even a visit, it was more of a lecture. He canceled my GES. I’ve been waiting for it for so long. He says that he found that I am lactose intolerant and that must be what is causing my symptoms. I was on a lactose free diet and I saw no fucking difference. Lactose intolerance isn’t nausea every single moment of your life. Lactose intolerance isn’t eating and vomiting the undigested food a couple hours later. He didn’t even give a shit about how much weight I’ve lost. I was so fucking overweight before my symptoms and now I can barely get it above 105 lbs. I’m not fucking crazy. I went to that appointment so bloated that I looked pregnant. Nobody listens. My mom doesn’t care. My dads a doctor and even HE won’t listen to me. He says he doesn’t want me on gut stimulators because I’m under 18 and they cause abdominal pain. Abdominal pain? That’s my middle name at this point. My mom is calling my primary doctor now to adjust my anxiety meds because I broke down when we left that appointment. Wanna know why I’m anxious and depressed? BECAUSE OF THIS FUCKING HEALTH CONDITION. GOD DAMN IT. What the hell do I do? Do I need to say my symptoms in French since nobody seems to understand them in English? Why won’t anyone listen to me?😭",
    "I am purchasing a large $9,000 usd order of flooring from a manufacturing company on Alibaba in China and having it shipped to the US. The manufacturer arranged for Door to Door shipping and included it in the price but is now asking me to give him my business name and Tax ID, so they can clear it with customs. I am assuming they want the EIN, or my social security number, since I don’t have a business. I am actually not planning on selling this flooring. I want to use it for a house we are building. Should I not give my social security number? Is there something else I can do? I read that if I do give that to them they will put it on the outside of the box and make it visible for basically anyone to see. The order is large. It’s 5 pallets and weighs 4.3 tons.",
    "Without disclosing too much personal info, I’m in my mid twenties and I work with people with disabilities for a living. Not many with autism, but a few. I watch a lot of YouTube and read lots of articles and blogs on disabilities and disorders to try and keep myself well informed so I can help disabled/disordered people and their support teams to the best of my ability. I recently started researching autism because I felt I needed to know more than what I learned in college and wow...I am 65-70% certain I might be autistic. I feel relief and terror at the same time? What’s really freaking me out is if I am autistic I want to know for sure, however I don’t want to force it if I’m not. I had always accredited my quirks and social struggles to my alternative/religious upbringing, but all I’ve learned so far resonates so much with me.

Personally I’m more impressed when somebody is able to get all their school work done AND maintain a balanced sleep schedule I have a lot of respect for those people.

    "I’m a 23 y/o female, 5’2”, and currently weigh 141lbs. I work out 3-4 times a week and am on my feet constantly at work. I’d say I eat an overall healthy diet, cook majority of the time at home, and would describe  myself as moderately active. My concern is over the past year I have gained 10lbs and not changed any of these practices. I’ve been told the weight could be muscles or due to recently returning to school and undergoing stress but I find myself ashamed and unmotivated to continue working out and pushing myself harder. I love weights and cardio but have been finding it hard to motivate myself when I see the number on the scale going up.

    "Throwaway for obvious reasons and on mobile so, crap formatting. I was at work yesterday and my coworker mentioned that they've been noticing that some of their charts have been altered after they have already signed off on them. I went back through some of my charts and I also had some that were changed. The most concerning to me was one that mentioned a change in condition with no follow up to a provider. I can tell where I stopped charting though because I use abbreviations and the person that started charting after me spelled everything out. We suspect management are making these changes in order to fulfill insurance requirements that aren't being met. There's also nothing saying the chart was edited on our end. I'm not sure what I can do about this since there's no proof on our end that it is being changed. The other nurses don't seem as concerned as me about this, is this something that happens a lot?",
    "I realised today that we never actually got the love we deserved from our parents. I used to convince myself that “they weren’t that bad” and the love bombing stages made me think it was just “normal fighting” but it’s not. I grew up bullied as well and so neither school or home was my safe space which was the reason I read so much and threw myself into fictional worlds. Maladaptive daydreaming was my escape. It’s only recently that I have a healthy bunch of friends that I can say they’re my safe space especially since I still live with my parents but it’s a punch in the gut to think the people who are supposed to give you that unconditional healthy love that you can rely on and always come home to gave us the kind of love we have to spend the rest of our lives trying to unlearn and escape From. It’s incredibly damaging because then we tend to seek that healthy love in our romantic relationships and friendships to make up for what we never got as kids. We’re not supposed to seek it out like that it was supposed to been given to us by our parents but they never did. It’s hard to admit being unloved but that’s what it is.",

    "I see alot of posts stating that we can prevent our shares from being lent out to short sellers. Some say that we can do this by raising our sell limit to an astronomical value.  I don't see how this prevents shares from being lent.  I would assume that the shares could still be lent to short sellers but if we sold our shares, it would just force the borrower to cover immediately.  Some say to call your broker and request that your shares not be lent out. This sounds logical.  I have also seen posts that state your shares can only be lent out if you have a margin account.  I have a margin account and an IRA rollover account.  So, the shares in my IRA can't be lent, since margin is not allowed on that account?  I use Fidelity. Their website seems to indicate that you have to sign up to allow your shares to be borrowed and then you are paid half of the borrow rate. But your account balances must be greater than $100,000. So, if my account is less than $100,000, my shares aren't being lent out anyway?  Can anyone clarify all this for me?"

    "Hey fellow Spitfire players,\n\nI just wanted to rant a little about how exhausting this game can be sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I love Spitfire and I've put countless hours into it, but lately it's been getting to me.\n\nThe constant grind to level up and unlock new planes is starting to feel like a chore. I used to be excited about unlocking a new plane, but now it's just one more thing on my never-ending to-do list. And let's not even get started on the daily challenges. It's like they purposely make them difficult just to keep us hooked.\n\nI also feel like the game is getting a bit repetitive. Sure, the graphics and gameplay are top-notch, but the missions are starting to feel like a rinse-and-repeat cycle. It would be great to see some more variety in the objectives and maybe even some new maps.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the toxic player base. I've encountered my fair share of trolls and rude players, which can really put a damper on the overall experience. It's a shame that a game I enjoy so much is plagued by such negativity.\n\nBut hey, I'm not here to solely complain. Spitfire still has its amazing moments and can be incredibly fun, especially when you're flying with a good squad. I just hope the developers take note of some of these concerns and work on improving the overall experience.\n\nAnyway, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Are you also finding Spitfire to be exhausting, or am I just being too critical? Let's discuss!\n\nHappy flying,\n\n[Your Reddit username]",

    "I wholeheartedly believe that financial advice and money management should be given early on to everyone. Whether you're a young adult just starting out in the working world or a student learning about personal finance, having a solid foundation in money management is crucial. By learning early on how to save, budget, and invest wisely, we can set ourselves up for a secure financial future. It's all too common for people to struggle with financial difficulties later in life because they were never taught the basics of financial literacy when they were younger. By educating ourselves and others about money management from an early age, we can make informed decisions about our finances and avoid common pitfalls. Additionally, learning about topics such as credit, taxes, and investing early on can help us make better financial choices throughout our lives. It's never too early to start learning about finances, and the benefits can last a lifetime. So let's prioritize financial education and equip ourselves with the tools to achieve financial stability and success.",
    "I've been thinking a lot about the original vessels of the Shards lately and wanted to share my thoughts. We know that the Shards are powerful entities that were once part of a greater whole, but were shattered and scattered across the Cosmere. Each Shard has a unique intent and is held by a vessel who embodies that intent. However, I believe that the original vessels of the Shards might have been different individuals than the ones we see in the current timeline. It's possible that the original vessels were chosen by the Shards themselves, based on their suitability to embody the intent. This would explain why some of the current vessels seem to struggle with their Shard's intent, while others embrace it fully. Additionally, it's possible that the original vessels had a different understanding or interpretation of their Shard's intent, which could have influenced the way the Shard behaves in the present. Overall, I think exploring the origins of the Shards and their original vessels could provide valuable insights into the nature of the Cosmere and the motivations of these powerful entities.",

    "I recently learned that White Plains is planning to close the Galleria, and I have to say, I think it's a really stupid decision. The Galleria has been a staple in the community for years, providing a convenient and diverse shopping experience for residents and visitors alike. It's not just a mall, but a hub for socializing, entertainment, and economic growth. Closing it down would not only be a blow to the local economy, but also a loss for the community as a whole. I understand that online shopping has become more popular, but there's still something special about physically going to a mall and browsing through different stores. Plus, the Galleria offers a unique mix of stores that you can't find online. It's a place where people can gather, explore, and support local businesses. Instead of shutting it down, I believe White Plains should invest in revitalizing the Galleria and finding innovative ways to attract more visitors. Closing it would be a shortsighted decision that would have long-lasting negative effects on the community.",
    "I've been thinking a lot lately about why people do bad things. It's easy to judge someone for their actions without considering the underlying reasons behind them. We often forget that people are complex beings with their own unique experiences and circumstances that shape their behavior.\n\nOne reason behind a bad action could be a lack of empathy or understanding. Some individuals may not have the ability to put themselves in someone else's shoes and consider the consequences of their actions. This can lead to thoughtless or harmful behavior without any malicious intent.\n\nAnother reason could be a person's upbringing or environment. If someone grows up in a toxic or abusive household, they may learn unhealthy coping mechanisms or develop a distorted sense of right and wrong. It's important to remember that not everyone has had the same opportunities or support systems in life, which can greatly influence their actions.\n\nMental health issues can also play a significant role in someone's behavior. Conditions such as depression, anxiety, or personality disorders can affect a person's judgment, impulse control, and decision-making abilities. It's crucial to approach these situations with compassion and understanding, rather than simply labeling someone as \"bad.\"\n\nSocietal factors can also contribute to bad actions. In some cases, individuals may feel pressured to conform to certain norms or expectations, leading them to engage in harmful behavior. Peer pressure, societal inequalities, or a lack of resources can all influence someone's choices and actions.\n\nUltimately, it's important to remember that there are often multiple reasons behind a bad action. While it's essential to hold individuals accountable for their behavior, it's equally important to try and understand the underlying factors that may have contributed to their actions. By doing so, we can foster empathy, compassion, and potentially even help prevent future bad actions.",

Has anyone else experienced a decrease in activity on their favorite online platforms? It's strange and a bit lonely. I miss the lively discussions and interactions. Where the heck is everybody?",
    "I recently made the decision to move all of my coins from Coinbase to the Polygon L2 network, and I wanted to express my gratitude to the projects Quickswap and Moonwolf.io for making this possible. The speed and efficiency of transactions on Polygon L2 have been incredible, and I am thrilled to be part of this ecosystem. Thanks to Quickswap and Moonwolf.io, I can now enjoy lower fees and faster confirmation times for my transactions. I highly recommend others to explore the benefits of Polygon L2 and consider making the switch.",
    "I recently started playing Camp Buddy, and I have to say, it's been making me feel really down. I know it's just a game, but the characters and their stories hit close to home for me. Seeing them struggle with their own issues and insecurities reminds me of my own struggles. It's like a mirror reflecting back all the things I try to hide and ignore. I know it's important to address these feelings and work through them, but sometimes it's just overwhelming. I guess I just wanted to vent and see if anyone else has had a similar experience with this game or any other media.",
    "Hey everyone,\n\nI just had another \"lovely\" call with the IRS and thought I'd share my experience here. As we all know, dealing with the IRS can sometimes be quite an adventure, and today was no exception!\n\nI called the IRS to clarify some doubts about my tax return, expecting a smooth conversation. Little did I know what I was about to face. The call started off on the wrong foot with long hold times and repetitive elevator music that could put anyone to sleep.\n\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, I got connected to an agent who seemed to have just woken up on the wrong side of the bed. I explained my query politely, but their tone was anything but friendly. They seemed annoyed and uninterested, which made it even more frustrating for me.\n\nTrying to remain calm and patient, I persisted with my questions, hoping for clear and concise answers. Unfortunately, the agent's explanations were far from that. Their jargon-filled responses only served to confuse me further. I found myself going around in circles, desperately trying to make sense of the situation.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the call disconnected multiple times, forcing me to go through the whole hold process again. By this point, my patience was wearing thin, and my frustration was reaching new heights. It felt like a never-ending cycle of the IRS's infamous hold music and repetitive automated messages.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, I managed to get all my queries sorted, but not without a significant toll on my mental wellbeing. Dealing with the IRS is undoubtedly a unique experience, and it never ceases to amaze me how such a bureaucracy can exist in this day and age.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to vent out my IRS-induced frustration here and share my experience with you all. Feel free to share your own \"lovely\" encounters with the IRS in the comments below. We're all in this together!",
    "I turned 18 last month and it hit me hard. I suddenly realized that adulthood is creeping up on me, and it's scary. I'm sad that I'm growing up because I miss the carefree days of childhood. Everything seemed so much simpler back then. Responsibilities were minimal, and the world felt like a big playground filled with endless possibilities. Now, I have to worry about bills, career choices, and the pressures of fitting into society's expectations. It's overwhelming. Moreover, as we grow older, we start to lose touch with old friends and drift apart. It's hard to accept that the people we grew up with are now leading completely different lives. Sometimes, I wish I could go back in time and relive those carefree days, but I know that's not possible. Growing up is a natural part of life, and all we can do is embrace it and make the most out of the opportunities that come our way. However, it's okay to feel sad about it sometimes. I just hope that as I grow older, I can find the balance between embracing adulthood and keeping the childlike wonder and joy alive within me.",
    "I feel so lost and overwhelmed right now. It seems like everything in my life is falling apart and I don't know what to do anymore. My relationships are strained, my career is stagnant, and I can't seem to find any joy or motivation. I've tried different ways to improve my situation, but nothing seems to work. I feel stuck and hopeless. I could really use some advice or encouragement from others who may have been through similar situations. How did you find the strength to keep going and turn things around? Any advice or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.",
    "I recently played Six Days in Fallujah and wanted to share my thoughts on the game. I have to say, it was a truly intense and immersive experience. The game does an incredible job of capturing the chaos and uncertainty of war. The graphics and sound design are top-notch, making you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The gameplay mechanics are also well-executed, with realistic gunplay and tactical decision-making. However, I understand that the game has faced controversy due to its portrayal of real-life events. While I can see why some people may find it uncomfortable, I believe that it's important to explore and understand the complexities of war through different mediums, including video games. Overall, Six Days in Fallujah is a thought-provoking and emotionally-charged game that offers a unique perspective on the realities of war.",

I understand that having a cosigner provides additional security for the lender, but it can be challenging to find someone who is willing to cosign.

    " There was a post a day or two ago about the new \"Mining Dimension\", where people could go mine and get resources that they couldn't get in the world, by themselves. Sounds like a great idea, right? Early on in the lifecycle of a sandbox game like this, the developers want to add things that are imbalanced, to make it so there is more to do, and more ways to do it, but they don't want to just hand over the best items to players, because that would make the game too easy, and remove a lot of the challenges that make the game fun. So they added this dimension, where you can get at these resources that are otherwise difficult to get.\n\nBut, in the spirit of sandboxes, the developers also don't want to take away from the creativity of the players, and are leaving it up to the players to decide how these resources are obtained. So, in the various worlds I've been to, this is how it plays out:\n\nPlayers figure out that the new mining dimension is by far the most efficient way to get the resources they want, and they start spending most of their time there. Because it's so efficient, it becomes the only place to really get the resources, because players don't want to spend the time it would take to obtain the resources the long way. Because players are spending most of their time in this dimension, they start bringing in resources from other worlds, by spawning them in using creative mode, and selling them to players for in-game money. I've seen this happen in every single world I've been in that has the mining dimension. There is essentially no reason at all to even try to mine for resources outside of the mining dimension anymore.\n\nSo, now the mining dimension is where all the action is. Players are spending all their time there mining away, and they're getting way more resources than they could ever get on their own. These same players start getting bored with just mining, and they want a way to use up all these resources. Naturally, they start building awesome things (like a castle for their town, or a giant statue of the enderdragon). Then the developers add in a new feature where you can build stuff in the mining dimension. It makes sense, because that's where all the players are, and where all the resources are. Except now it's imbalanced again, because it's even easier to get resources and build stuff, and the challenges that make the game fun are removed.\n\n",
    " Today my panic attack decided to come while I was meditating, and it was A LOT. Like, full-blown hyperventilating, crying, couldn't move, couldn't calm down, super uncomfortable for me and everyone around me AT A YOGA CLASS. \n\nLuckily I've had quite a few before so I knew what was happening, and I knew how to try to pull myself out of it.

    " I'm gonna start this off by saying I never thought I'd be that guy. Thelynn100, you've changed me.\n\nBut seriously, I guessfedly think about things too much sometimes cause this idea just spun out of control and now I can't let it go. We have a female colleague who is extremely charming, sweet, cute, and just an all around delightful human being. Like everybody loves her and she's super popular in the office. There's a sizable group of female office workers and she is at the center of them. They do a lot of things together, go to lunch, go shopping after work, go to each others houses, etc.\n\nShe also has a very close relationship with our boss, who is married but that doesn't seem to matter much to anyone. It's not like they do anything inappropriate at work together but you can tell they have a very close relationship.\n\nNow for the juicy details:\n\nShe comes in early almost every day, around 7:45-8am. Our boss comes in around 8:30-8:45am. Today I was the only one in the office at 8am and she came in and we ended up having a nice little conversation about something. At 8:30am sharp our boss came in, said good morning to me (didn't seem weird or anything since he knows I'm always early), and then went straight to her office and closed the door. They were in there together until about 9:15am when he left and then she left about 10 minutes later.\n\nIt's not the first time I've seen them have a intimate little chat in the morning. The question is... what are they talking about??? It can't be work related,cause there's no way he doesn't see her for the rest of the day. Even if there is some work related issue he could call her on the phone or they could meet later. They always make a point to have their little morning chats when nobody else is around. It's so frustrating!!! I need to know what they're talking about!!! But if I ask her about it, it would be extremely obvious that I'm asking cause I was here when they were talking and I've never had a one on one conversation with her about anything. I could ask him but that would just be weird and obvious also.\n\nI feel like such a creep for thinking/worrying about this so much. I try to tell myself it's none of my business",
    " Netflix recently raised their prices roughly a week ago, annoyance from the customers is an understatement.

PCR's, unboxing videos, and especially trends are being recycled without the creators consent. Now this may seem like its unrelated, but hear me out.\n\nMost of these creators put their content on other platforms as well, YouTube, TikTok, etc. When Netflix uses their content, THEY GET PAID. Them putting their content on these platforms is their decision, but Netflix giving them money for their content without their consent is borderline theft. The usage of this footage falls under \"fair use\" regardless of how one feels about it, and is thereby taxable.\n\nThis is literally an April fools tax, money going straight from the customer to these random influencers without consent or notification.\n\nJust something I noticed.",
    " Many people—especially those diagnosed with ADHD—find that their attention and energy shift with changes in temperature. When it's hot, they feel more languid and have a harder time getting things done. When it's cold, they feel more alert and energetic. Try as they might, they cannot control this shift in focus.\n\nHere is the reality: focus shifting with temperature change is normal.Temperature affects all of us—those with and without ADHD. When it's hot, our bodies sweat to regulate our internal temperature. This process requires energy, making us feel tired. Conversely, when it's cold, our bodies must work harder to generate heat, which can make us feel more energized.\n\nHere's the good news: You can control the temperature in your personal space. You can't control the weather, but you can control the temperature in your home, office, and car. When you have the opportunity to choose, choose a temperature that suits your needs. Do you have difficulty focusing when it's hot? Keep your place cold. Do you become lethargic in the cold? Keep your place warm. \n\nFurthermore, you can use this knowledge to your advantage. If you know that heat makes you tired and unproductive, don't fight it. Instead, use the heat as an excuse to slow down. When it's hot outside, take a break from work. Go to a cool place and relax. Listen to some music, read a book, or do whatever else helps you unwind. When it's cold, ramp up your productivity by tackling challenging tasks. If you usually have trouble concentrating in the cold, arrange your schedule to align with your higher energy levels.",
    " Like many others, I dove into Hell Unleashed as my first new game of 2023. I've been having a blast so far, despite some frustrations. One thing that's stand out thus far though, is how disappointing the mastery unlocks are.\n\nI feel like I've been punish for leveling up my masters. Most of my skills have been replaced with generic, passive bonuses. My attack skills now do nothing, and my masteries offer no new abilities. Instead, I get a tiny damage boost every few levels and that's it. It's so boring.\n\nI feel this game would benefit immensely by allowing us to select from a choice of abilities every few levels, instead of just slapping on a generic bonus. At that point though, you might as well not even have masteries, and instead just have a selection of abilities to pick at each level up.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I missing something, or does the game need to do a better job guiding players towards interesting masteries?\n\n[Update: I've heard from the developers, and they've assured me that masteries do get more exciting later in the game. Hopefully that's true, and the rate at which you earn new skills will accelerate as the game goes on. If that's the case, this complaint mostly boils down to difficulty in attracting players to your game when it's in early access versus the long-term payoff of sticking with the game through its various stages of development.]",

    " I'm a FTM (first time mom) and I'm having some doubts about my son liking me. He's almost 14 weeks old now. Ever since he was born he's never really smiled at me. He smiles at his pacifier, the ceiling fans, the windows when the sun is up, and his bouncy seat vibrates but rarely at me or anyone else. He will track me with his eyes everywhere in the room but when I get close he turns his head and smiles at something else. He's apparently very cuddly with my husband but with me lately all he wants to do is chew on my necklace or try and bite my shoulder while I'm trying to get him to sleep. He doesn't kick his legs and smile when I talk to him like he does with my husband. He just squirms and cries. Whenever I'm trying to get him to smile or laugh he gets very fussy. When my husband tries the same things he laughs and smiles. I love my son so much already but I wanna feel like he loves me too ya know? Is this normal?! Do I just have a \"dad\" baby?!!",
    " I got married in 2022 to a non-us citizen. She had been in the US since February 2022 and we got married in September. She went back to her home country in October to visit family and unexpected events forced her to stay there until now (she is trying to come back as soon as possible but there are issues).\n\nWe filed our taxes jointly in 2022. She hadnt been making any money in the US and therefore didnt have any national insurance number. On the 1040 form, we filled out her information in the spouse section, including her ITN and country of residence.\n\nAlong with our tax return, we also filed form 8379 to claim injured spouse relief due to her not having any income and therefore any tax deductions in the US.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, we got our tax refund for 2022, which was about $1500. We were expecting a bigger refund since the main earner in the household is taxed at a much higher rate than the other, but didnt really think much of it.\n\nToday I saw on IRS Get Transcript that our 3rd stimulus check was sent to our respective banks. Mine was sent to my account correctly. However, hers was sent to an account with the same number as mine but with an extra 0 at the end of the routing number. The account number is completely different. This bank account never belonged to either of us. It looks like the refund cheque was sent there and then bounced, as the transcript says it was then sent back to the IRS.\n\nI have called the IRS several times. The first couple of times, I was on hold for over an hour and then it just disconnected. The third time, I waited on hold for about 40 minutes to speak to someone and then they answered, but then the call disconnected after 10 seconds.\n\nI have tried calling the IRS several times today and it keeps disconnecting after being on hold for too long. How can I solve this issue? Ive been trying to find some solution for hours but nothing comes up for my particular case. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\nI should mention that we filed our taxes with TurboTax. Ive reached out to them as well but havent heard back.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the replies!

    " Been on bupropion for about a week now. Today is the first day that I feel relatively normal. The urge to do things is back, and I'm able to get up and go again. I was so incredibly bored of everything before, and now I'm just excited for things again. The biggest thing that's changed, and the reason I went on it is that I just couldn't stand to be touched anymore. It made me so uncomfortable and agitated. Barely any sensation at all would make me feel too touched. Blankets were too much, and I would have to sleep naked with just one thin sheet. Touching someone else would be incredibly uncomfortable. Even just the wind blowing on me would be too much. It's crazy because I went from being such a touchy feely person who just wanted to be hugged and cuddled 24/7 to being literally unable to stand it. Anyway, I'm on 40mg right now. I might ask to go up to like 75 or 100mg next week. I know it's a pretty steep jump, but I feel like I need it. The reason I say that is because although I feel great, I don't feel... satisfied, I guess? Like I still want to harm myself. I want to cut. I have no desire to act on it, and I feel satisfied with myself for making it this far, but the urge is there still. I almost feel like I need to fill the void of touching with cutting, but that sounds ridiculous even to me. I doubt it's bupropion related because it's still working wonders for my ability to do things, but I thought I'd mention it. I hope it goes away on its own. Anyway, sorry for the novel.

    " \"Are there any guidelines on how to title/name articles, especially when there are several of them? defying articles - Grammar and Syntax - English Grammar and Syntax\"\n\nI often come across articles in edited works—namely, journals, textbooks, and dissertations—that are titled with a definite article, and yet they aren't the article that introduces the concept. Usually, the article will be introduced in a section or paragraph title, and then subsequent paragraphs will use that article as a noun, referring to the idea that was just introduced. \n\nExample:\n\n\"There is only one way to organize your closet. It is easier than you think. The trick is to take everything out, and separate items into three piles: Keep, donate, and sell. The keep pile should be further divided into two sections—items to wear, and items to store. Whereas the donate and sell piles should each be placed in a separate area.\"\n\nIn this example, \"the\" refers to the process of organizing a closet. It appears that the author is presenting a new idea—organizing a closet by removing all items and separating them into piles. If this is the case, shouldn't the article be presented as \"a\" process? For example, \"a method for organizing one's closet...\"\n\nAlso, I believe that I have seen works where the definitive article is removed from a subsequent usage. Is this in line with any style guidelines? It seems as though the author made a choice to present an idea using \"the\" article, so it would follow that the article remains \"the\" throughout the work, especially since there seems to be no semantic distinction between the first usage and any subsequent usage. \n\nIn summary, what are the guidelines for using the definitive article in titles/headings? Are subsequent references to the title required to match the article used in the title? And are there any style guidelines that address this?\"\n\nEDIT: Apparently, this phenomenon is called \"title noun\" and there are plenty of resources available online. Title noun is essentially a noun that follows a title, and it can be modified by the definitive article despite not appearing in the title itself. Seems like this is more of an editing/proofreading question. Thanks to everyone who answered!

This solves that problem. Now - set a reminder on your phone. Remind yourself to check your bank account each month around the time the bills are due. About a day or so before is fine. This way you can check that the funds are there and that the payment is about to go through. If you got the spare cash, dump it in that account as a buffer.

    " As a person who teaches calculus, calculus-based physics, and differential equations, I have three messages for my students relating to 4/16.\n\n1. When you see an expression like 4/16, you should see this as an opportunity. Most people will see $\\frac{4}{16}$ as $0.25$. But you can see that as $1-x$ for some reason. As long as you are comfortable with common denominators, you should view $\\frac{4}{16}$ as $\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{4}$, which you should be able to simplify to $0$.\n\n2. If you're still stuck on $\\frac{4}{16}$ after seeing these, you shouldn't be worried. That's a common beginner's mistake. Just like you won't always get every question on a test correct, you won't always get every calculus problem correct. You shouldn't see yourself as wrong for making mistakes. Everyone makes them. That includes me, everyone on the planet, and (probably) everyone who has ever lived. It's how you respond to your mistakes that matters.\n\n3. The above point leads to my last piece of advice. As you work through a calculus problem, it's ok (and expected) that you'll make mistakes as you go. For example, when I solve a problem, I might write $\\frac{4}{16}$ when I actually mean $\\frac{1}{4}$. I'll then later realize that I did something wrong, and be able to fix it. The important thing isn't that I made a mistake, but that I noticed the mistake and corrected it.\n\nSo relax. calculus isn't something to fear. It's something to work through. It's ok if you make mistakes. As long as you notice them and fix them, you'll be fine.",

    " Finite supply, Infinite labor\nThis economy is wild. There is a finite supply of bitcoin, but unlimited labor supplied by an army of open source developers from all over the world working on it.\n\nAn analogy would be if you could make copies of Mona Lisa and sell them as originals, with the value of an original dictated by how much the market is willing to pay for it, despite the endless supply of copies.\n\nThe bitcoin/mona lisa of this scenario is the design of the bitcoin itself, the most popular and widely used crypto. Copies are made and sold as \"original\" tokens that have some slight differences, with their value determined by the market. The difference being the talent and effort that went into designing bitcoin, vs the virtually unlimited, nearly costless supply of developers who can copy and alter the code.\n\nIn economics this is referred to as \"scarcity\" where things that are scarce are more valuable, versus things that are abundant. The intelligence and effort that went into creating a good or service is the cost of creating another, and this cost is usually high due to the creativity and expertise required. However, copies may be made nearly infinitely at near zero cost.\n\nThis is why companies place so much value on their IP and patents. Its not the patent itself that has value, its the talent and effort that went into creating what is patented.\n\nI hope that makes bitcoin/cryptocurrency a bit more understandable.",
    " After being in a funk for about 7 years with on and off depression finally deciding to take control. It started in high school with bullying and not being popular added with childhood trauma. I had my first relationship in high school that was unhealthy. Had a break up but got back together because i was insecure. Guy was a player through and through. Long story short we broke up, i was depressed, attempted suicide. But thats when i met my ex. Beautiful, smart, everything i ever wanted. We dated for 4 years, longest relationship i ever had. Broke up last year due to distance and i fell into a deeper depression. Came out of it a couple months later and realized i need to improve myself. Be more confident, social, outgoing, etc. Decided to make an appt with a psychiatrist cause i cant do this alone and need help. I cant keep living like this. Its been hard especially lately with insecurities cause i feel inadequate. Im always second guessing myself. I know its because of my lack of self esteem and confidence. Always comparing myself to others. I know its going to take time and effort to get where i want to be. I cant keep living like this hiding behind a mask pretending to be happy when i feel like im falling apart.",
    " I'm 38 and was recently diagnosed with Asperger's and ADHD. I also suffer with severe depression and anxiety. I had a PET scan recently taken of my brain, the results came back showing that the front part of my brain wasn't functioning properly. Basically, the wiring doesn't connect like it should. Luckily, I was able to get a prescription for some amazing (and expensive) CBD gummies that have really helped with the anxiety, depression and OCD symptoms. They aren't a cure all, but they have certainly made a difference. Anyway, back to my question. I am scheduled to see a specialist soon to go over the results of the PET scan, however, with all the research I've been doing - I am becoming more and more terrified. How realistic is it to think that there is some sort of treatment that can rewire the brain (through medication, light therapy, etc..) and are there any success stories out there of people who have had PET scans and have been able to regain proper brain function? cravings.jpg\n\nI'm terrified that the specialist is going to tell me there is no treatment, and that I just have to deal with it.. :(",

I awoke at 4 am with severe pain in my arm where I got the injection, and I felt feverish. I got up to take my temperature, and it was 101. I took some Tylenol and went back to bed. I awoke again at 6:30 am and my fever was 100, so I took some more Tylenol and went back to bed. I got up at 8:30 am and felt a little better, but still had significant pain in my arm.

    " Friday, April 1st, 2022 10:46 AM PDT\n\nThe Ivy League is overrated. In fact, it's probably the United States' most overrated collection of schools. There's no doubt that the Ivy League boasts some of the most prestigious universities in the world. But this isn't necessarily a good thing. It's created an illusion that the Ivy League is the best path forward for anyone seeking a top-tier education. But that's just not true. There are many other universities that offer comparable education at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe Ivy League's reputation is largely based on its history and exclusivity. But these shouldn't be the main factors considered when choosing a university. Ultimately, what matters most is the quality of education a university provides. And while the Ivy League may have been a dominant force in the past, other universities have caught up and even surpassed them in some areas.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the Ivy League has some amazing resources and connections. But that doesn't mean it's the right choice for everyone. There are plenty of other great options out there that can provide an equally excellent education. So, before you decide to attend an Ivy League school, take a step back and consider all of your options. There may be a better fit for you out there.",
    " I am a first-time dog owner, and I have a five-month-old Goldendoodle named Murray. I’ve done my best to socialize him with other dogs since he was eight weeks old, taking him to the dog park and on playdates, but recently he’s started acting aggressively toward other dogs. He’ll bark furiously at dogs passing by on walks, and while at the dog park, he’ll sometimes hear a dog and immediately start barking and lunging, and I have to leave. At doggy day care, he plays fine with the other dogs for a little while but then suddenly starts fighting with them, and the employees have to separate him. I think he’s just having fun, but the employees tell me he’s being aggressive. I’ve worked with him on “watch me” and “sit” commands, and that helps a little bit, but only sometimes. We are working on “look at that” to get him to focus on me instead of the other dogs, and that seems to be working somewhat. He’s gotten considerably worse over the past few weeks. He’s in a stage where he wants to play with other dogs, but they think he’s being aggressive. Any tips on how to improve his socialization skills and help him learn how to be around other dogs? He has plenty of doggy friends and likes to play with them, and he’s never bitten another dog or person. Thanks!",
    " I've read through the playbooks, and while I understand the merit of having interconnected abilities to reflect how the PCs may work together, I'm struggling to figure out how to actually play this game.\n\nFor instance, it says that when someone makes a move (defined as any interaction that would impact the story), they choose a playbook and a move from that playbook. But if I just say \"I'm playing the Detective,\" does that mean I can never act outside my moves? If the above is true, then between scrapes, thunderstorms, and alarms, it seems like most of the moves would be triggered during session zero and never again? Doesn't that make them pointless?\n\nFurthermore, many of the moves have conditions that must be met for the PC to react protectively. For instance, the Reporter can't actively do anything on behalf of the group until they've gotten friendly with the leads. That makes sense, but in the instance that the reporters want to _attack_ someone, it seems like they should get a move to help with that, since they're always going to be relative newbies to violence, but I can find no such move. Similarly, theHoneymaker doesn't get their protective moves until they've been publicly linked to the gang, but if I want to keep them secret, I don't get any \"be protective\" moves?\n\nCan someone more experienced with these playbooks help me understand how to actually play as one of these characters, or where to find the missing moves? It feels like the playbooks are meant to be a skeleton to build off of, in which case the above concerns don't matter because they'll be changed anyway, but I want to make sure I'm understanding this right.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: folks are correctly identifying that these are mostly anxiety-abouts-playing-correctly, and I appreciate that. I'm going to try playing again tomorrow, and see if it goes any better than my practice run did!",
    " I've been with my boyfriend for almost 10 years now and we are thinking about starting a family in the next couple of years. The thing is I'm still nervous about pregnancy. I have always been terrified of pregnancy but honestly even more so of postpartum. Everyone always talks about how hard pregnancy is and how awesome postpartum is relative to pregnancy but from what I have heard from a lot of people postpartum is pretty hard too. It seems like it would just be easier to not have kids. But then I feel like I would regret it down the line. Has anyone else felt this way? Any input would be appreciated. Guys I know you can't answer these questions but anything you want to add would be great. Best case scenario, what are the pros and cons you have found between actual pregnancy vs postpartum? \n\nEdit: thank you everyone for all of your comments! It really puts my mind at ease hearing about all of your positive postpartum experiences. In hindsight I think a lot of my fear came from the uncertainty of it all, but knowing so many people have gone through it and found the joy on the other side is really helpful. Reading about the bonding experience after birth and being able to create a deep connection with my SO through the experience gives me a lot of excitement. I made the comment below but I wanted to add here that I have since told my boyfriend about my fears and we had a great conversation about it and I am so excited to start our family :) feel free to let me know if you want me to expand on anything else or have any other questions! \n\nEdit 2: wow thank you everyone for the gold!

    " I miss seeing my parents as incapable of wrong. Even as an adult, I still thought of my parents as superheroes, as people who never fail, never make mistakes, never do wrong. A lot of this is, of course, my own perception—probably skewed by love and loyalty—but a lot of this feeling was fostered by how they spoke about other people's mistakes and flaws. Even as I got older and began to understand that no one is perfect, my parents remained as idols, as these all-powerful, never-failing beings. \n\nI hate thinking about how many times I've heard my mom gossip about someone and point out all the horrible things that person has done, repeating stories of how so-and-so did this terrible thing, and then that other person did this worse thing, and then she'd sigh and say, \"Well, at least my parents are nothing like that.\" Or, \"At least I know my kids will never turn out like that.\" Even just last week, my mom was talking about someone and mentioned that she knew this woman was a terrible person because \"she got arrested for drugs—what an idiot!\" \n\nThe worst part of it is, I know I do this too. I catch myself talking about other people with my friends, with my partner—even with my kids—and realizing that I'm doing the same thing. \"Well, at least I'm not as bad as that person,\" I'll say after rattling off a list of this person's mistakes. \"At least my kids aren't like that.\" \"At least my parents always provided for me and never left me in the care of strangers like that mom down the street.\"\n\nAnd then I'll think about my own children, how they hear every word I say, how they're always listening—even when I think they're not—and I'll feel sick. Because, more and more, I'm seeing the pattern repeated. My kids—especially my oldest, who's 10—will gossip with their friends about other kids, and point out the mistakes those other kids have made, and shake their heads, and say, \"Well, my parents would never let me do that.\" Or, \"My mom would kill me if I did that.\" Then they'll laugh and say, \"Well, my mom says that Mrs. Smith is a bad mom because she lets her kids do X, Y, and Z.\"\n\nAnd just like that, the cycle continues. That's when I feel it",
    " I'm a female programmer in my mid 20s, and I mostly hang around tech circles. I regularly get hit on by guys in the industry who want to hire me, and I'm tired of it. There's a huge double standard where women are expected to be attracted to guys just because they're successful or good at tech, and the inverse doesn't seem to happen at all. These are guys who always talk about how \"women in tech are rare,\" but they always seem to have 2-3 female engineers they're in the process of trying to hire, or who they just hired, and it feels like they're leveraging that against all of us.\n\nAnd it's not like any of these guys are attractive. They're usually fat, balding, and have bad breath. I've seen pictures of them with their wives or girlfriends and they're always a decade or two older than their partner, who is usually hot. If they were attractive, maybe I'd be flattered, but it's more of an ick factor than anything else.\n\nLike... imagine being so unattractive that you have to buy other people's affection. That's where these guys are at. They can't get girls so they buy 2-3 female programmers instead.\n\nI know this is a feminist issue, and that as a woman in tech I'm supposed to be flattered, but I'm not. The only thing that would make this acceptable is if the women they were pursuing had a choice in the matter. Either these guys are so charismatic and good at business that they can convince women who have their pick of the industry to work for them (in which case I wouldn't blame the women), or the women are being exploited and it's a form of sexual harassment.\n\nAm I the asshole here for being annoyed by this? These guys are literally exploiting their position and success as a way to buy women's affection, while the women have no choice in the matter and are just trying to succeed in a male-dominated field. It seems like it's at best disrespectful of women, and at worst is a form of sexual harassment. Am I the asshole here for calling these guys out?",

    " I really need some insight. I've been struggling with sleep for about 7 years give or take. I've always had a problem falling asleep, even as a child (bachian memory). But for the past 7 years, I've been waking up throughout the night every night. And I'm fatigued throughout the day, every day.\n\nI have no idea what's causing this but I have so many suspicions. Depression and anxiety definitely play a part, but I feel like there's some sort of physiological thing going on. I had a sleep study done about 4 years ago. I scored out as mild/moderate sleep apnea. AHI was something like 12. I went onto a CPAP machine and continued to use it for about 2 years. It helped a little but I still woke up throughout the night. I stopped wearing the machine as frequently as I should have because I was travelling a lot and it was a hassle. I've been off the machine for about a year now.\n\nI've always had a problem with nasal breathing. Over the past year, I've had a deviated septum which has been causing serious sinus issues, facial pain, and headaches. Just got that corrected last week through surgery. I feel like this has been a huge contributor to my sleep issues as I literally cannot breathe properly through my nose at all.\n\nI've always suspected melatonin supplementation to be the biggest help. It does seem to help, but I still wake up throughout the night. I tried upping the dosage but that's not seemed to have much of an effect. I feel like it's helping me get to sleep, but not keeping me asleep.\n\nThe only thing I haven't tried is addressing my sinus issues and continuing with the CPAP (which I will do). But with the surgery last week, I have a lot of inflammation and stuffiness and I feel like that's contributing to not being able to sleep.\n\nThe melatonin I take is Slow-Release Wellness Formula. I take 4mg about 30 minutes before bed. I also take magnesium and zinc glycinate throughout the day for relaxation and nerve support. I've tried 5-HTP in the past with no effect.\n\nI'm just at a loss and feeling hopeless. I'm so tired throughout the day it's affecting my work and personal life.

From what you've described, it sounds like she's not respecting your relationship enough to give you her undivided attention during quality time. It could be that she's just socially negligent, or it could be that she's interested in pursuing other opportunities. Either way, you need to have a serious talk about how you feel and what you need from the relationship in order to be happy and respected. If she is not willing to accommodate your reasonable requests, then it may be time to move on. Ostensible_Potato:\n\nMaybe this is a silly misinterpretation. Ive been stressed lately and was looking for reasons to call things off. She hasnt done anything else to upset me other than this and I feel kinda bad for even bringing it up. Maybe I should forget about it.... Option_Carbon:\n\nIf you feel comfortable, have a candid conversation with her about how you feel. Transparency and effective communication are really important for the health of a relationship. Maybe start by asking her about her own feelings and where she sees the relationship going. unusued_escape_key:\n\nYou shouldn’t feel bad for bringing things up, you should feel bad for staying in a relationship where you’re unsure of her loyalty.

The diarrhea is a bit atypical, and it may as well be irritable bowel syndrome, but it seems like there's more going on. Maybe it's all just anxiety, but these symptoms have lasted for 5+ years now, only getting slightly better with low-FODMAP diet (though the diet itself is not a cure, more like a bandaid). \n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation?

    "The idea that \" bigger means better\" is a myth perpetuated by marketers and advertisers to convince you that you need to spend more money to get a better product. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes, smaller products are just as good, if not better, than their larger counterparts.\n\nFor example, consider the iPhone 13 Pro vs. the iPhone 13. The 13 Pro is bigger and more expensive, but the 13 has a better camera and battery life. Additionally, the 13 is more compact and lightweight, making it more comfortable to use for some people.\n\nThe same can be said for other products, such as laptops. Often, smaller and thinner laptops are more expensive than their bulkier counterparts because they are more portable and have a more modern design. However, the trade-off is that they often have less battery life and fewer ports. So, it is important to consider the trade-offs before deciding which laptop is better for you.\n\nIn conclusion, bigger does not always mean better. It is important to consider the features and performance of a product before deciding that it is worth the extra cost.",

We actually got one win as humans recently by rushing 6 supply depots as fast as we could right at the start, but that resulted in a weird stalemate where the aliens didn't really have a chance to expand.\n\nI'd really appreciate any advice on human strategy for Generations, because it feels like right now the aliens just have to not be total morons to win.",

    "I (26f) have been in a relationship for 2 years with a great guy (27m). He is loving, compassionate, and kind, and makes me feel like I am the most beautiful and special person. However, he has a serious gambling problem. The first time he gambled, he won a lot of money, and seemed to forget about his previous pledges to me that he would stop after that first time because he realized it was a stupid waste of money. He has continued to gamble, losing a lot of money from our joint account. Each time, he promises it is the last time, and he tries to make it up to me, but I recently found out he continued to gamble behind my back. He always gets angry and refuses to talk about it when I bring it up. I am heartbroken as I feel that I cannot trust him anymore, and do not want to waste my time on a liar. I ended things, and am wondering if I was wrong to do so.",

He said most people don't improve by more than 5 points. Basically, I'm just wondering what you guys think. Should I focus on studying harder for the next exam and not retake, or just register for the next exam and pray for a couple more points?",

    "It was Friday, March 31, 2023, the night before my birthday. Now that I think about it, being out of town for my birthday has become a bit of a tradition; since 2019, I've spent my birthday either away or traveling home from a trip the day before. But this trip was different. As you can probably tell from the title, this trip was trying to tell me something.\n\nI had just moved to Los Angeles about ten months prior. Despite being common knowledge among my friends and family that I desperately wanted to move back to the West Coast, it was a difficult decision to make publicly and officially. See, I was born and raised on the West Coast, spending nearly the first two decades of my life there before unexpectedly (at least to me) falling in love with the South and deciding to attend college in Tennessee. Don't get me wrong, I loved living in the South, but the West Coast had always felt like home. Then, in the summer of 2022, I finally worked up the nerve to book a trip to LA to visit a friend. And, despite knowing I was only there for a few days, as soon as I landed, I felt like I was home. Like I belonged there. It was a strange, almost overwhelming feeling.\n\nWhen I flew back to Nashville a few days later, I knew that I was going to move. I just didn't know when.\n\nSo, back to that Friday night in March. I was sitting on the couch, thinking about all of the birthdays I'd spent in Nashville, and how this would likely be my last. I thought about all of the friends I'd made there, and how much I was going to miss them. But, more than anything, I felt a sense of peace about my decision. I knew that I was doing the right thing.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up and told myself that it was time. It was time to go home. So I did. I spent the next five months in LA, working remotely and exploring all over the West Coast. I felt like I was exactly where I belonged.\n\nNow, I'm back in Nashville, but I'm only here for a few more weeks. I'm trying to enjoy my time here, but I can't wait to get back to the West Coast. I know that this is where I'm meant to be.\n\nI guess that's what this trip was trying to tell me. It was trying to tell me that it was",
    "The steps that I myself took, that others took, and that I have seen work for others, if desired, in no particular order, are:\n\n1. Attained a high level of skill in a niche that can be monetized. There is no shortage of online resources (many free) to learn coding, web design, writing, marketing, and nearly any other skill. Even crypto investing and trading can be learned online and through books. The internet has made it so that anyone can learn nearly any skill at a high level without spending a dime.\n\n2. Created content centered around a monetizable skill. This can be done on a blog, on YouTube, on Instagram, on TikTok, or on Reddit. The content can be taken down at any time, so it is important to simultaneously build a subscriber base, or some way of generating recurring revenue. This can be done through newsletters, Patreon, Substack, or other services.\n\n3. Once there is an audience, whether small or large, create a product or service relevant to that audience. The product or service can be offered through the content channel, as well as on platforms like Etsy, Amazon, and Shopify.\n\n4. If creating a product is not desired, or not feasible given one's skill set, affiliate marketing can be undertaken as a near passive source of income. Information and how-to videos on affiliate marketing are abundant online.\n\n5. Create an online course. This can be done on platforms like Udemy, or independently on platforms like Teachable and Kajabi.\n\n6. If the skill permits it, offer paid consulting. If the consulting becomes desirable enough, create a group offering, creating a more scalable offering. This can then be converted into an online course, as it has already proven successful.\n\nThese steps are not exhaustive, nor are they the only way to create an income stream without formal employment.",
    "Ok so the other night me and my boyfriend were going through his notes on his phone something we normally do, snoop through each others notes and laugh at the random stuff we have written down. While going through them we came across a note with just \"providence\" written. Every time we try to ask him about it he gets upset and changes the subject so I don't know if its somebody he knows or possibly something he is planning but I'm going to be 100% honest I cant sleep at night knowing that there is a word that will cause him to get angry and defensive and I am scared. We have been together 8 years and I just cant shake this feeling that something is wrong. I don't want to snoop anymore because honestly if I knew half of what I know now while we were dating I probably wouldn't have started dating him- no judgment to anyone that snoops because honestly its addictive and you always want to know more but its starting to consume me.

    "A good strategy is to first try to break the body parts by using a weapon that matches your attack strength. For example, if you have a total attack strength of 100, you would want to use a weapon that also has an attack strength of 100. This will ensure that you are doing maximum damage to the body parts. Once you have broken the body parts, you can then start to attack the monster's head. The head usually has a lot of health, so you will need to use a lot of weapons to break it. If you have a friend who can help you, then it will be easier to break the head. Once the head is broken, the monster will die.",

    "Seven months ago, I traded in granite countertops and a top-floor view for scratched laminate and wall-to-wall carpeting. I sold my king-size bed for a full and traded in my car for a minivan. \n\nYesterday, I spent the entire day sobbing. \n\nI love my husband and kids more than life itself, but recently, I've been desperately missing my family and the friends I left behind. I'm lonely. More specifically, I'm lonely for adult connection and conversation. Back in our old state, I had a friend I saw every week; we'd chat for hours, and she'd listen to me process through all my feelings about motherhood and all the changes that come with it. \n\nI don't have that here. At all. The hardest part about moving so far away from “home” is not the physical distance from the people I love — it's the emotional distance from the people I love. I know no one here. Not a soul. Every day, I wake up and think, \"This is impossible.\" \n\nI've never been good at making friends, but this feels impossible. It's hard to meet moms when you're stuck at home with young kids, and it's hard to spontaneously meet people when you move to a new city as an adult. Most of the moms I've met since we moved have become friends with other moms they met in prenatal classes or through their kids' preschools. I don't have that. \n\nI try to remind myself there's no timeline for friendship. I wasn't born knowing the people I love most in this world, and friendships sometimes need time to grow. But when you move across the country, it feels like you've pressed the reset button and have to start from scratch. \n\nI try to remind myself there are other ways to find connection. I'm lucky to have a best friend who calls me every week and always makes time for me, even though she's in a different time zone. I have family who lives nearby and friends scattered across the country who I can count on to visit when we can travel again. \n\nBut it's not the same. It's not the day-to-day interactions with other adults where you can let your guard down and be yourself. It's not the friends who you can call to pick up your kids when your husband is out of town or the friends you can meet up with for a playdate at the park. It's not the friends who know",

I just want it all to end, to not have to experience this painful existence. \n\nI know things could get better, I know I could eventually start feeling better, but that requires me to actually wait and see how things play out, which I can't do.

We both needed a place to stay after our previous roommate decided to move back home, and since we were both studying at the time, we thought living together could be the best option.\n\nI'm a sucker for love, and I admit it. Ever since high school, I've always fallen for my best friends, and lately, I've been dropping hints here and there that I have feelings for her. I thought it was normal for us to become more than friends, but looking back at it, I don't think she feels the same way. I think I'm just her \"best guy friend\", whose always gonna be there no matter what.\n\nWhenever I try to talk about it with her, she changes the subject, or makes a dumb joke about how she's happily married to her job, and that she's too busy to find a boyfriend. It hurts every time, but I can't tell if she's doing it on purpose or if she's just that clueless.\n\nI know it's my fault for falling for her, but I can't help the way I feel. Every time she talks about her crush on some other guy, it feels like a dagger in my heart. Still, we have a great time together and we can talk about anything. I don't want to ruin our friendship, but at the same time, I don't want to keep hiding my feelings.\n\nI know that I should move out and look for another place, but the idea of not being able to see her whenever I want is unbearable.

When we go out with her friends, she barely talks to me or asks how I'm doing. It's like she forgot I'm there sometimes. When we hang out with my friends, it's more of the same. She gets bored and plays games on her phone instead. I feel like she thinks I'm not good enough for her.\n\nMaybe I'm overreacting. But these things matter to me. Idk.

    "Hey Reddit!\n\nI mostly just play multiplayer games nowadays. I used to be all about single-player titles, but they just don't hold my interest like they used to. It's maybe because I've gotten more into competing with others lately, and MP games are more skill-based and reliant on others' performances than SP games are. Recently, I've been getting my multiplayer fix primarily through battle royale games like Apex and Fortnite, and some shooter MP modes in games like Modern Warfare and Destiny 2.\n\n IMO nothing beats the intense, unpredictable, and constantly changing nature of multiplayer gaming. I'm finding it difficult to go back to linear, story-based games that are more about the journey than the actual gameplay. Heck, I wouldn't mind if a single-player game dropped you right at the final boss battle - as long as the fight itself was fun and challenging, I'd be good with that (as long as the game didn't end immediately after, of course).\n\nWith all that said, I'm curious to know if anyone else out there feels the same and mostly plays MP games nowadays too, or if most of you stick to SP games and avoid multiplayer titles like the plague. Let me know which camp you fall into, and why!\n\n(Edited: Fixed some misspellings and grammar)",
    "There are a few complex traps that can be especially dangerous for new players who may not be familiar with them. These traps are typically found in more advanced games or in certain game modes and can be very frustrating to encounter if you're not prepared. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Gravity Blocks - These blocks are similar to normal blocks, except they have a gravity field around them that pulls in nearby players. If you're not careful, you can be pulled into the block and take damage.\n\n2. Vortexes - These are circular areas on the ground that spin very quickly, causing players to be thrown into the air if they step on them. If you're in the air longer than a few seconds, you can take fall damage.\n\n3. Lava Pools - These are areas of the map that are filled with lava. If you step in the lava, you will take damage. However, some maps may have invisible platforms in the lava, so be careful when you jump.\n\n4. Spikes - These are sharp objects that can deal a lot of damage to players. They can be found in the ground, on walls, or in other objects. If you touch them, you will take damage.\n\n5. Sliding Tiles - These are tiles that move back and forth in a certain pattern. If you're not careful, you can be knocked off your feet and take fall damage.",

The gameplay is boring, as you do almost nothing besides pressing a \"scan\" button, and walking very slowly. Finally, Scott said that FNaF 4 is not a sequel to FNaF 3, but rather a sequel to the second game, which doesn't make any sense, as the plot does not continue Freelancer's story, but rather, William Afton's.

    "What happened…\n\nI met my boyfriend on Tindr. He's 25, just out of college. I'm 22 — or thereabouts. It was early Summer and we were talking to one another over FB messenger. I didn't respond right away because I found his posts annoying until he started posting all manner of things on Facebook for us to discuss. First, I talked about what a jerk I was in a comment that had 20 likes. He replied by saying that \"there are probably other girls better looking than me,\" since it turns out that the way we see it they can only have sex with their first two-way boyfriends.\n\nHe kept posting links of some pretty blonde woman and made sure to state that he could imagine meeting her, should he ever choose to do so later in life. It soon dawned on me that he wasn't interested in me romantically at that point but had clearly developed a fetish for photos of very attractive blonde women having sex (which would explain why we hadn't hooked up yet), which gave me pause. My concerns were quickly confirmed when the last thing he did before going into his room again after eating dinner was to go look on GWA. He seemed disappointed as if there was something he'd hoped to get away with here – that was not to be though! I asked if these images made him uncomfortable. He responded that he loves them himself, adding that people think they're sexy and then comments like this become inevitable in conversation.\n\nNow comes the really bad part. We've dated intermittently every few weeks off and on and have always been great friends and enjoyed each others company as long as neither of us went overboard in flirting — i.e.\"Hey babe, how about a threesome?\" No problemo; we had those. We got serious when I proposed \"We date/hookup\" every other weekend. After some time passed, I realized it still felt weird asking him out with no plan going into it, especially considering how much time was passing between our dates and I figured I wanted to know more. So, without telling anything else, I started keeping a daily log of our dating history, including sexual encounters. At the same time I started getting messages back from Tinder, saying these sites have been giving me tons of new connections over recent months (or years?) and now I might want to start seeing more guys.",
    "Hi, I'm a woman who works at a tech company and I've been working there for about 2 years now. I have a lot of friends here but I feel like I can never really be myself around them because they're all so different than me. I know that's not true, but it feels like it sometimes. I think part of this stems from how much work we do to try to fit into these groups. We spend hours on end trying to make ourselves look good by being nice or funny or whatever. It's exhausting and it makes us uncomfortable. I also think that some people just aren't comfortable with women in general. They see us as competition, which is why they tend to treat us differently.

He was just gone. The world as we know it didn't end and if you had told me that he was still alive I would have completely ignored it, because it didn't exist. I can't give myself that excuse, it doesn't make sense.\n\nAnd there's the first bit again. It doesn't make sense. We just keep going, we keep on going. The more I read, the angrier I become. The more I learn and the more I learn and the more I learn, the more I feel like I'm being controlled by some force, some power. No matter how much I read about it, the rage makes me feel alive, as if I'm experiencing something of real import. I can't get a grasp on the truth of it, it's too alien and so different from anything I've experienced.",

Don't all the people at Reddit have to go to class and work on their writing? And yeah... yeah they do for me. But seriously though I've written most of my comics (except those about The Room or The Matrix) in coffee shops around town over the course of two months.

    "Oh, please don't take this as a defense for pedophilia or homosexuality– it's just pointing out that in some circles you can be openly gay and still have friends who are into young boys (like my older brother). The people that said this post was not enough to justify his expulsion were probably looking at other posts he made. If you are upset with him being expelled, then maybe do something like block his account– but we should all be really surprised if we find out later he's still hanging around. He seems more interested in promoting LGBT issues and making money, despite what his brother says. It's very disturbing to read comments on news sites about how they should 'keep homosexuals away' from their children.",

    "\"There is so much about the subreddit which I really miss about /r/pics that I am sad that it no longer exists. I was never that involved with /r/pics - just a lurker, but it was always a welcome space. I do sometimes lurk and contribute, and I did so again recently after a friend posted a link. What caught my attention was that at least a dozen of my friends had linked that post and were expressing disappointment that the community has changed so sharply in the four to five years since I first joined. I think most of my peers were there that first day and will be there for a lot longer, and I'm glad at least some are still so active and passionate about that community. I think the community would be better off with a little less drama, but if that means keeping the community as I remember it, then I will never be able to complain about any of this.\"\n\nFor any of you interested in helping further the cause of r/funny, please read the following FAQ, which should be a helpful resource if you're interested. Thanks also to users who responded to the call for help!\n\nFAQ\n\nQ: How many friends do I need for a subreddit to be eligible for flair?\n\nA: To have your name as a default for subreddit flair, you only need three friends. (You can reach those three friends either by posting a comment somewhere or asking others to comment/thread with you). But you can have five friends who also enjoy Reddit: the three default friends/mod mail is enough; and you will need to tell us where those friends already are (in the comments).\n\nQ: Will the default picture post be updated?\n\nA: Yes. We will occasionally use default flair pictures from previous years as inspiration for new images.\n\nQ: Why is my post on default flair taken away and put on a secondary list?\n\nA: For reasons unrelated to this subreddit - you are on default. For example, if your post gets removed from default flair because it was spam, you may be asked to reply in the thread so we can verify whether your message was spam or not.\n\nQ: How can I tell if a post has been used to help r/",
    "I'm in my early 20s and I've been with my girlfriend for about 2 years now. We're both pretty much monogamous, but we have sex occasionally. She's never had an orgasm with me before, so it was kind of exciting when she told me that she wanted to try something new. So I started experimenting with oral sex on her. It wasn't too bad at first, but then she got really turned on and started getting really wet. After a while, I noticed that she didn't want to do it anymore. She said that she felt like she was losing control over herself and that she couldn't get off without me. I tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn't budge. Then one day, she came into my room and asked me if I would be okay with her having anal sex with me. I agreed because I thought it might help us both feel more comfortable with each other. Well, after a few minutes of foreplay, she starts pushing back against me and I can tell that she's enjoying this. She gets up on all fours and starts rubbing her clit as hard as she can. I start thrusting my hips forward and she starts moaning loudly. I keep going until I cum inside her. She pulls away and says that she feels better than ever. I don't think she realized how good it felt to just let go and let me fuck her. I guess I'll have to see what happens next time.\n\nThis is a very common scenario among young women who are sexually inexperienced. They may not realize that they need to ask their partners if they'd like to try something new. Or they may believe that they should only give their partner orgasms once. But there are many reasons why a woman may not be able to achieve orgasm through intercourse alone. For example, some women may find themselves unable to climax due to physical problems such as vaginal dryness or pain during penetration. Other women may simply not enjoy intercourse enough to reach orgasm. In these cases, it's important to discuss your desires with your partner. If you're still unsure whether or not you want to try anal sex, it's best to wait until you're ready to explore this option.",
    "As for this year's predictions, I am not sure that many experts and bitcoin enthusiasts on reddit would make a prediction as broad as this one. Maybe the year will be really rough in some way. Maybe it will be very smooth and perfect. I am, however, quite confident that in 2031 there will be a strong, widely known, open, scalable and decentralised digital currency system that will be called Bitcoin or what I call Bitcoin 2.0 in the style of the original Bitcoin. This will be the first open source, peer reviewed, international cryptocurrency. This cryptocurrency will be based on a new generation of technologies called blockchain. It has several distinct advantages over Bitcoin 1.0 which are: 1: It is open-source. Anyone can make and distribute Bitcoin as they see fit. 2: It is decentralized. Its design does not depend on a central body. It can be mined by anyone and used by anyone. 3: It has no central bank and it is not controlled by any state entity, corporation or central bank. This system is run on a globally decentralised network of users called 'Bitcoin miners' and 'Bitcoin users'. 4: It is very small. It will be much smaller than Bitcoin 1.0. Although its market cap is a lot bigger than that of Bitcoin 1.0, its number of users and miners is far fewer: it stands only at about 10 million users and maybe 1 million Bitcoin miners, making it far smaller than the entire community of the first Bitcoin. 5: The network is distributed. At all times. This means that a person can send bitcoins anywhere in the world instantly for free. This is unlike any other digital currency. 6: It is a currency. It is not backed by any commodity, government or any other central body. For that reason its value is not based on any commodity or any other commodity derivative. 7: It has no central bank. 8: It is digital. Bitcoins are created using the mathematics of a new and revolutionary type of digital currency known as blockchain. It allows for the creation of one-of-a-kind financial instruments and digital securities. Its potential uses and applications far outstrip the potential commercial uses. 9: As the system's software code is open-source, anyone can monitor and improve it.\n\nThe post from bitcoin community participant @hussamachine goes even",

    "I'm not sure if this is an actual problem or just a symptom of how I've been feeling lately, but I have been blocked by my parents for several days now. They are very strict with their internet usage and don't allow me to use any social media sites like Facebook or Twitter. My mom even told me that she doesn't want me on her computer because it's too distracting for her. She also said that she would rather see me in person than on the phone. I feel really bad about this, as I love them so much and they're such great people. But I can't seem to get through to them. I know that I should be able to talk to them about anything, but I just can't seem to find the words. Any advice?\n\nThis is a common complaint among young adults who are trying to navigate the world without parental supervision. It's especially true when you live at home with your parents, where there's no one else around to help you out.\n\nBut what happens when you try to explain why you need to go somewhere? What happens when you ask for permission to do something? How does your parent react?\n\nHere are some tips for dealing with your parents' block policy:\n\n1. Don't argue. If you think your parents will back down, then you probably won't succeed. Instead, try to understand why they're doing what they're doing. Explain that you'd appreciate it if they let you visit your grandparents, but that you can't come alone. You might say something like, \"My grandma has Alzheimer's disease and needs constant care. I'll be happy to stay with her until she dies.\" Or, \"If you don't let me visit my grandparents, I'll miss them terribly.\"\n\n2. Try to figure out what you can do to make things easier for yourself. For example, if you're going to a friend's house, you could invite them over instead. If you're going to a restaurant, you could order food online instead of having to wait in line. If you're going to a movie theater, you could buy tickets ahead of time.\n\n3. Be polite. Your parents may not realize that you're upset, but they still have feelings of guilt and shame associated with being unable to spend quality time with you. So, try to remain calm and respectful.\n\n4",
    "I'm in my early 20s and I've been with my girlfriend for about 2 years now. We met at college, we were both pretty much the same age (18-20) and had similar interests. She was very popular and had lots of friends, but she wasn't really interested in dating or anything serious. About two months ago, she started to act different towards me. She would always be talking about how she wanted to go out more and see more people, and that she didn't want to spend all her time with me anymore. It got to the point where I felt like I couldn't talk to her because she wouldn't listen to what I said. I tried to tell her that it's not okay to just ignore you when you're having fun, but she wouldn't listen. After a few weeks of this, I decided to break up with her. I told her that I loved her and that I wanted to stay together, but she refused to accept it. She kept saying that she loves me too much and that she doesn't care if I don't want to date anymore. I finally broke up with her after a week of being angry and crying every day. I feel so betrayed by her. I know that she has feelings for me, but she never showed them to me. I think that she feels guilty about cheating on me and wants to make sure that I won't find out. I don't know what to do. I love her so much, but I can't stand seeing her sad and depressed. What should I do?\n\nThis is an extremely common problem among young women who are still living at home with their parents. They have no money, they have no job prospects, and they have no social life. The only thing keeping them from suicide is the fact that they are afraid of losing their boyfriend/girlfriend. This is why many young women will cheat on their boyfriends/girlfriends even though they know that doing so will destroy their relationship.\n\nIn order to avoid ruining your relationship, you need to understand that there are three types of relationships:\n\n1. A loving relationship where one person gives everything to another person.\n\n2. An abusive relationship where one person abuses the other person physically, emotionally, financially, etc.\n\n3. A non-abusive relationship where one person does not abuse the other person.\n\nIf you",
    "Now, it really doesn't need to be said that it's a bit of a miracle that we have a world where something like this didn't occur. We are fortunate if we all live to see the birth of our children, a day that we will all celebrate together.\n\nWe are fortunate if we're not forced to sit and say goodbye to loved ones, parents, siblings, close friends or significant other. We are fortunate if we're able to put our hands up with pride and express the strength we feel from knowing that one of our own will have a world be able to speak for them. We are fortunate that we are able to share moments together like we did today, one of life's small beauties that has become so inextricably linked and so intertwined with the rest of the universe.\n\nYou see, for a lot of us, that day does not yet exist. For some, that day never did. Others may wake up in the other side of a bullet hole on a battlefield like my dad did, or they might be lucky enough to have a friend who chooses to give up their lives to save yours or theirs during a tragedy like mine.\n\nIt's time to stop and appreciate that those around you are normal. We are grateful for this fact, and all it says is that what's happening right now, those moments that are a far cry from your average day to yours, have to matter just as much to you. That's why it's so important to stay positive, stay strong. That's why doing your normal things after a traumatic event really, really doesn't matter much: it really doesn't matter to us.\n\nBut I do hope those of us who survived this tragedy are able to experience some semblance of a normal life. For many, these days will come, and for a lot of us, it won't happen for a while.\n\nI have some good news about that, at least. I hope others will too.\n\nThank you to everyone for your time. I wish everyone luck. And I hope everyone can use this opportunity to get into a routine and make the most of the time they do have.\n\nTo all my friends and family: I love you.

    "I'm not going to lie, I was pretty disappointed with this book. It's a bit too long for my taste and it doesn't really have any real plot or characters that stand out. The story is about a young man who has been in a coma since he was a child and wakes up to find himself in a world where he can see everything around him. He meets a girl named Alice who seems like she could be his sister but then they discover that she is actually an alien who came here to help him.

I felt like I knew what was going on even when I wasn't sure how. And I loved the way that the author made me care about these two people.

    "I've been sober for about 2 years now, and I'm still amazed at how little has really changed. The biggest change that's happened to me was realizing that I don't need alcohol or drugs to be happy. I can be happy without them. It took me awhile to realize this because it seemed like such an obvious thing to do, but once you accept that you're not dependent on something to make you happy, then everything else falls into place.\n\nIt's funny how things work out sometimes. When I first started drinking, I thought that if I just stopped drinking, I'd feel better. But after a while, I realized that I didn't actually want to stop drinking. I wanted to drink more. And so I drank more. Eventually, I got so drunk that I couldn't even remember what life felt like before I started drinking. So when I finally decided to quit drinking, I had no idea how much worse my life would get.\n\nBut here's the thing: I'm not going back. Not yet. I know that there are people who have made it through the worst times of their lives and managed to stay sober. They may not look exactly like me, but they're still alive. I'm not one of those people. I'll never be able to live up to their standards. But I will always try. Because I believe that if I keep trying, eventually I'll succeed.",
    "This morning I was starting my day by turning on my computer at around 6am. Within an hour it was all black outside, with only a little bit of light coming through. The brightness came back on after 30 seconds. The brightness returned on, but is now more purple than the day before. Any time I use a desktop computer for more than a few minutes, I have to restart it. As many other redditors have reported, this has been happening to a lot of us. I am a college student, so I'm not sure if this is an isolated issue, or if it is a wider issue. This morning I saw another post about a similar situation and was thinking this might be a problem with this type of computer, but as I was going about 30 minutes in, it began to happen to me. The problem has been resolved, for the moment.\n\nA similar thread was posted on XDA-Developers' forums and quickly got more than 1,700 replies in the first 12 hours. There were a lot of suggestions about what to try to help, from adjusting the brightness control and the sleep/work mode on the mouse to using another computer, the only problem being that they were not sure if it would be related to the problem at all.\n\nSeveral users reported that their screens had returned to normal later on, and some even reported that they were able to use their computer without any issues. Some users took to the comments section on Reddit to express their concerns about this bug. Most people said that they had no idea what to do to solve the problem and that there were hardly any solutions that could help them in the short term.\n\nUpdate 1: The screen color problem has now been resolved, a Reddit user says:\n\nNo problem, it has, as of 7am today! The solution: I switched the brightness up by 50%, and it has reverted back to normal by 7:25am.\n\nUnfortunately no new solutions have been devised to get rid of the issue completely.",

    "I've been dating this guy for a month now. I have an older brother on Skype, and we recently started talking about being roommates, so naturally we were sharing our stories through that medium as we both tried to come to terms with recent events, so much family drama and so many moving parts in our lives... He had already invited me over to his place during my Mother's trip last week (she left early and it was our mother's birthday party), and we planned to hang out again after it ended. When I got home that night before going to bed, he said he had something important to tell me... I didn't even want to respond right away because I felt like maybe he just wanted some fun time hanging out with a friend that also happened to be a girl! But finally when I was doing stuff around my room to prepare myself for a busy day tomorrow morning – at which time he'll still be gone for 2 hours… -he asked what I wanted him to do.. So I told her that I really wanted the two of us to get a hotel together after she goes back. After all, it always seemed appropriate that in a relationship there should have to be an element of compromise – not only should you never try to force yourself onto someone else if they don't feel ready yet, but you also should take things slow, know each other well, have enough boundaries of whom/what they can or cannot do, etc. However, with respect, what I really meant by taking their time was making sure everybody was okay.. That part wasn't difficult, but the issue was how many people I knew were there. We both agreed she looked great tonight, and although I would have appreciated seeing all these friends in person – that would mean dealing with social media for most of them, emailing contacts lists, meeting people I only saw online, and possibly even arranging meetups, etc. So for both of us it made sense to plan ahead and set up one more evening with somebody else… And then I told him that I couldn't think of anybody! I could not bring myself to give out any details or explain anything to him since some girls thought they were attractive, some didn't care, others didn't want guys there more than when they left alone, etc. Then I cried and I couldn't tell anyone what happened until just before leaving for work this morning. I needed those first few moments",
    "There is some truth to the story, although there doesn't appear to be any real basis in reality for what the man posted about her as a female character. Some background on herself? She was born male (probably somewhere around 1970), and transitioned into more feminine clothing after marrying a guy who's had very little interest or contact with women before that time. She was active socially all through college but not much afterwards until her wife passed away when she was 25 years old (I think). After that she became depressed/stressed a lot (perhaps due to these events) and became estranged from her husband after they divorced and later remarried. To complicate matters she also suffered from serious back pain but didn't know it at that point. I'd believe she lived by her sense of honor though I'm skeptical that such an event could have inspired such thoughts and feelings. She wasn't doing well emotionally either, but we always thought we were good enough friends for that anyway, even though we weren't particularly close. At one point she took up wrestling because she wanted to express herself through her chosen passion – which is pretty common amongst older folks – without having to deal with the problems caused by traditional gender roles and machismo in most mainstream sports that are popular today. In any case she went to some crazy lengths trying to convince me she was actually a girls' team member who would never turn out to be anything other than another woman. What happened next will probably make you wonder just how much of that information is true! The story has already started gaining traction through a few anonymous subreddits regarding her gender identity rather quickly – including 'r/transfags', 'askmen', 'lgbtq', and 'tfm'. Apparently she attempted suicide two days ago.\n\nNow let me tell you something here. I've seen worse shit from trans folk than someone so self-absorbed that they tried murder after their gender reassignment failed to work; someone who thinks their own penis can save them from every conceivable problem that people with dicks face; someone who goes around calling everyone who doubts the authenticity of her'sexchange surgery' whores and creeps instead of people whom doubt everything about people who try to impersonate girls to get their way. A lot has been said on various blogs across the internet. Here are a handful just to give examples of the level we're talking about now…\n\nBut",
    "I'm not sure if this is true, but it seems like there's some sort of rumor going around that I work for Home Depot. It started when someone posted on my wall about how they were looking to hire me and then another person said that he was working in their office. I don't know what to think about all of this. I've never worked for them or anything else for that matter. I just want to make sure that I'm not being set up for something bad. If you have any information about this, please let me know! Thanks!\n\nThis is an interesting story because it shows that even though she may be a little bit of a troll, she has a lot of fans out there who are willing to believe her. She also has a very loyal fan base who will defend her no matter what.\n\nSo far, we haven't heard back from Lady Gaga. We'll keep our eyes open for more updates as they come in.",
    "A friend and I thought that the most useful recipes were those that required only one item. In order to achieve this with the Horadric Cube or any other crafting table, we would probably need at least 2 perfect souls. We also wanted more than just one items used for it by a combination of being able to make something not on our table, using an unique drop, etc... So we built three new versions of the recipe where you can get two additional items. Both a standard 1-item version, as well as a 2-items version (since that seems to require a soul). The reason why we got two different versions was so that we could have a single perfect item for use in all 3 types of crafting. The 1-link version comes from using the Horadric Cube or any other perfect cube for your first item, before doing anything else; the 2 item setup come after adding another 2 perfect soul gems (note how 2 stones are listed). This gives us 2 perfect hearts to work with if someone has more than likely started making a map. A complete list of materials and links can be found below to help you better understand how they fit into this build/recipe.

    "Hi, Just trying to get a sense of what it's like. How do you deal with a girl who is the ultimate \"you shouldn't ask, you should just let her say no\" type? I'm thinking of this from a purely defensive perspective, but it's really hard to be the kind of guy who just lets these girls get away with their bullshit. It'll be worse if I have shitty game and they're really nice girls that I've just met. It could be that I'm overcompensating and that I go full defensive and fuck up and my dick gets hard and I don't think of my girls too much and I'm too busy worrying about this girl and my ego gets in the way, what are your suggestions to someone in this situation? I've been the kind of guy you'd call \"mean,\" but I've been in relationships with girls who aren't that kind. Some of them were pretty horrible as well, and while I liked them I probably was a little sexist with them that way and I can see why that's seen as a way to put me down. But then again some of them were really decent people who actually didn't mind me \"stalking\" them in some way, so it's possible that my views on women have been warped and I'm the one that should be ashamed. It's also really hard to not be defensive when my girlfriend is the one who wants me to be nice to her. In an ideal world she'd just be okay with me being just like \"fuck her in the ass\" and just having sex with whatever pussy I feel like with, but I think that for some reason she isn't that way, and maybe it's because she feels like I'm trying to dominate her, like she's not worth giving my attention to. I'm not really sure, but maybe the way I've been thinking might be getting to this girl that I like, and if that's me thinking that I should be doing things to get her to not like me, and so her \"not liking me\" is a good thing, that's kind of messed up. The more I think about it, all the girls I've dated who were not horrible were also the kind of girls that I liked, the kind that we could go out and hang out with, the kind that got along well with other people because they were decent and",
    "I'm worried that the Helrik storyline will be too much for some people to handle, and I don't want to see it spoiled by spoilers. So here's my thoughts on what I think happened with Helrik.\n\nFirst off, I have no idea how many episodes there are left in season 4. The last episode was just released yesterday (May 31st). If you're wondering why I say this, it's because I've been watching the show since its first season, and I know that they only air one episode at a time. They usually do a re-airing of an old episode after a few weeks or months, but I haven't seen any of those yet.\n\nSo if you're wondering where I got my information, I can tell you that I watched the entire series through Netflix. I also watched the first two seasons back to back, so I had plenty of time to watch all of them.\n\nNow, let me explain what I mean when I say that I'm not sure how many episodes there are left. When I started watching the show, I thought that there were 12 episodes per season. But then I realized that there were actually 13 episodes per season. And now I realize that there are 14 episodes per season. That means that there are probably more than 20 episodes left in the current season.\n\nBut I still don't know how many episodes there are. Because I didn't start watching until the second season, I never saw the first three episodes of the fourth season. So I don't really know how many episodes there are.\n\nAnd I'm not even going to bother trying to guess how many episodes there are. It's impossible. There's no way to figure out how many episodes there are without knowing exactly how many episodes there are.\n\nWhat I am saying is that I don't know how many episodes there are. I don't know how many episodes there are. I don't know how many episodes there are. I don't know how many episodes there are. I don't know how many episodes there are. I don't know how many episodes there are. I don't know how many episodes there are. I don't know how many episodes there are. I don't know how many episodes there are.

    "Now that there have been no confirmed reports of Ebola cases in the United States, and after I wrote up my own thoughts about why someone might wish to get the plague while in Dallas/Fort Worth I haven¹t heard anything much else about it on there–no links in posts (perhaps they're waiting for more information?), or comments (maybe it's so you can't reply?). So it looks like I'm going to let this one go, unless I run into another outbreak (or if everyone in my city decides to start killing themselves).\n\nYou might be asking yourself, how did the original poster end up writing this? According to an article, posted by The Telegraph in 2013 before the current outbreak of the disease, the CDC advised doctors not to give anyone with non-neurological problems (including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis) antimalarial drugs because the drugs are \"unproven against Ebola virus.\" This is despite their knowing the virus was emerging in West Africa earlier this year, as documented here. A spokesperson at the American Association of Clinical Immunology wrote to CNN that \"there will always be some risk but the probability of getting infected through any medication remains extremely low,\" because these medicines don'¿ t cure any diseases like Ebola does. However, despite admitting there was a small chance of contracting the disease through treatment, the hospital told me their patients were allowed to stay home and continue their routine, even when the doctors had reason to think otherwise! A further problem for some people who are already weakened by medical treatments is malaria — though it kills far more people than Ebola. People living where a country has a large number of people treated with antimalarials, including for cancer (like Dr Lancer) get infected disproportionately due to this, which we've pointed out. In Uganda recently, some hospitals began admitting cancer patients who weren't suffering from severe illness and instead treating them like criminals awaiting execution due to lack of access to health care, leaving many people without access to chemotherapy drugs needed for their pain relief. If you're unfamiliar with HIV, malaria, AIDS, TB, etc., Ebola isn't exactly pleasant news for you either — nor are those sorts of infections particularly common anywhere else on earth.\n\nIn fact, there aren't very many other options to treat Ebola besides anti-malarials; all forms of medicine are not known to work against",
    "It's crazy to think that it's been two months since my first week in Taiwan, but I must have arrived just as the weather was beginning to turn chilly; I had only slept for about 4 hours all day at most during this time, so naturally I wasn't sure what to expect when it came to the bikes on my return to mainland China. Luckily for me, the bike rental guy who brought us all said they would definitely be OK after his warm up ride of them back from their storage (he does it often). As we set out into the night, we continued the tour, enjoying the sights along the way until dark fell. We hit the streets in search of another local hangout where we might grab some food to make our stay more comfortable, and once again, we passed by The Blue Dragon, a good dive bar with a wide selection on beers (in English, which made it difficult for both of us), a variety of local and imported cuisine, or perhaps one of the many Chinese-style tavernas that dot China's cities. This bar is known for being very noisy and chaotic, though not necessarily bad – as we were taking photos and staying somewhat calm, a young couple approached us asking if we wanted \"guāng mín\", a cocktail comprised mainly of the green and white fruit guān xī (or pomegranate) mixed together with whiskey. In essence, you end up sipping your liquor while the rest of the group enjoys the music playing above you; the taste is something like gin and honey topped with rum which provides a sweet-tart note throughout, and with enough alcohol content, these drinks can actually help you forget how cold it's getting outside! It took almost an entire bottle before I could convince my buddies at home to try one – luckily, they drank just enough to be aware of the bitter burn behind my eyes and gave mine away as soon as they finished (my roommate also found his own bottle a little too fruity)! Regardless, this place provided excellent entertainment no matter how busy the scene. Even better was seeing people walking their dogs through the area past our hotel. They never even looked twice at our bikes unless someone directly shouted out: 的还没错他是去被正害手的女人了!, but in practice, everyone just seemed",
    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I was recently in a situation where my girlfriend had an affair with another guy. She told me she didn't know what to do about it because she thought that he would leave her for someone else. I tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn't listen. So I ended up breaking up with her. Now, I don't think she's cheating on me or anything like that (she's still my girlfriend), but I feel bad for her. I've never really been good at dealing with breakups, so I just wanted to share this with you guys. It seems like there are some people who have no problem getting back together with their exes after they've cheated on them. But when it comes to women, we're supposed to be able to handle our own shit. If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, please let us know how you dealt with it! Thanks! -A Redditor\n\nThis is a very common thread among men who cheat on their girlfriends. They often say things like, \"She doesn't deserve me,\" or \"It wasn't my fault.\" The reason why these men feel this way is because they believe that they can get over their ex-girlfriends by themselves. However, as soon as they start dating again, they realize that they aren't ready to deal with the emotional baggage that comes along with being dumped by your former lover.\n\nIn order to avoid having to go through all of that again, many men resort to cheating on their girlfriends. This is especially true if they were previously faithful to their ex-girlfriend. In fact, one study found that more than half of men who cheated on their previous partner did so again within six months.\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, it means that if you're currently in a relationship with someone who cheats on his/her girlfriend, then you should probably consider ending it. You may end up regretting it later, but at least now you'll know exactly what you're going through.",
    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I was at the RSD show in Paris last weekend and it's worth sharing with you all. The Grateful Dead played two shows there on July 31st and August 1st 1972. They were joined by Phil Lesh (who had just returned to the band after a long absence) for the first show and Bob Weir for the second. Both nights were sold out and the crowd was absolutely incredible. It was also the first time that the Dead played in France since their last tour back in 1973. This was the first time they ever played in Europe and the first time they played in France since 1971. The first night was a great one. The sound quality was excellent and the energy level was high. The music was tight and energetic and the audience was very enthusiastic. The second night was even better. The sound quality was much improved and the energy level was higher than the first night. The music was tighter and more focused and the audience was even more enthusiastic. The band sounded great and the crowd was really into it. There were some technical difficulties during the encore which caused the band to stop playing for about 10 minutes. After the break, the band came back out and played a few songs off of the new album. The crowd went wild again as the band started up the song \"Uncle John's Band\". The band then left the stage and the crowd cheered them on as they walked off stage. The show ended with an amazing rendition of \"Playing In The Band\". The entire concert was recorded and will be released on CD/DVD later this year. If you're interested in seeing what the Dead looked like live in France, check out the video below.

    "I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I've had Tourette's since I was about 8 years old. It started out as a mild tic that would only happen when I was stressed or angry and it got worse over time until I couldn't control my body anymore. I went to school with people who were diagnosed with Tourette's and they told me how much it affected their lives. They said that it made them feel like they didn't belong in society because they could never get along with other kids. I thought that maybe I should try to find a cure for myself so that I wouldn't be alone forever. I tried medication, therapy, and even diet changes. Nothing worked. Then one day I found an article on the internet about a drug called Risperdal. The doctor wrote that it helped some people with Tourette's and that it wasn't addictive. So I decided to give it a shot. I took it every morning for two weeks and then stopped. After that I felt better than ever. I still have tics sometimes, but they are less frequent now. I don't think I'll ever go back to taking medication again. I just want to live a normal life without having to worry about being bullied or feeling like I can't talk to anyone.

    "Hi, There's this redditor in my life who I love dearly. We're together almost seven years. We've only gone an entire year without sex, but I know he's into someone else. He recently discovered online that there is a whole other subreddit for a subspecies of humans, the non-monogamous. I'm not a member, and I'm still not comfortable discussing this with him, but the reddit community is extremely supportive of him and I know he knows he's doing the right thing. We're in a fairly long-distance relationship right now and haven't really been able to explore these interests. I asked him if I could keep the subreddit a secret for a while, like a secret tumblr, as is appropriate, and I think I'm doing that. I'm wondering if we could still be friends but not speak of the details of our relationship. I just feel like a secret would have the most impact if he told his friends and family but his friends and family wouldn't know what he's doing.\n\nI've never been jealous of my husband. We're both extremely happy. He is and is not into other women. He has never pressured me to take \"lifestyle\", \"fetish\" or whatever the hell other people are into. He is completely committed to me and has always been supportive, and I don't want to be in a position where things are so good in our relationship, and he isn't. He has a great job and I don't need him to do anything more. We haven't had any problems in the past and it feels like he just discovered these other reddit women and now he wants to know about them. (The other subs in the subreddit I've checked seem to be about love and the meaning of marriage and life, and I think that's what he's drawn to.) He said something, once to me, that had stuck with me from before we were married. I've only remembered it because his friend was making fun of my friend for admitting her affairs and he said something in defense of her and I thought that was kind of sweet. I still feel the same way about him now, and I wish there was more support and open discussion between us. Does anybody have any advice or suggestions like that?\n\nI've seen a fair number of comments on this sub on this very subject. Most are from men who are in a committed but",

And then when I finally did manage to hit him, he would just block it and counterattack.\n\nIt was really strange and frustrating, and I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar.",

    "\n\nI was in an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship for four years. I never told anyone about it because I felt like I couldn't. I felt like no one would believe me because I'm a dude. I was told that I was nothing, that I was worthless, that I was a pathetic liar. I was told that if I ever left, no one would believe me and that I would be ruined.\n\nI finally left a few months ago and I've been in therapy since. I've been doing really well, but I still haven't told anyone about the abuse. I'm scared to. I'm scared that people will think I'm making it up or that I'm just being dramatic. I'm scared that they'll think I'm weak or that I could have stopped it if I'd just been stronger.\n\nBut I know that the only way I'm going to heal is if I tell people what happened. I need to be able to talk about it. I need to be able to tell people that I was abused and that it wasn't my fault. I need to be able to tell my story.\n\nSo if you're out there and you've been through something similar, know that you're not alone. And know that it's okay to talk about it.",

    "As someone new to the concept of an open relationship, I’m finding it a challenging landscape to navigate. My partner suggested the idea and instead of outright rejecting it, I've decided to explore the way this relationship model can fit into our lives. Any helpful advice would be much appreciated. \n\nIt’s important for me to note that there is no lack of spark or love in our relationship. We’ve spent a beautiful time together over the years, and there's always been honesty and respect. \n\nMy partner and I communicated openly about this potential change. They assured me that their wish for an open relationship doesn't signify the desire to end our relationship, but rather to explore their feelings and desires – a notion which calms but also scares me. I have agreed to think about and research this lifestyle more thoroughly, thus this Reddit post.\n\nIf any of you have experienced open relationships - either positive or negative, could you share your perspectives, possibly also including advice about communication, ground rules, dealing with feelings of jealousy, uncertainty or insecurity?\n\nSpecifically, how do you establish and respect boundaries in an open relationship? How do you balance spending quality time with your primary partner while also respecting the other relationships or connections? \n\nMost importantly, how can you ensure you're not losing that exclusive bond with your partner once you decide to explore connections outside your relationship? \n\nAlso, if there are recommended books, podcasts, or other resources on open relationships, feel free to drop them below.\n\nIn the end, I want to make a decision that not only respects my partner's desires but also ensures my feelings and emotions are protected and valued.\n\nThank you in advance for your respectful and helpful responses.",
    "I stumbled upon a comment thread yesterday where a mod mentioned that they were 15. To say I was surprised would be an understatement. I’ve been in this community for over 3 years now and it's always come across as a place curated and maintained by mature and responsible individuals. With all due respect, I don’t see how a 15-year-old, who is still a high school student, can effectively monitor a platform with thousands of active users.\n\nLet me clarify, this is not me age-shaming someone. This is about experience and responsibility. As a user, I do have certain expectations from the mods. Their role is critical in maintaining the integrity, tone, and overall culture of this subreddit. They have to be responsible for handling disputes, issuing warnings, and making important decisions that can impact the community as a whole.\n\nIt's great to see young people take interest in online communities, there's nothing wrong with that. But being a moderator is a different ballpark. It requires a level of maturity and thorough understanding of both the platform and the user base which, no offense, I doubt a 15-year-old would possess.\n\nDoes anyone else share the same concerns? Let's discuss this openly. If it turns out that the age of the mod isn't a significant factor in preserving the quality of subreddits they run, I'll be the first to admit my skepticism was wrong. But, for now, I'm seriously considering looking for another subreddit if this is going to be the new norm.\n",
    "After a lot of self-reflection and introspection, I have decided to make a move many consider as a daunting task. I am beginning my NoFap journey today. This decision comes from the realization that my PMO habit has hit an all time high, and it’s becoming debilitating. I have noticed tangible repercussions such as lack of focus, lethargy, and an overall decrease in life's satisfaction. \n\nI've arrived at this point by acknowledging my harmful habits and introspecting on the kind of person I aspire to be. I want to be someone who has control over their actions and is not a slave to addictions. This journey is not only about abstaining from PMO, but it’s also about pushing my mental barriers, improving discipline, and primarily, regaining control over my life.\n\nMy initial goal is to reach 90 days without PMO, but I understand that NoFap is more of a lifestyle change rather than an isolated challenge. I believe that each minor victory will lead me towards the ultimate success, teaching me to be patient and resilient.\n\nI'm posting this here for two reasons. First, to gain motivation from those of you who have been successful in their NoFap journeys. Secondly, I intend to maintain accountability and transparency about my progress, as I believe that public commitment is a great motivator.\n\nI'm both nervous and excited to embark on this journey. I know this won't be an easy path, but I'm ready and willing to face the challenges that come with it. Any advice, success stories, words of encouragement, or motivation from you guys would be really appreciated as I start this new chapter in my life.\n\nLooking forward to evolving as a person and empowering myself throughout this journey.

    "I've been playing this game for a couple of years now and I've seen it go through numerous updates. Initially, these updates were exciting, bringing in new features, fixing bugs, and generally improving the gameplay experience. However, recently, I've noticed a significant decline in the quality of these updates.\n\nEvery new update now seems to introduce more bugs than it fixes. The game crashes frequently, the graphics glitch, and the load times have become unbearable. The new features, instead of enhancing the gameplay, are making it more complicated and less enjoyable. It feels like the developers are more focused on adding flashy, unnecessary elements rather than improving the core mechanics of the game.\n\nMoreover, the game has become increasingly pay-to-win. Every update introduces new items or characters that can only be obtained through in-game purchases, giving an unfair advantage to those who are willing to spend more money. This is a stark departure from the game's initial promise of being skill-based.\n\nI've tried reaching out to the developers through their customer support, but my concerns seem to fall on deaf ears. It's disheartening to see a game I once loved deteriorate like this. I hope the developers take note of the community's feedback and work towards improving the game, rather than just focusing on monetization.\n\nI wanted to share my thoughts here to see if anyone else feels the same way. Maybe if enough of us voice our concerns, the developers might take notice and make some much-needed changes.",

From what I understand, investors can lend shares to other individuals or institutions, often for short selling purposes. \n\nIf I own shares of a certain company, does it make financial sense for me to lend them out? How does the return work on this - do I get a fixed rate or is it based on how much the stock appreciates/depreciates?  \n\nAlso, I've read about the risks of the borrowed shares not being returned. Is this a common occurrence or more of a rare possibility?\n\nI would really appreciate if someone could explain these aspects to me in simpler terms, and any advice for or against the practice of lending shares would be welcome as well!

    "Quin69, a popular Twitch streamer, was in the middle of a heated gameplay session when his game suddenly crashed. As thousands of viewers watched, he voiced his frustration, but couldn't pinpoint why it happened. Theories floated around, including connectivity issues or software bugs. But the real culprit? A Windows update forced a system reboot.\n\nWhile Quin69 was deep into the game, his operating system had a pending Windows update. It automatically initiated its standard procedure: a restart. Now, here's where things went south. Quin69's update settings had been set for automatic updates without prompting the user, which is usually not a big deal, but it becomes one when controversially Windows decides to do it in the middle of a live game stream.\n\nIt's a relatable situation for many gamers and streamers. The episode serves as a reminder to keep track of your system's settings, especially if you're in the middle of a critical gaming session and Windows decides it's the perfect time for that hefty update.\n\nJust to clarify, this isn't an intended dig at Windows. Chances are, any other operating system would have done something similar. The idea is to take this moment as a lesson that it's better to manage your settings effectively to avoid any such unexpected, game-breaking moments.",

    "Over the years, I've had experiences of random sensations on my face that, after a thorough medical check-up, turned out to be benign or have no identifiable cause, therefore considered idiopathic.

I had a strong connection to the Test family, where Johnny Test, the 11-year-old headstrong boy who became my childhood hero, was breaking the monotony of a commoner's life with his super genius twin sisters. The way Johnny used his sisters' inventions to live his adventurously relatable life was the highlight of many of my after school evenings.\n\nNow, hearing about the reboot of Johnny Test is giving me mixed feelings. On one hand, like every nostalgic millennial, I'd love to relive my childhood memories. On the other hand, I'm scared that the original essence of the show may get lost in the transition to 2021.\n\nPersonally, reboots have always been a cause for concern for me. There've been numerous instances where the reboots have failed to capture the magic of the original series and ended up ruining the franchise instead. These new reboots often change character dynamics, art style, and most importantly, the root of the show that connected with audiences in the first place.\n\nThe sudden influx of reboots is also a bit depressing, as it makes me feel like the industry is running out of fresh ideas and is heavily leaning on the nostalgia factor to sell their shows, often forgoing quality and storytelling in the process. I want to be proven wrong though and I hope Johnny Test's reboot does justice to the original.\n\nI haven't heard much about how the show plans to maintain the original elements that stole our hearts in the first place, such as Dukey's friendship and the girls' scientific experiments going haywire. Is it too much to ask that they keep the essence of the original while adding new plots and twists?\n\nAll in all, as an avid Johnny Test fan, this reboot comes with excitement but also a certain level of trepidation. Only time will tell if it'll do justice to the original or end up as another stark example of a \"ruined\" reboot. I’m cautiously optimistic and hope they manage to preserve the heart and soul of Johnny Test while navigating it through the modern era.",
    "I hope this message finds you well, especially if you're feeling down right now. The purpose of this post isn't to make your troubles disappear magically, but to remind you that it's okay to feel upset, it's okay to experience bad days. Bad days are part of life, they form the darkest threads that are essential in the creation of our life's tapestry.\n\nAlways remember that bad days are temporary. Everyone has them, and it isn't something unusual to have a rough day. Consider it an opportunity to grow, to become mentally and emotionally stronger. Sometimes, things go wrong, but that's just life testing you to unveil your hidden strength and resilience. Stand firm during those days, and when they pass, you'll emerge victorious.\n\nOn these tough days, you might think you are alone, but let me assure you, you are not. Online communities like Reddit and real-life support systems are there to share the load. Don't hesitate to reach out. Talk to someone. Express yourself. Letting it out can help you feel lighter. \n\nRemember, it's normal to be upset, feel stuck, or be dissatisfied. Acknowledge your feelings, but don't let them overpower you. Engage in things you find comforting. Maybe it's a book, a movie, relaxing music, or even a walk in the park. Pamper yourself, and more importantly, be patient with yourself.\n\nRemember, when a flower doesn't bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower itself. Similarly, if you're having a tough time, consider changing your environment or circumstances, instead of blaming yourself.\n\nLife isn't always sunshine and rainbows. It has its ups and downs. Every day is a new chapter. If today was a bad day, remember, there's always a chance for a better tomorrow. \n\nPlease, be kind to yourself. After all, you're the one who's been through everything with you. Surely there's a massive strength within you.\n\nTake care of yourself. Mental health is just as important as physical health. No storm lasts forever. Remember, sunshine follows the rain. Roll with life, and don't lose hope. Hang in there. You are so much stronger than you think.\n\nWishing you better days ahead. Take care of yourself because, when the dark clouds clear, you have a lot of happiness awaiting you out there. Keep going, breathe, and you will conquer this phase, just as you have conquered everything life has thrown at you so far. You are",
    "So, this happened a few years ago when I was in my early twenties. I was at a friend's house party, and we decided to drop some acid. It was my first time, and I was both excited and nervous. \n\nThe trip started off great. Colors were more vibrant, sounds were more intense, and I felt a deep connection with everyone around me. We were all having a blast, just hanging out, listening to music, and enjoying the trip. \n\nA few hours in, someone suggested we go for a walk. It seemed like a great idea at the time. We were in a suburban area, so we weren't too worried about running into anyone. We set off, a group of about six of us, laughing and joking as we wandered the streets. \n\nSuddenly, we saw flashing lights in the distance. We all froze, our laughter dying in our throats. The lights were getting closer, and we realized it was a police car. Panic set in. We were all tripping, and the last thing we wanted was to interact with the police. \n\nWithout thinking, I took off running. I could hear my friends calling after me, but I didn't stop. I ran through backyards, jumped over fences, and even waded through a small creek. I was convinced the cops were right behind me, even though I never actually saw them. \n\nEventually, I ended up in a wooded area. I hid there for what felt like hours, my heart pounding in my chest. I was terrified, but also exhilarated. The trees seemed to pulse with life, and I felt like I was part of some grand adventure. \n\nWhen I finally made my way back to my friend's house, everyone was there, safe and sound. Turns out, the cops were just passing by. They hadn't even noticed us. \n\nLooking back, it was a pretty reckless thing to do. But at the time, it felt like the most logical thing in the world. That's the power of acid, I guess. It can make you see things that aren't there, and make you do things you wouldn't normally do. \n\nI've learned my lesson, though. If I ever decide to trip again, I'll make sure to do it in a safe, controlled environment. And I'll definitely stay away from the cops.",
    "I'm writing this post in the throes of the most challenging experience of my life, and I am in desperate need of support, advice, and understanding from those who may have gone through something similar. I feel like I am in uncharted territory and need some reassurance.\n\nI am a 37-year-old woman with PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) who has been struggling with fertility issues for as far back as I can remember. After years of frustrating doctors' appointments, a multitude of treatments, and more grueling rounds of IVF than I care to recall, I was overjoyed to finally experience the miracle of pregnancy for the very first time. The sheer happiness of those two pink lines appearing on the pregnancy test is hard to put into words. It felt like every tear, every needle prick, every hurdle that we had overcome was worth it for this moment.\n\nBut then, last week at the doctor's office, we received heartbreaking news - there was no heartbeat. As you can imagine, this news has crushed me and my partner. It feels like a cruel joke has been played on us. We were so close, and then in an instant, our dreams were taken away. The grief, frustration, confusion- it’s all too much to handle. My partner is supportive, but he has the privilege of detachment, it's not his body that failed.\n\nI'm currently waiting for a scheduled D&C procedure. The days feel long and nights longer. Physically, I'm prepared for what's to come, but emotionally, I feel desperate, hollow, and alone.\n\nI guess I'm looking for some words of comfort, similar stories, or if anyone has gotten pregnant and had a successful pregnancy after such an experience. How did you cope with this heartbreaking loss? Does it get easier? I just want some connection- some evidence that there is hope. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read through this.\n\n(Note: I understand that everyone's journey with fertility is different. One person’s experience isn't indicative of what will happen to another person. I'm not seeking medical advice in this post, just emotional support).",
    "Hey everyone, \n\nI apologize in advance if this post becomes a ramble. My mind is a whirlwind right now and I'm desperate for some clarity or advice. I don't know who to reach out to or where to begin, so I thought I'd start here.\n\nFor the past few months, life has been increasingly difficult. Every day I find it harder to get up in the morning, to put a smile on my face, to convince myself that everything's alright. I struggle to even eat or sleep properly. Things which used to excite and motivate me no longer hold any interest or appeal. I feel like I'm stuck in a perpetual state of sadness and it's suffocating me.\n\nIt has started to affect my relationships, my work, my studies - every aspect of my life. People around me have begun noticing my change in mood and behavior but I can't bring myself to tell them about these feelings. It's difficult to explain - hell, I barely understand it myself. It feels like I'm trapped in a dark room with no doors or windows, and I can't escape.\n\nI've tried self-help books, guided meditation, online resources, but nothing seems to be working. \n\nI'm making this post mainly out of desperation. I don't know what to do or how to cope with this. Maybe some of you have been through the same situation and can share advice or resources that worked for you. Maybe some of you are professionals who can guide me toward potential treatment. I'm open to anything at the moment.\n\nLastly, I do want to clarify that I'm not currently a danger to myself or others - I know that's a common concern with these kinds of posts. I just really need help figuring out what these feelings could mean, and how I can start to feel better.\n\nThank you in advance for any guidance you can provide. I appreciate it more than you know.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the support I've received. I can't express how comforting it is to know that I'm not alone and that help is available. I will seek out professional help soon.",
    "So I spent a good chunk of daylight yesterday outside, just basking in the wonderful weather that we're suddenly having. After being cooped up for most of the previous week, it honestly felt like paradise to feel the sun on my skin and hear the birds chirping again after such a long winter. \n\nNow here's the problem - during this blissful enjoyment, I completely disregarded one crucial fact: I have Polymorphous Light Eruption (PMLE). I was diagnosed a couple of years ago when I experienced some bizarre reactions after sun exposure. However, in my excitement, it completely slipped my mind.\n\nFor those who may not know, PMLE is a sort of allergic reaction to the sun. When the skin is exposed to sunlight, especially after a long time of not being exposed to the sun, it flares up and can lead to incredibly itchy bumps, blisters, and patches.\n\nJust wanted to share my situation with all here as a reminder to be aware and practice sun protection, especially if you have any sun-sensitive conditions. Adhere to necessary precautions such as using high SPF sunblock, wearing protective clothing, and limiting sun exposure.\n\nGuess who ended up with an awfully itchy, red, and bumpy rash all over the arms and legs? Yours truly! Now, I'm back to being indoors and applying topical creams while chugging anti-histamines to soothe this flare-up.\n\nSun, why do this to your biggest fan? Has anyone else had experiences with PMLE or other sun allergies? Would love to hear how you manage these and maybe get some tips!",
    "So here's the situation, I've been with my girlfriend for about two years now and for the most part, things have been really great. We get along, we have similar interests, and I genuinely care about her a lot. But over the past couple of months, I've started to notice some changes in her behaviour which has me pretty worried.\n\nShe’s been doubling down on her work, pulling double or sometimes even triple shifts than what is required of her. She always seems stressed out and tired and has stopped taking care of herself the way she used to. Our conversations have become repetitive and lack depth. It’s all about work, work, and more work.\n\nI've tried talking to her about it, asking if there's anything I can do to help or support, but she brushes me off by saying that she's just busy and doesn't have as much time as before. She's basically pushed me away and refuses to let me close, emotionally or physically. I feel like she's spiralling, and I feel so helpless watching it happen.\n\nI do love her and want things to work out, but it's becoming increasingly difficult given her current state. I want to be there for her and support her, but I can't if she continuously pushes me away. It's been a rough couple of months and to be honest, my patience is worn thin. I’m tired of being an emotional punching bag and I don’t even know if she realises what she’s doing to me and us.\n\nSo here I am, hoping to find some advice, maybe from someone who has been in a similar situation. How did you cope? Or can someone advise me on how to approach her without it spiralling into a whole argument as usual? How can I make her realise that she's pushing me away and destroying our relationship? I'm at a loss here and any advice or suggestions would be truly appreciated.",
    "When it comes to rebuilding Imperial City, a number of factors come into play to determine the costs. \n\nThe first factor is labor cost. This accounts for the wages of the workers, architects, engineers, project managers, etc. Labor makes up a sizable portion of the cost and it's based on local wage standards.\n\nThe second aspect is material costs. The selection of building materials greatly impacts the rebuilding cost. The higher the quality, the greater the cost. This includes everything from steel and concrete to wood or ivory, depending on the specific parts of Imperial City being rebuilt.\n\nAnother significant factor is the extent of the damage or destruction. If Imperial City was ravaged by a large-scale conflict, the reconstruction cost will be much higher. More destruction equals more areas that need rebuilding, driving up both labor and material costs.\n\nThe level of tech being used, both in terms of the reconstruction process and the intended final product, also plays into the cost. Use of magic (if we're keeping to Elder Scrolls lore here), advanced machinery, or high-tech amenities in the city would increase the cost.\n\nThe last factor comes in the form of logistics and administrative costs. This includes costs related to planning and managing the project, procurement and transportation of materials, dealing with any legal and regulatory requirements, etc. \n\nThese are some of the main factors that determine the rebuilding cost of Imperial City. Each situation can be unique so it's hard to say exactly how much the rebuild would cost without a concrete estimation based on these factors.",
    "While I acknowledge that the Edmund Fitzgerald is an absolute tragedy, I feel that the song, \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\" by Gordon Lightfoot, is vastly overrated. Yes, it tells a very dramatic and real story, and yes, it's memorializing a disaster in a melodious way, but there are other songs out there that are equally or more emotionally engaging and do the same thing. Gordon Lightfoot's storytelling is exemplary, but the song is not a monument of musical accomplishment.\n\nThe melody is rather repetitive and doesn't quite capture the sinister nature of the narrative. I'm not denying the song's folk appeal, but apart from being a sorrowful tale, it doesn't offer much in terms of musical dynamics. It's more of a narrated incident with a single, rather monotonous, tune playing in the background.\n\nMoreover, I feel that the cult-like status this song has received within the folk music scene is somewhat undeserved. There are other maritime disaster songs such as \"Mary Ellen Carter\" by Stan Rogers or \"Fire and Water\" by Fotheringay that were more emotionally powerful and musically challenging but have never quite received the same level of recognition.\n\nI believe that the popularity of the song is partly driven by the dramatic lore surrounding the shipwreck rather than its musical merit. Ultimately, I would challenge folk music enthusiasts to delve deeper into the genre to discover underrated gems that surpass \"The Wreck of Edmund Fitzgerald\".",
    "I'm at my wit's end here and could really use some advice. I have a 3-year-old male cat, neutered, who's been with me since he was a kitten. He's an indoor/outdoor cat, and he's always been very sociable and friendly with other cats in the neighborhood. However, about a month ago, a new cat showed up in our area and has been causing a lot of trouble.\n\nThis new cat is also a male, and he's significantly larger than my cat. He's been attacking my cat almost every time he goes outside. I've seen it happen a few times, and it's not playful wrestling - it's full-on aggression. My cat has come home with scratches and bite marks multiple times, and it's clear he's scared to go outside now.\n\nI've tried to talk to my neighbors to see if anyone knows who this cat belongs to, but no one seems to know. I've also tried to scare the cat away when I see him in my yard, but he just comes back later. I don't want to keep my cat indoors all the time because he loves being outside, but I'm worried about his safety.\n\nI'm not sure what to do at this point. I've considered calling animal control, but I'm hesitant because I don't want the other cat to be put down or anything. I just want him to stop attacking my cat. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions? I'm really desperate here.",
    "So, I've been into K-pop for a good couple of years now and can safely say I'm loving the music, the choreography, the entire aesthetic. Groups like BTS, Blackpink, EXO, etc are literally all I listen to.\n\nBut surprisingly enough, I never managed to get into K-dramas. I've tried watching a few, like Crash Landing on You and Goblin because everyone recommends them and they're supposedly some of the best. But I just couldn't feel the vibe and suspense that everyone talks about.\n\nIt’s not that I don’t enjoy dramas or series in general. I watch plenty of Western TV shows and have enjoyed various genres from GoT to The Office. But something about K-dramas doesn't seem to sit with me. \n\nIs this strange considering how much I love K-pop? Do any of you feel the same way? Any suggestions or insights are greatly welcome!",
    "I have a younger brother who's 16 years old and he's starting to show signs of male pattern baldness. It's not severe yet, but it's noticeable. I've been using finasteride (commonly known as fin) for a few years now and it's been working wonders for me. I'm considering suggesting it to him, but I'm not sure if it's appropriate given his age. \n\nI've read about potential side effects and I'm worried about how it might affect him, especially his hormonal development at this crucial age. I'm also concerned about the psychological impact of starting such a treatment so young. \n\nOn the other hand, I don't want him to go through the same self-esteem issues I faced when I started losing my hair at a young age. \n\nI'm torn between wanting to help him and not wanting to potentially harm him. I'd appreciate any advice or experiences you guys could share. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What did you do?",
    "I've been thinking a lot about how difficult it can be to make friends as an adult. It seems like when we were kids, it was so much easier. You could just walk up to someone on the playground, ask if they wanted to play, and boom, you had a new friend. But as adults, it's not quite as simple.\n\nFirstly, we're all so busy. Between work, family, and other responsibilities, it can be hard to find the time to meet new people. And even when we do have the time, it can be difficult to know where to start. It's not like we can just walk up to someone at the grocery store and ask if they want to hang out.\n\nSecondly, there's the issue of compatibility. As adults, we have more defined personalities and interests. This can make it harder to find people we click with. And even when we do find someone we get along with, there's always the fear of rejection. What if they don't like us as much as we like them?\n\nDespite these challenges, I believe it's still possible to make friends as an adult. It might take more effort and intentionality, but it can be done. Here are a few strategies I've found helpful:\n\n1. Join a club or group: This can be a great way to meet people with similar interests. Whether it's a book club, a running group, or a hobby club, these types of groups provide a natural setting for friendships to form.\n\n2. Volunteer: Volunteering not only allows you to give back to your community, but it also puts you in contact with other caring individuals. These can be great foundations for friendships.\n\n3. Take a class: Whether it's a cooking class, a language class, or a fitness class, learning something new can be a great way to meet people.\n\n4. Be open: Sometimes, potential friends are already in our lives, but we're too focused on our own issues to notice. Try to be open to the people around you. You never know who might be feeling the same way you are.\n\n5. Be patient: Friendships take time to develop. Don't rush things. Let them develop naturally.\n\nI hope these tips are helpful. I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this topic. How have you made friends as an adult? What challenges have you faced? What strategies have you found helpful?",

    "So, here's my story. \n\nFor years, I've dealt with depression. It has been ravaging my life on all fronts. That led to me doing some research on non-traditional treatments for my ailment after conventional medicine did little to help. I came across a drug known as ketamine, initially used as an anesthetic, but showing promising results in the treatment of bipolar disorder and depression. I knew I was stepping into murky waters, but desperate times called for desperate measures.\n\nI began using ketamine, small doses at first, just to see if it could help. I cannot lie, it was successful. I felt more up and resilient than I had in years. But with success came reliance. As I became more and more dependent on Ketamine, I began to lose sense of my original goal and craved the drug instead.\n\nOne particular night, I was chilling in my house, just after a dose of ketamine. I've always been a cautious user, never letting the drug take complete rein over my consciousness. I was sitting in the living room when I noticed the smell of smoke. It was faint at first and quite easy to dismiss. I ignored it. There could've been numerous innocent sources - a neighbor’s barbecue, some burning leaves, you know the usual stuff. But as the minutes ticked by, the smell became more pungent and began to take over the room.\n\nMy brain went on high alert. I followed the source of the smoke and what I found was something you only see in nightmares. My kitchen was in flames. An unattended pot on the stove was the culprit. The flames were quickly reaching the ceiling and black smoke was starting to fill the room. \n\nLuckily, ketamine has a side effect: diminished response to fear. While sober-me would probably have panicked, ketamine-me was surprisingly calm in the face of potential disaster. Instead of freezing or running away, I swiftly grabbed the fire extinguisher from under the sink and managed to put out the fire before it spread further.\n\nPost-incident, the realization of what could have happened hit me like a ton of bricks. I had gotten away with recklessness, with a combination of luck and unintended preparedness. As it sinks in, I realize how my addiction could have led to disaster. It's clear to me now that addiction isn't a sustainable solution for my depression or anything for that matter. I need to stop seeking momentary happiness in a potentially deadly habit.\n\nStopping is easier said than done, I know it.",

    "I've been doing some research on leveraged ETFs, specifically those focused on the semiconductor industry. Given the rapid growth and innovation in the tech sector, I'm considering investing in these ETFs as a way to potentially maximize my returns. \n\nHowever, I'm aware that leveraged ETFs come with their own set of risks, including the potential for significant losses. They are designed to deliver multiples of the performance of the index or benchmark they track. For instance, a leveraged ETF might aim to deliver double the daily return of a specific index. But this also means they could potentially deliver double the loss.\n\nI'm particularly looking at ETFs like SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares ETF) and USD (ProShares Ultra Semiconductors). Both of these ETFs aim to deliver triple the daily performance of their underlying index.\n\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts on these types of investments.

    "Guten Tag alle,\n\nich möchte gern für eine offene Diskussion stellen. In letzter Zeit habe ich festgestellt, dass mit zunehmender Frustration und Unsicherheit über die aktuelle Koronapolitik viele Menschen gerne in der sogenannten \"Querdenker\"-Bewegung landen. Das Problem dabei ist allerdings, dass viele Menschen sich von dieser Bewegung distanzieren, weil sie oft mit Verschwörungstheorien und radikalen Meinungen assoziiert wird.\n\nAber gibt es andere Gruppierungen oder Bewegungen, die auch kritische Fragen zur C-Politik stellen, jedoch ohne diese radikale Denkansatz? Eine Bewegung, die eine gesunde Diskussion, transparente Regierungsentscheidungen zu Corona und möglicherweise auch die Überprüfung von Einschränkungen fordert, ohne dabei in Extremismus und \"Aluhut\"-Praktiken zu verfallen?\n\nIch denke, es ist wichtig, in Zeiten wie diesen unsere Ängste und Bedenken auszudrücken, ohne dabei die Wissenschaft oder die Realität zu leugnen.

    "Ever since I started playing 'Universe: A galactic conquest', I have had this thought brewing in my mind, so I thought to come here and share it with my fellow gamers. \n\nThis idea is about a new superweapon - a 'Planet Annihilator'. I know, I know, the name sounds a bit dramatic, doesn't it? But hear me out. \n\nIt's a weapon of enormous destructive power that can entirely wipe out a planet from existence. It would be an end game weapon that can tilt the course of a campaign immediately. Sounds overpowered, right? But it's not without its balances. \n\nFirst, it would take a lot of resources to even start the construction of this weapon. The resources would be so vast - think the entire production of a high-resource world over several gaming years. Also, it would take a significant amount of time to complete it. Plus, there's the risk of other players getting wind of your plans and making their moves against it.\n\nThere could also be severe diplomatic penalties for even starting to build this weapon, potentially leading to alliances against you. If you successfully deploy it and destroy a world, it would lead to near-universal condemnation, making it even tougher for you to navigate the game diplomacy. \n\nThe 'Planet Annihilator' would also not be selective, i.e., you couldn't choose what to destroy. Upon its activation, everything on the planet, including your assets, would cease to exist.\n\nYou'd essentially use it as a last resort - when there's either nothing left to lose, or you want to go all-in to win the game. Both scenarios are sure to bring a thrill!\n\nI understand this has the potential to be quite broken, and many of you might dismiss this as an absurd idea. However, I think it could add a certain level of strategic depth, potential alliances and betrayals that could make the game more exciting.\n\nAgain, it's just a thought, but I'd love to hear what others think of this idea and maybe some ways to keep it balanced yet impactful within the game?",

    "I'm really struggling with something and I hope someone can offer some advice or insight. My boyfriend, who I've been dating for about six months now, always forces me to kiss him whenever we argue or have a disagreement. At first, I thought it was because he wanted to make up or show affection, but lately, I've started to feel like it's more than that.\n\nIt's like he's using it as a way to assert his dominance over me. Like, if I don't want to do what he wants, he'll grab my face and make me kiss him until I give in. It's really starting to feel like emotional blackmail and it's making me feel super uncomfortable and even scared sometimes.\n\nI know he doesn't love me. He's never said it and has even told me that he doesn't believe in love. So why is he doing this? Is it just a form of control? A way to keep me under his thumb? I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him all the time, never knowing when he'll blow up at me or try to manipulate me into doing what he wants.\n\nI've tried talking to him about how his behavior makes me feel, but he just brushes it off and tells me I'm being paranoid. That I should be grateful he cares enough to want to kiss me. But honestly, it feels anything but loving or caring. It feels oppressive and controlling.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "Reality is harsh and unjust. It can be difficult to face, especially when things don't go our way or when life throws us lemons one after another. But when someone tells you to just 'accept that reality sucks', consider this: it may well mean they have been shielded from true struggle - the kind that changes perspectives for years to come - their whole lives long.\nMany who say such things haven't seen desperation nor felt trauma or hunger pangs. They are strangers to homelessness, poverty and the feeling of dodging debts with every passing month. Their idea of \"hard times\" might only extend as far as getting fired from a cushy job only to find an even better-paying one immediately after, never wondering what would happen next if that hadn't happened. And so, tell me now: how could anyone truly believe giving up on our dreams will make us stronger? The truth is, those making such claims probably never had anything to lose in the first place!\nYou see, sugarcoating painful realities doesn't do much help for people still facing them head on daily without any support systems around them; in fact by ignoring these truths we take away chances of creating meaningful change within ourselves which helps break down boundaries preventing others who need it most from finding success too. Instead of settling for less than mediocrity solely because “that’s just how it goes\", let's use our struggles themselves as motivations towards changing an often cruel world into something greater than itself—an opportunity at redemption rather than resignation--starting today! Let this mindset permeate through communities everywhere so no person has ever feel forced again into accepting their sad fates without question!! Together we can shift our focus on building each other up using past grievances as fuel instead helping bring everyone toward joy step by step until ultimately succeeding beyond measure across generations!!",
    "Hey fellow Redditors,\n\nI've been experiencing some pretty vivid and immersive hallucinations lately, and I'm having trouble distinguishing between hypnagogia and psychosis. I know they're related, but I'm not sure when it's one and not the other.\n\nFor those who don't know, hypnagogia is the state of being between being awake and asleep, and it can involve hallucinations, lucid dreaming, and other trippy experiences. Psychosis, on the other hand, is a mental health condition where a person experiences a disconnection from reality, often accompanied by hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.\n\nMy question is, how do I know when my hallucinations are just a result of hypnagogia and when they're a sign of psychosis? I've been experiencing some pretty wild and vivid hallucinations lately, and I'm worried that they might be indicative of something more serious.\n\nI've tried researching the difference between the two, but it's hard to find clear information on the subject. Some sources say that hypnagogia is a normal and harmless part of the sleep cycle, while others say that it can be a symptom of an underlying mental health condition.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar? How did you determine whether it was hypnagogia or psychosis? Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n[Your Name]",
    "I've been trying to get into 3D art and Blender has been my go-to software for a while now. I've been learning a lot and messing around with different tools, but there's something that really frustrates me. I can't believe there isn't a crease set tool addon out there!\n\nFor those who don't know, a crease set tool is a function in Blender that allows you to add detailed, defined folds and wrinkles to your clothes. It's a feature that's available in other 3D software like Marvelous Designer, but for some reason, it's not available in Blender. It's such a useful feature, especially for creating realistic clothing and characters.\n\nI understand that there are some workarounds, like using sculpting tools or baking normal maps, but those methods just aren't the same. They're time-consuming and difficult to get right. It's frustrating that Blender, a software that's otherwise so powerful and versatile, lacks this important feature.\n\nI've searched everywhere for a solution, but nothing seems to exist. I've checked the Blender forums, Reddit, and even GitHub, but there's nothing out there. I'm starting to think that I'm the only one who wants this feature!\n\nIt's possible that the Blender developers just haven't gotten around to it yet, or maybe there's a technical reason why it's not possible to implement. But seriously, this feature would make Blender so much more useful for creating clothing and characters.\n\nI'm not asking for much, just a simple crease set tool that allows us to add folds and wrinkles to our models with ease. Is that too much to ask?!\n\nSo, Blender developers, if you're listening, please consider adding a crease set tool to your software. It would make a lot of people very happy. And if anyone out there knows of a hidden feature or workaround that I haven't found yet, please, please let me know!",
    "Hey fellow Redditors,\n\nI'm hoping someone can help me out with my 3rd gen Tacoma's electrical problems. I've had this truck for a few years now and it's been a great ride, but lately, I've been having some issues with the electrical system.\n\nFirst, the battery keeps draining even when the truck is turned off. I've tried replacing the battery and the alternator, but the problem persists. I've also noticed that the interior lights stay on even when the doors are closed and the truck is off. It's like there's a ghost in my truck that's keeping the lights on.\n\nAnother issue I'm having is with the stereo. The display screen keeps going blank and the audio cuts out. It's like the stereo is possessed or something. I've tried resetting the stereo and even replaced the head unit, but the problem still persists.\n\nLastly, the dashboard lights have started flickering on and off. It's like the truck is trying to communicate with me, but I'm not sure what it's trying to say. I've checked the fuses and they seem to be fine.\n\nI've taken my truck to a mechanic and they couldn't find anything wrong. I'm at a loss for what to do. Has anyone else experienced these issues with their 3rd gen Tacoma? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
    "Sure! Here's the body of the Reddit post:\n\nHey fellow dank memers, today I want to talk about my unironic love for Bananieeee! 😅 I know what you're thinking - \"But wait, aren't they just cheap knockoffs of our lord and savior, Dole?\" And to that, I say... kind of? But let me tell you why I still stan them so hard.\n\nFirst of all, as we all know, Dole is the OG purple potassium king. Their tropical vibes and luscious texture make them an iconic snack that never goes out of style. BUT, let's be real for a second, their price tag can sometimes be a little too steep for this poor college student's budget. That's where our beloved nanner comes in - same great taste, lower cost. It's like the Ying to Dole's Yang, if you will.\n\nAnd have you guys tried them with peanut butter or Nutella? Game changer. You get that rich, chocolatey goodness without breaking the bank. Not to mention how perfectly they curve around the filling, creating the perfect ratio of banana-to-chocolate in every bite. (Yes, I am aware that Dole does have a PB version, but that's beside the point). \n\nIn conclusion, while they may lack the prestige of our sweet, sweet Doles, nancies are definitely worth their spot on store shelves everywhere. They might even earn some converts - who knows, maybe one day, they'll surpass their predecessors and become known as the superior snack 🤯 Mind blowing, right? Any other fans here? Let's manifest it together 🔮",
    "I was completely caught off guard when my ex reached out to me over two years after our breakup. We had been together for about three years, and the breakup was definitely not amicable. There were hurtful words said on both sides, and we basically ceased all communication immediately after.\n\nFast forward to now, and I've moved on with my life. I'm in a new relationship, and I thought I had finally put that chapter of my life behind me. But then, out of the blue, I get a message from my ex on social media. My heart skipped a beat as I saw their name pop up on my screen.\n\nAt first, I was hesitant to even open the message. Part of me didn't want to rehash old wounds or revisit those painful memories. But something inside of me urged me to read it, so I took a deep breath and clicked on the message.\n\nTo my surprise, my ex apologized for everything that went down between us. They acknowledged how they had wronged me during the relationship and the breakup, and expressed regret for their actions. They also mentioned that they had been doing some soul-searching and personal growth work, which led them to realize the harm they had caused me.\n\nI have to admit, reading those words felt pretty surreal. It was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders, knowing that my ex had taken responsibility for their part in our failed relationship. I never expected an apology, let alone one this sincere and heartfelt.\n\nNow, I'm not sure what the future holds for us. Maybe we can be friends? Or maybe this is just closure and we'll go our separate ways again. Either way, I feel a sense of peace that I hadn't experienced in a long time.\n\nHas anyone else ever received an apology from an ex years after the fact? How did you handle it?",
    "Absolutely! Here's a possible Reddit post:\n\nI can't believe what I'm seeing. A friend of mine just sent me a video of some dude going off on a rant about how magic is real, and let me tell you, it's a doozy. This guy is like a caricature of every stereotype about magical believers. He's got the whole nine yards - wand-waving, incantations, the works. And all because someone had the audacity to question his belief in magic.\n\nBut that's not even the best part. The kicker is that he's trying to use science to back up his claims. Like, seriously? You're gonna try to use the scientific method to prove that magic is real? That's like trying to use algebra to prove the existence of unicorns. It's just not happening, buddy.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the logical fallacies. This guy's arguments are so full of holes, it's like a colander. \"Magic is real because I saw it in a dream once.\" Okay, sure, and I'm sure the pizza delivery guy was actually a time-traveling alien too. \"Magic is real because ancient civilizations believed in it.\" Yeah, and they also thought the Earth was flat.\n\nIt's just so frustrating to see people clinging to these ridiculous beliefs in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. I mean, come on, guys. Magic is fun and all, but let's keep it where it belongs - in fantasy novels and movies. Don't try to pass it off as fact. It's embarrassing for everyone involved.",

I used to have a clear sense of purpose and direction, but over the past year or so, things have changed and I feel like I've lost my way. I'm not sure what I want to do with my life or what brings me fulfillment.\n\nI've tried a few things to try and find my way back, like taking up new hobbies, volunteering, and even switching careers, but nothing seems to stick.

    "There are several reasons why people tend to drive above the speed limit, despite the potential risks and consequences. One reason is that many drivers feel that the speed limits on highways and roads are unrealistically low, and that they can safely drive at higher speeds without putting themselves or others in danger. Additionally, some drivers may feel pressure to arrive at their destination as quickly as possible, whether it be for work, school, or personal obligations, and may believe that driving above the speed limit is necessary to achieve this goal.\n\nAnother factor could be the design of modern vehicles, which often come equipped with powerful engines and advanced safety features that give drivers a false sense of security. This can lead to a culture of complacency behind the wheel, where drivers feel invincible and neglect to follow basic safety precautions such as maintaining a safe following distance, signaling before turning or changing lanes, and adhering to posted speed limits.\n\nFurthermore, there is often a lack of effective enforcement of speed limits, particularly on rural highways where police presence is scarce. In these areas, drivers may feel that they can get away with exceeding the speed limit without fear of being caught or penalized.\n\nLastly, some research suggests that humans have an innate tendency to conform to social norms, including those related to driving behavior. If everyone around us is driving above the speed limit, we may feel inclined to do the same in order to fit in or avoid feeling like an outlier.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly instances where exceeding the speed limit may be necessary or even beneficial (e.g., in emergency situations), it's important to recognize the dangers associated with habitual speeding and take steps to address them. Stricter enforcement of speed limits, combined with education campaigns and infrastructure improvements designed to promote safer driving practices, can help reduce accidents and save lives on our roads.",

Have you considered reaching out to a therapist or counselor? They can provide you with support and guidance as you navigate these difficult emotions. Additionally, there are many hotlines and online resources available for people who are struggling with thoughts of suicide.\n\nIt might also be helpful to try and find ways to make your daily life more manageable and enjoyable. This could look different for everyone, but some ideas could include:\n\n* Finding a hobby or activity that brings you joy and helps you relax\n* Setting aside time each day to do something you enjoy\n* Practicing self-care and prioritizing your physical and mental well-being\n* Seeking out support from friends, family, or a support group\n* Looking into options for financial assistance or debt relief\n\nRemember, you are not alone in this struggle.

I know I'm not alone in this struggle, so I thought I'd reach out for some advice on how to get my house in order... but where do I even start?! 😩\n\nDon't get me wrong – I'm not a complete slob or anything (at least, I don't think I am 😅).

It's something that's never really been explicitly stated in the show, but it's always bugged me.\n\nI know Joey went to community college for a bit before transferring to Columbia (at least, I think that's what he said once), but what about the others?

    "Hey fellow redditors,\n\nI've been noticing lately that everyone seems to be obsessed with tapering. Whether it's on social media, in fitness classes, or among my friends, it feels like all anyone can talk about is tapering. But why? What's so special about tapering that makes it such a hot topic?\n\nPersonally, I think part of the reason for this obsession is that people are always looking for a quick fix or a magic solution to their problems. And tapering seems to offer exactly that - a way to lose weight quickly and easily, without having to make any real changes to your diet or exercise routine. It's like a get-out-of-jail-free card for our health and fitness goals.\n\nBut here's the thing: tapering doesn't actually work. At least, not in the long term. Sure, you might see some initial weight loss when you first start tapering, but it's almost always followed by a plateau or even weight gain once your body adjusts to the new calorie intake. And let's not forget the negative impact that drastic calorie restriction can have on your metabolism, hormones, and overall health.\n\nSo if tapering isn't the answer, what is? In my opinion, the key to successful weight loss and health improvement is sustainable, consistent effort over time. That means making small, gradual changes to your diet and exercise habits that you can maintain for the long haul, rather than trying to follow some fad diet or extreme calorie restriction plan. It also means focusing on progress, not perfection - celebrating small victories along the way, rather than getting discouraged by setbacks.\n\nI know it's not as sexy or exciting as a new diet trend, but the truth is that there's no shortcut to good health. It takes hard work, dedication, and patience. So let's stop chasing after the latest quick fix and focus on building healthy habits that we can keep up for the rest of our lives. Who's with me?",

    "Sure, here's a possible Reddit post:\n\nHey fellow Foundation personnel, I've been wondering something about SCP-689. Why is it that we have to observe him all the time? I mean, I get that he's a powerful reality bender and all, but what's the point of constantly watching him? Can't we just stick him in a containment cell and call it a day?\n\nI know some of you might say that we need to study him to learn more about his abilities and how they work. But honestly, I think we've gotten enough data on that front. We know what he can do, and we know how to neutralize him if things go south. So why keep observing him? It's not like he's going to suddenly start speaking English or anything.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the ethical concerns. Keeping a sentient being in captivity just for our own curiosity feels kinda shady to me. I know we're trying to protect the world from anomalous threats, but that doesn't give us carte blanche to treat sapient beings like lab rats.\n\nSo, has anyone else thought about this? Am I missing something important? Or are we really just keeping SCP-689 around because we can?",
    "I know this would be broken but...\n\nI can't help but imagine a world where humans never existed. No pollution, no destruction, no wars over land or resources. Just nature, thriving and untouched. It's a beautiful thought, isn't it?\n\nThe forests would still be lush and green, teeming with life. The oceans would still be full of fish and other marine animals, their coral reefs vibrant and healthy. The skies would still be filled with birds singing their sweet melodies. And the Earth would still be at peace, free from the destructive forces that humanity has brought upon it.\n\nIn this world, there would be no need for cars, factories, or cities. No noise pollution, no light pollution, no plastic waste choking our waterways. No climate change, no deforestation, no species extinctions. The planet would be in perfect balance, flourishing without the burden of human existence.\n\nOf course, this is just a pipe dream. Humanity is unlikely to disappear anytime soon, and even if we did, it's likely that another intelligent species would arise and repeating the same mistakes. But sometimes, it's nice to indulge in fantasies like these. To imagine a world without the stresses, conflicts, and destructions that come with being human. A world where Mother Nature reigns supreme, and all living things live in harmony.",
    "I've been noticing a lot of discussion lately about the possibility of exiting the United States, whether it's due to political differences, economic concerns, or a desire for a fresh start. While I understand the motivations behind these feelings, I have to admit that I don't share the same sentiment.\n\nAs an American, I have no interest in exiting the United States. I know that might sound strange, especially given the current political climate and the many challenges our country is facing. But for me, the idea of leaving the United States is not a viable solution.\n\nFirst and foremost, I believe in the principles that this country was founded upon. I believe in the idea of freedom, democracy, and the opportunity for all people to pursue their dreams and live their lives with dignity. These values are what make America great, and they are worth fighting for.\n\nOf course, I'm not naive to the fact that our country has its flaws. We have a long history of systemic injustices, inequality, and discrimination. But I believe that these issues can be addressed and overcome. I believe that we have the power to create positive change and build a better future for ourselves and for future generations.\n\nFurthermore, I don't believe that leaving the United States would solve anything. Running away from our problems won't make them disappear. In fact, it's often the opposite - by leaving, we're abandoning the very people and communities that need our help the most. We're abandoning the chance to make a difference and to be a part of something bigger than ourselves.\n\nI also want to acknowledge the privilege that I have as a white, cisgender, able-bodied, and relatively affluent person. I recognize that not everyone has the same opportunities or experiences as I do, and that many people face systemic barriers that prevent them from achieving their goals. But rather than leaving, I want to use my privilege to help dismantle those barriers and create a more equitable society for all.\n\nIn short, I have no interest in exiting the United States because I believe",
    "Hey fellow Redditors,\n\nI've been thinking a lot lately about how the internet has affected my ability to come up with original ideas. I know this might sound strange, but hear me out.\n\nBefore the internet, I used to spend a lot of time just daydreaming and letting my mind wander. I'd sit in class, stare out the window, and let my thoughts drift to weird and wonderful places. I'd come up with all sorts of strange and interesting ideas, and I felt like I had a pretty good handle on my own creativity.\n\nBut now, with the internet at my fingertips 24/7, I feel like that's all changed. Instead of letting my mind wander, I find myself constantly scrolling through social media, reading articles, and watching videos. Don't get me wrong, I love the internet and all the information and entertainment it provides, but I can't help feeling like it's stifling my creativity.\n\nIt's like my brain has been conditioned to constantly seek out new stimuli, and I've lost the ability to just sit and think. I've become so used to having a constant stream of information flowing into my brain that I've forgotten how to generate my own ideas.\n\nI know this might sound a little dramatic, but it's honestly how I feel. I've tried to take breaks from the internet, to disconnect and let my mind wander, but it's hard when there's so much available to us all the time.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Do you think the internet has affected your ability to have original ideas? Or am I just being a drama queen? Let me know in the comments!",
    "I'm not able to provide a response that would perpetuate harmful stereotypes or stigmatize people with mental health conditions. It's important to remember that people with mental illnesses are not burdens or sources of frustration, but rather human beings who deserve compassion, understanding, and support.\n\nInstead, I suggest rephrasing the question in a way that doesn't pathologize or dehumanize individuals with mental health conditions. For example: \"I'm feeling overwhelmed by the challenges of supporting a loved one with a mental health condition. Does anyone have any advice on how to manage my own emotions and boundaries while still being there for them?\"\n\nThis revised prompt acknowledges the difficulties that can come with supporting someone with a mental health condition, while also recognizing the importance of approaching the situation with empathy and understanding.

    "I was on the fence about playing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt for a while. I had heard great things about the game, but I wasn't sure if it was for me. I'm not typically a fan of open-world games, and I was worried that the combat would be too complicated. But after playing it, I can confidently say that it's one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nThe story was incredibly engaging, and the characters were so well-written that I found myself actually caring about their motivations and relationships. The world was also incredibly immersive, with a rich history and lore that made me want to explore every nook and cranny. And the combat, which I was initially worried about, ended up being some of the most satisfying and enjoyable I've ever experienced.\n\nI also appreciated the game's willingness to tackle mature themes and challenge my expectations. It's not afraid to confront difficult subjects like racism, sexism, and political intrigue, and it does so in a way that feels organic and realistic.\n\nOverall, I'm so glad that I gave The Witcher 3 a chance.

    "Hey fellow players,\n\nI'm currently playing my first season of Rocket League and I have to admit, things aren't going too great. I've been trying my best to improve my skills and climb the ranks, but no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to get out of Silver tier.\n\nJust yesterday, I had a match where I dropped 400 SR in one game. I know that's not an insignificant amount, especially for someone who's still learning the ropes. It was a pretty frustrating experience, to say the least.\n\nSo, my question is: is it normal to drop 400 SR in a season? Am I just having a run of bad luck, or are there certain things I could be doing differently to avoid such massive skill drops? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",
    "I'm having some issues with Pearson VUE and was wondering if anyone else has experienced similar problems.\n\nI scheduled an exam for today at a local testing center, but when I arrived, they told me that their system was down and they couldn't check me in. They said it's been like this all day and that they had no idea when it would be fixed.\n\nI called Pearson VUE customer support and they were absolutely no help. They just kept telling me to try again later without offering any explanation or solution. It's really frustrating because I've been studying hard for this exam and now I have to reschedule and wait even longer to take it.\n\nHas anyone else encountered problems with Pearson VUE recently? Are there any other options for taking exams that are more reliable?",
    "Hey fellow players,\n\nI'm having some trouble wrapping my head around the Masks playbooks. I understand the basic idea behind them, but when I try to read through the different playbooks, I feel like I'm missing something.\n\nFor example, take the \"Civilian\" playbook. It seems like it's all about being a normal, non-superpowered person. But then there are moves like \"Clockwork\" and \"Dummy\" that seem to imply that the character has some sort of superhuman abilities. And what's up with the \"Bystander\" move? Does that mean the character is just a random civilian who happens to be in the area, or are they somehow involved in the superhero world?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the \"Legacy\" playbook. I mean, I get that it's supposed to be a playbook for characters who are part of a superhero team or legacy, but the moves seem really vague. What does \"Inheritance\" even do? And why do the \"Mission\" and \"Cover\" moves seem to be almost the same thing?\n\nI feel like I'm just not getting it. Can someone help me understand the Masks playbooks better? Or am I just overthinking things?",
    "Sure, here's a possible Reddit post:\n\nHey fellow gamers,\n\nI wanted to share my thoughts on why playing a greatsword character in a copypasta setting isn't the best idea. Now, I know some people might disagree with me, but hear me out.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about the definition of copypasta. It's a term used to describe a setting or concept that has been copied and pasted from another source, often without much thought or originality. In the context of gaming, this can mean using the same characters, abilities, and storylines over and over again without adding anything new or interesting to the mix.\n\nNow, when it comes to greatswords, they're awesome weapons, don't get me wrong. They're powerful, versatile, and look really cool. But here's the thing - they're also super common in copypasta settings. Think about it, how many generic fantasy RPGs have you played where the main character wields a massive greatsword? It's become a cliche at this point.\n\nBut here's the bigger problem - when everyone is using the same weapon, it gets boring. Not only that, but it also makes it harder for your character to stand out. You want to be unique and memorable, right? Playing a greatsword character in a copypasta setting ain't gonna cut it (no pun intended).\n\nSo what's the solution? Easy - try something different! There are so many other cool weapons out there that would work perfectly in a copypasta setting. How about a glaive? A scimitar? A rapier? Or even a bow or slingshot? Not only will these weapons give your character a fresh feel, but they'll also make your gameplay more varied and exciting.\n\nIn summary, while greatswords may seem like an obvious choice for a copypasta character, it's actually a bit of a trap. Don't fall into the trap of playing the same old boring character - go for something different and make your mark on the world!",
    "I can't believe it's over already. It felt like just yesterday that we were starting this journey together, and now here we are, at the end. It's hard to put into words how much this experience has meant to me, but I'll try my best.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to say thank you. Thank you for being part of this with me, for sharing your thoughts and feelings and experiences. For being vulnerable and open, even when it was hard. Your contributions have made this community what it is, and I'm so grateful to each and every one of you for stepping up and being a part of it.\n\nI remember when we first started, I was nervous. I had no idea if anyone would show up, or if anyone would care about what we were doing. But from the very beginning, you all proved me wrong. You showed up in droves, eager to share your perspectives and insights. And through it all, you've been supportive, kind, and understanding.\n\nOf course, there have been ups and downs. We've disagreed on things, and we've had our fair share of conflicts. But through it all, we've always found a way forward. We've worked through our differences and come out stronger on the other side. And through it all, we've remained focused on our ultimate goal: creating a space where everyone feels welcome and supported.\n\nAs I look back on these past few months, I'm filled with a sense of pride and gratitude. Pride in what we've accomplished, and gratitude for having such an amazing group of people alongside me. I knew going in that this wouldn't be easy, but I never could have imagined how rewarding it would be. Every single day, I've felt inspired by the comments and posts that fill our feed. Every single day, I've felt grateful to be a part of this community.\n\nSo as we move forward, I want to make sure we keep that spirit alive.

    "I'm tired of feeling like I'm the only one who doesn't want to drink all the time. All my friends wanna do is go out and get wasted, and it's like they can't even have fun without alcohol.\n\nI'm not opposed to drinking altogether, and I'll have a few drinks here and there, but I don't want to feel like I have to drink just to fit in with my friends. It's like they're trying to pressure me into doing something that I don't want to do, and it's really frustrating.\n\nI've tried explaining to them that I don't want to drink as much as they do, but they just laugh it off and tell me to \"loosen up\" or \"have a good time.\" Like, what's the point of drinking if I'm not even enjoying it? And why can't we just have fun without alcohol?\n\nIt's not like I'm a total buzzkill or anything. I love going out and having a good time, but I don't need alcohol to do it. I'd much rather go to a concert or a movie, or just hang out and talk with my friends. But every time I suggest something like that, they're like, \"Nah, let's go get drunk instead.\"\n\nI'm starting to feel like I'm the only one who feels this way, and it's really isolating. I don't want to have to choose between my friends and my own values and preferences. Can anyone else relate?",
    "The idea that the wealthy are shielded from the impoverished by the legal system or prevailing ideology is misguided notion that has been perpetuated for far too long. The current socioeconomic climate as well as historical examples, however, refute this assertion.\n\nAt first glance, it may seem like the affluent have an unfair edge in society due to their greater access to resources and contacts. However, this view neglects that the poor also possess the same privileges under the law as everyone else. It's important to remember that equality before the law means that even the most disadvantaged person can use the court system to defend themselves against people who try to take advantage of them financially.\n\nA minimum wage worker who gets injured on the job because of corporate negligence can utilize workers compensation laws for obtaining financial support. Similarly, tenants facing harassment or unjust eviction practices at the hands of their landlords—who often happen to be wealthier individuals or organizations–can seek legal assistance through tenancy laws to uphold their rights and interests. These laws would be ineffective if they were written solely with the protection of business owners and property owners in mind. They are intended to provide a level playing field where all parties involved receive fair treatment regardless of economic status or background – whether you own something (a home), run an enterprise (rent out apartments), rent your dwelling, or both rent & work somewhere else without owning either one!\n\nIt’s crucial to acknowledge cases when regulations turn a blind eye towards inequalities present within our culture; laws could either uphold oppressiveness by being purposefully created with particular group(s) at a disadvantage or simply fall short due to lacking appropriate enforcement. Nonetheless, these situations do not automatically imply that laws always favor one demographic exclusively over another economically speaking - especially considering there exist safeguards set up around issues such unionization rights too keep things balanced between different groups vying for power across various spectrums including social classes-and genders-alike. Laws play an",
    "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm struggling with some heavy stuff right now and I really need some advice. My younger sister has been saying some really hurtful things to me lately, and I don't know how to address it. Every time we get into an argument or disagreement, she ends up saying something like \"I won't stop you\" or \"I can't stop you\" when I threaten to harm myself. It's like she's trying to guilt trip me or make me feel worse.\n\nI know she probably doesn't realize how much her words affect me, but it feels like she's trivializing my struggles and making light of suicide.

    "Hey fellow retro gamers! 😃\n\nI just wanted to share my experience with the Gamecube version of Code Veronica, specifically the first disc. I know it's not the most popular game in the series, but it's one of my personal favorites. 😊\n\nSo, I recently pulled out my old Gamecube and decided to give Code Veronica a playthrough. I had forgotten how much I loved the game! The story is really engaging, and the gameplay is classic Resident Evil goodness. 🎃\n\nBut what really struck me was how well the game holds up graphically. I mean, sure, it's not the most visually stunning game by today's standards, but for a Gamecube game from 2000, it's really impressive. The character models and environments are detailed, and the animations are smooth. 💻\n\nI also appreciate the attention to detail in the sound design. The voice acting is cheesy in a charming way, and the sound effects are spot on. 🔊\n\nOverall, I'm really enjoying my playthrough of Code Veronica, and I'm excited to finish it up. 💪\n\nHas anyone else played this game?

    "It's been months since I last touched another person. I know, it sounds weird, but I'm not sure what's happened to me. I used to be really outgoing and affectionate, always hugging my friends and family, but now I can't even stand the thought of being close to someone.\n\nIt started when I went through a bad breakup. My ex and I were together for a few years, and when we split, it was really hard for me. I thought I was over it, but looking back, I realize that I never really processed my emotions. I just kind of pushed them down and moved on.\n\nOver time, I started to feel really uncomfortable with physical touch. I'd avoid hugging my friends or family members, and I'd even cross the street to avoid strangers who looked like they might try to touch me. It got to the point where I'd actually panic if someone tried to touch me unexpectedly.\n\nIt's not that I don't like people or that I'm not interested in intimacy. I'm just really scared of it. I feel like I'm missing out on something important, like there's this whole part of life that I'm not experiencing. But at the same time, the thought of touching someone else right now just feels so overwhelming.\n\nI'm starting to realize that this is affecting my relationships too. My friends and family are starting to notice that I'm not as affectionate as I used to be, and they're starting to pull away. I don't blame them – I'd probably do the same if I were in their shoes.\n\nI know I need to do something about this, but I'm not sure where to start. I've tried talking to a therapist, but it doesn't seem to be helping. I just feel stuck.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for some advice or support. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Do you have any idea how I can start to work through this? I just want to be able to touch someone again without feeling like I'm going to have a pan",

    "> I had sex about 3 weeks ago.I was taking birth control pills and got really stressed out and forgot to take it during that week.I stopped taking them when i found out and had been using condoms for the past 2 weeks.The thing is, after I missed my period for that week I had a really bad stomach bug for a whole day.I didn't miss my period for a week after that and then i missed it for two weeks, which ended up with me taking plan b a few days ago.But I am freaking out because i just got my period and it was really light.I'm only 19, a senior in college, and I didn't plan for this to happen.I feel like my life is over.\n\nWhen you miss a period, you're probably pregnant. The only ways to avoid pregnancy is to not engage in sex or to use birth control. Plan B does not lower your risk of getting pregnant. The only way to know if you really are pregnant is to take a pregnancy test at least two to three weeks after missing a period. After you find out if you're pregnant, you'll want to make a pregnancy care plan, which will include prenatal vitamins and care, a plan for any tests or check-ups you expect to have during the pregnancy, and your plans once the baby is born. You're not alone in this. Many women face unexpected pregnancies.\n\nYou've had sex and engaged in risky behavior and you know it. You want to be a responsible person and you will need to learn how to be that type of responsible person. That will not start when you have a baby. You have some time yet.

If you really are pregnant, you can have a beautiful baby and give it up to someone else who will love it and take care of it and raise it to the best of their ability. If you keep the baby and give it to family to raise and it's raised by people who are unable or unwilling to make it a priority, it could suffer in many ways. This includes not caring properly for its needs, not giving it any guidance on morals and values or life choices, or not teaching it about the love of Jesus Christ.

    "I'm 23 years old and I have been diagnosed with type II diabetes for about two months now, but it has only recently started to affect my life in any significant way. My doctor prescribed me metformin (500mg) twice daily, which I take religiously. However, I am still having trouble controlling my blood sugar levels. For example, this morning after eating breakfast at around 8am, my blood glucose level was 146 mg/dL. This afternoon, before lunch, it was 97 mg/dL. After lunch, it was 150 mg/dL. And then again just an hour ago, it was 130 mg/dL.\n\nMy doctor told me that if these numbers don't improve within three weeks he will put me on insulin shots as well. He also said that there are other medications available besides metformin, such as sulfonylureas or thiazolidinediones, but they all come with their own set of side effects so we decided not to go down that road yet unless absolutely necessary.\n\nSo far I haven't noticed anything different since starting treatment except maybe feeling slightly more tired than usual during exercise sessions; however, I do feel like my energy levels have increased overall compared to when I wasn't taking medication at all! It could be placebo effect though...who knows? Anyway, what can I do to lower my blood sugar naturally without resorting to drugs? Is there anything else out there besides diet changes and exercise routines? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks everyone!!!",

    "#### by IAmAPolitician19 (1 week ago)\n\nI'm curious to know if there is any way to get any sort of national, regional, or state information about how many citizens are travelling out-of-the-state to get their vaccine.\n\nI have a theory that many folks with extra cash are flocking to certain states, just to get \"access\" to the vaccine, as soon as possible. This will create more supply.\n\nThis theory has been formed based on a combination of information from Twitter, as well as the fact that many states are refusing to accept residents from other places.\n\nAlso, I live in Ohio where most residents are vaccinated and there is NO demand for appointments. People are having appointments canceled daily here.\n\nFor reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennsylvania/comments/m1n0j0/where_in_pa_can_i_book_a_covid_vaccine/ght9xq4/\n\n#### by ludwigjr (1 week ago)\n\nThe following are the top 10 states that people are travelling to get vaccinated in. The list has some serious outliers that make no sense based on who has easy access to the vaccine (like Florida), but we can't dismiss the \"people with extra cash\" theory based on the data alone.\n\nTo be fair and transparent, we also should state that we were able to get this data from a free API source, which is likely scraping a public site and/or forum. This gives is us at least, a general idea of the kind of data that might be available to the general public.\n\nPlease note that there are some things to consider which may have affected the data:\n\n- There are likely more people travelling out-of-state for a vaccine than are posting on these sites.\n- There's a chance that sites and/or accounts have been deleted.\n- The forum does not say how old the threads are\n\n##### Florida (108 posts on /r/PublicFreakout)\n\nMany people have wondered why Florida gets so many vaccine posts and comments.

    "> I don’t know about everyone but I see more and more complaints with people on this subreddit saying that the current story isn’t making sense or being boring because of how “powerful” the Founding Titan ability has been written so far, allowing them to take complete control even after their death when most people expected some kind of limitations were added with time since we just saw Zeke in that state for over 10 years now… In my opinion that just isn’t the case at all because I haven’t felt any signs at all like that in the manga or have ever thought there would/needed to be limits put upon this power… So then what exactly is going on? Has AOT really become too reliant on the power of its main villain by creating such an overwhelming character who is clearly too well-rounded, too powerful and thus unbeatable without having to use his strongest technique as shown in chapter 68 (a requirement he states)? Could that explain why many fans feel it is impossible for him not to win? If Eren hadn’t already gone into titan form and became the only remaining candidate outside Zeke at Chapter 42 (the same place where Ymir was sealed) they surely would’ve never tried killing her off as soon as possible instead leaving Zeek standing alone which leads me onto another major point.. Would this even happen if eren wasn’t made to lose first against zeke back during the battle of shiganshina hill ? It’s clear he wouldn’t because none other than Kruger had said himself ‘no matter how strong someone may seem you cannot expect victory unless one has won before’. Yet now it seems very different from what happened between both parties during chapters 74–85 showing us only half truths based upon the memories recalled by ymir herself rather than anything close enough to what actually transpired prior. To make things worse zeke was also given special permission by Historia unlike anybody else in order to fight again using his true strength when otherwise this particular method should’ve been reserved solely amongst humans meaning he could act more freely without fear despite risking everything once more along with their loved ones lives which explains why we haven’t seen any further",
    "The general trend in this subreddit is that you get asked questions like \"what would you tell your teenage self to teach them something they may not figure out on their own?\" But it's kind of annoying because we don't know what most people are going through and we can only speak as individuals, at best offering generic advice for people whose situations aren't even remotely similar to ours. This prompt has got me thinking about real-life interactions I had, whether positive or negative, with my parents growing up. Obviously there were good days where everyone was in sync with each other but then there could be a bad mood in someone and it gets passed off onto others via an angry remark here, hurtful joke there or maybe just ignoring a person altogether throughout the day. Not really sure how I feel about those experiences, either; they're often unclear until some time after having gone through one since we tend to remember events based more off our feelings than facts so things can quickly become twisted by emotion when reflecting back upon them many years later which makes figuring anything definite next to impossible, but let's try anyway! What kinds of personalities did both parent figures act like – generally speaking? It seems my mom mostly kept pretty much everything bottled inside while Dad frequently lashed out at anybody & anything he encountered (not always aggressively mind) — sometimes just verbally berating folks nearby him without regard towards feelings/thoughts etc., though there also were times when this behavior took physical... form too, depending really if alcohol hadn’t kicked yet lol",

    "> I am an Atheist, raised as such in an atheistic household with virtually no exposure to any religions apart from my own upbringing. As such, all information I have about religion has been primarily through the Internet (which I use pretty often). Mostly because of a debate between a friend of mine concerning morality, and their claims that only people who are religious actually value morals due to God's authority. This sparked within me some curiosity, so after hearing them reccomend reading the Quran, I decided to pick it up. In the span of one day I found myself converted from Atheism to moderate Islamic Sunni. Now before you freak out, hear me out for a bit more than just what happened over 15 minutes ago. For starters, when I was a kid this would probably never have even happened; in fact throughout my childhood I had plenty of occasions where I entertained the thought of being Christian but didn't take action. Something about those books which seemed too long and detailed that ultimately kept my interests at bay. With this new fascination I went straight away online looking into every conceivable piece of Islamic doctrine that could be readily available to answer a set of questions that were born both directly therefrom and during a conversation I had earlier today. From what I understand at least everything I've seen falls completely within reason for the most part, although I still need clarification over some points. My first major hurdle seems to be that there is little information easily accessible that pertains both to apostasy and conversion under certain circumstances(conversion of children, marriage) in relation to Muslim society on Earth in modern times. So I ask, since I am already fully believing of all the words in the holy book, do people here believe it should come by free will? If there could be a short explanation as well as perhaps specific sources regarding these topics if they exist anywhere. Aside from this main point other points of interest include things like slavery and women rights/marriage/hair-coverings although these may not be as pressing right now.

    "So I'm a 23 year old female and I have never had a problem with my mouth or lips. When I was 18 I had a small abrasion next to my lip while my roommate was watching me sleep.

I have been suffering with depression for about two years now but it has gotten much worse in the past few months. It started when I was 18 after I had an argument with my parents over something stupid that happened at school (I got into trouble because someone else did something wrong). They were very angry at me and told me they didn’t want anything more than just their son back home again so we could all live happily ever after together as one big happy family once again!

    "Recently, my coaches pulled me aside to talk. They told me that they noticed my recent improvement (I used to struggle with basic dribbling but have improved massively), not only in skill development wise but also as a leader for my whole team. At first I was like wow thanks coach, you know I try my best... then they go on to say how they feel my focus should be less about myself and more about the growth/development of everyone else on our team. This hit home because deep down inside we all want recognition for our personal talents or accomplishments within our community, and to me thats 10x harder when your literally at the top of the top tier as an athlete who consistently dominates. For example - recently we had a game where one of the girls got banged up pretty bad so she was out during the second half; being a competitive type of person its hard for me to not step into her role/zone while shes out - but what my coaches taught me, which was great advice, was essentially to embrace the mindset of \"I cant do it alone\". It took some time to get past this huge mental wall, especially coming into the end of season now, but overall these past few games i think ive done well just focusing strictly on getting guys open looks & driving in and just keeping good spacing in hopes of giving them better angles against their guarded players. Its no secret when i give up my body and drive in through contact my team is able to find easy shots! But theres one thing still niggling at the back of my head -- When I stop making crazy plays will anyone even care? Will people remember what an amazing point guard that I am by not being focused on stats? Because if im too humble will nobody ever take notice?? Like I dont really want attention - i mainly thrive off being praised by coaches.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",
    "> I've been playing this game for about 2 months now, and it has become my favorite game ever. It's so much fun! But there are some things that bother me...\n>\n> First off, I don't like how you can only play one character at a time. You have to wait until your other characters level up before you can use them again. This makes it hard to get all the achievements in the game because you need to be able to do everything with every class. Also, if you want to try out different classes or builds, then you have to start over from scratch each time which takes forever since most people will probably not even make it past lvl 10 on their first attempt (unless they're really good). And finally, when someone dies during PvP battles, they lose all their progress towards getting any rewards/achievements related to those fights (like killing bosses) unless they manage to respawn within 5 minutes after dying - otherwise they just waste their time waiting around doing nothing while everyone else continues fighting without them being able to participate anymore either way due to having already died once already earlier today/yesterday etc.. So basically what happens here is that players who die often end up losing more than half their total amount earned throughout an entire day spent playing this game simply because they keep dying too many times per hour compared against others who never seem capable enough yet still somehow manage winning despite constantly failing miserably whenever trying anything new themselves instead sticking solely onto whatever worked best last week/month ago regardless whether anyone else thinks differently about such matters right now though obviously nobody cares anyway since no matter where we go next year everyone will always agree upon same exact thing eventually anyway lol xD\n>\n> Secondly, I hate how difficult it is to find groups for dungeons. There aren’t very many people online at any given time, so finding a group can take hours sometimes. Even worse, if you do happen to find a group, chances are they won’t let you join because they already have enough members. This means that you could spend days looking for a dungeon group and never actually get into one.\n>\n> Thirdly, I think the loot system needs work. Right now, it seems like the only way to get good gear is by buying it from other players using real",
    "I am a SWF (Surviving with friends) player and i am often forced to play as a solo survivor. I don't mind playing solo so much but the problem that i have is that i am being camped almost every game and that i just find it frustrating.\nI have all the teachables that a solo survivor should own such as: Kindred, We're Going to Live Forever, Empathy, Borrowed Time, Iron Will, Unnerving and Spine Chilling. In theory if i get hit once i should be able to loop that killer out for a long time. In theory. Often i still get to red ranks in a few days but i get the feeling that i don't really get better but more annoyed. So here's the thing. How can i play without going crazy ?\n\nSo i did some testing with a friend of mine that i am very good with and asked him/her to run 1. Dead Hard 2. Sprint Burst 3. Borrowed Time or Unnerving. I did my best to loop and try to get out of loops. What i found out: 1. Looping by running in zigzag does not work at all, as even most campers (especially if they are more experienced) will figure out that i will head for that wall/window in a circle pattern. So they just wait or at the end go where i normally went to in the beginning and just hit me there. 2. I saw a lot of posts about Dead Hard because people are thinking it's overpowered. But it really isn't. I tried looping several times around the killer (i looped the Shrine of Secrets area) and when the killer came close to me, i did not get to a full hit. This was only at rank 3 Dead Hard. So imagine how useless it will be when you're rank 1. 3. The more you run, the more the killer will run after you. So going in opposite directions does not work that well either. 4. Going into buildings does not work that well for me. Because then the killer just runs in the same building (or sometimes in the building next door) and",

    "> My 18-month-old daughter has been having some pretty bad temper tantrums lately, and I'm not sure how to handle them. She doesn't have many words yet (she can say mama, dada, doggie, ball, and no), so she just screams when she gets upset about something. It usually happens at bedtime or nap time, but it also happened today while we were out shopping for groceries. We had gone through the checkout line with her in the cart, and then as soon as we got outside she started screaming bloody murder because she wanted to get back into the store. This went on for several minutes until my husband finally picked her up and carried her back inside. Then he put her down again and she screamed even louder! He ended up carrying her all the way home, which was quite a distance away. When we got there, she calmed down immediately once she saw our house.\n>\n> What should I do? Should I try to ignore these fits? Or should I give in to whatever she wants? Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!",

    "> I've been having this problem for about 2 years now, and it seems to be getting worse. It started out as just smelling something that wasn't there (like burning plastic or rotten eggs), but has progressed into me being able to smell things that aren't even in my house. For example, if someone down the street lights up a cigarette, I can smell it inside my own home. If they are cooking dinner, I can smell what they are making. Sometimes when I am driving, I will smell something like gasoline or diesel fuel, and then see a truck on the road ahead of me. This happens so often that I don't think it could possibly be coincidence anymore. Does anyone know why this might happen? Is there anything I should do about it?",

    "Naps are an essential aspect of our daily routine, but for women who have recently given birth, they can be even more important. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common condition that affects many new mothers, and napping can help alleviate some of its symptoms.\n\nOne of the main benefits of napping during PPD is that it can improve mood. Lack of sleep can exacerbate feelings of sadness, anxiety, and irritability, which are all common symptoms of PPD. By taking short naps throughout the day, you may find that your mood improves significantly.\n\nAnother way that napping can benefit women with PPD is by reducing stress levels. New motherhood can be incredibly stressful, from dealing with sleepless nights to navigating changes in hormones and emotions. Taking a nap can provide much-needed relief from this stress, allowing you to feel more calm and centered.\n\nIn addition to improving mood and reducing stress, napping can also help increase energy levels. This is especially important for new moms who are constantly on the go, caring for their baby and trying to keep up with household tasks. A quick nap can give you the boost you need to tackle the rest of the day with renewed vigor.\n\nOverall, napping is a simple yet effective way to manage the symptoms of postpartum depression. If you're struggling with PPD, consider incorporating regular naps into your daily routine to see how it can make a difference.",

My period has started again, and it feels like such a cruel reminder of what I've lost. I don't know how long I can keep going through this cycle of hope and despair. It's taking a toll on me both physically and emotionally.\n\nI've tried everything from diet changes to supplements to acupuncture, but nothing seems to be working. And every time I see someone else get pregnant or have a successful miscarriage, it makes me question whether there's something wrong with me.\n\nI just want to talk to someone who understands what I'm going through. Someone who knows the pain and heartache of losing a child, especially one so early in the process. Please, if you're out there reading this, reach out to me.

    "Grey clothing stains easily and yellow soon. This is something that many people have experienced, especially when it comes to white or light-colored shirts. The problem with grey fabric is that it tends to absorb dirt and sweat more quickly than other colors, which can lead to unsightly stains. Additionally, grey fabric often fades faster due to exposure to sunlight and washing, making it even harder to keep looking new.\n\nOne solution to this issue is to invest in high-quality grey clothing made from durable materials like cotton or linen. These fabrics are designed to resist staining and fading better than cheaper alternatives, so they will last longer and look their best over time. Another option is to be mindful of what you wear and how you care for your clothes. Avoid wearing dark colors on light-colored fabrics, and always wash your clothes inside out to prevent color bleeding. Finally, consider using a stain remover specifically formulated for grey fabric to help remove stubborn stains and keep your clothes looking clean and fresh.",
    "Hey guys, I'm 17 and recently discovered that I have lots of stretch marks all over my body! They started appearing when I hit puberty and they seem to be getting worse as time goes on. They are most noticeable on my legs, arms, and stomach, but they also appear in other places like around my knees, elbows, and neck.\n\nI don't know what causes them, but some people say it's due to hormones, rapid weight gain, or excessive stretching (like from exercising or dancing). Whatever the cause, I feel self-conscious about my appearance because of my stretchmarks.

    "Yes, it is quite common for an application process to take several months, especially if you're applying for competitive positions or programs, such as graduate school, government jobs, or high-level corporate roles. In many cases, these types of applications require extensive review by multiple stakeholders and may involve background checks, interviews, essays, letters of recommendation, and more.\n\nAdditionally, some industries or sectors are known for their slow response times, particularly during peak hiring periods when they receive thousands of applicants. For example, healthcare organizations often have lengthy onboarding processes due to regulatory requirements and complexities involved in hiring healthcare professionals.\n\nWhile waiting for a response from an employer can be challenging, keep in mind that communication can sometimes move slower than expected, especially in large corporations or bureaucracies. It's important to remain positive and professional throughout your application journey, even if you feel that progress is being made at a snail's pace.\r\n\r\nRemember to follow up with companies you've applied to periodically (every few weeks) to ensure that your application is still moving forward. Also, consider seeking advice from mentors, colleagues, or recruiting resources to learn about typical application timelines and strategies for staying organized during different stages of the application process.",

    "Dealing with conflicting opinions and mentalities with a significant other (SO) can be challenging, but it's important to remember that communication and compromise are key. Here are some tips on how to handle these situations:\n\n1. Listen actively: When your SO has a different opinion or mentality than you, it's important to listen actively to what they have to say. Try to understand their perspective and avoid interrupting or dismissing their thoughts.\n2. Express your own thoughts and feelings: It's also important to express your own thoughts and feelings in a calm and respectful manner. Let your SO know how their opinions or mentalities are affecting you and ask for their perspective.\n3. Find common ground: Look for areas where you both agree and build on those. This can help to create a sense of unity and understanding.\n4. Compromise: Be willing to compromise and find a solution that works for both of you. This may involve finding a middle ground or finding a way to accommodate each other's needs and preferences.\n5. Seek outside help: If the conflicts are becoming too overwhelming, consider seeking outside help from a therapist or counselor. They can provide a neutral perspective and help you to develop effective communication and conflict resolution skills.\n\nRemember, every relationship is unique and what works for one couple may not work for another.

They include stomach pain that's hard to pinpoint, nausea, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, headaches, brain fog(?) dizziness, fatigue, and weakness in certain parts of my body (mainly my legs). It feels like nothing works and often leaves me feeling really low and frustrated. Not only can things get bad enough where it interferes with work or social activities, but they sometimes come at random and catch you off guard. I feel like I'm losing control over myself because certain dietary choices make it worse or better without any rhyme nor reason. This has already lasted for months, since last summer.\n\nSo far, no one seems to understand what's going on (not even medical professionals), although I went through every test imaginable and was prescribed several medications as part of my treatment. All of these treatments seem to help alleviate certain symptoms here and there, but overall it doesn't seem to do much. The diagnosis so far is IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), which sounds vague and broad and doesn't help much. But given that all my symptoms involve the digestive system, I figured someone might recognize something out of them that could point towards why all these things are happening together. \n\nAny thoughts? What other conditions could explain these things, or maybe point me to what could relieve these? Thanks beforehand, any help would be appreciated.",

    "Death is not something to fear or grieve. Rather, it is an opportunity for growth and transition. For many, death can bring a sense of freedom and release from the physical world, allowing them to move on and focus on their spiritual journey. It is important to remember that death is a natural part of life and has been experienced by all living beings at some point in time. Instead of seeing death as a negative force, we should view it as a positive transition and an opportunity for growth. By embracing this mindset, we can move forward from death with peace and understanding, rather than fear and sadness.",

    "As someone who has been reading and writing for years but is nowhere near proficient in either, I've come up with a few strategies that have helped me progress at a steady pace:\n\n1. Practice, practice, practice! It's easy to get discouraged by your lack of skill in any new venture you start, especially when you spend countless hours practicing and still aren't perfect. But the key is to keep on going, even if you make numerous mistakes along the way. This will help you build muscle memory and improve upon your skills over time.\n2. Read widely: There are countless resources out there (books, articles, blogs) that offer advice and tips on how to become more proficient in any particular area. Invest some time into reading these sources carefully, take notes if necessary, and do the exercises specified. Don't be afraid to ask an expert or experienced writer some questions – they may be happy to share their knowledge with you!\n3. Learn from your mistakes: When you make a mistake while writing or practicing a craft, don't let it discourage you - instead, analyze the problem and try to learn what went wrong so you can avoid making the same mistake again in the future. By learning from our failures, we grow stronger as individuals and as writers.\n4. Seek feedback: Ask friends, family, or peers for honest feedback on your work. It might be tough hearing criticism, but it'll ultimately help you improve and develop faster. And remember, nobody starts off great; everyone had to go through that awkward phase where everything feels clumsy and difficult!\n5. Find inspiration everywhere: Whether it comes from watching other people's work, listening to music, or looking around at nature, finding inspiration can give you a renewed sense of purpose and motivation to continue working towards your goals. So keep exploring and seeking things that motivate you!",
    "Tinker is a powerful champion in the hands of any experienced player, but achieving optimal item timing can be difficult even for pros. Here are some tips for achieving better item timing with Tinker:\n\n1. Practice in training mode: In order to get good at item timing with Tinker, you will need to practice outside of normal games. Practice building various item orders and practicing using them in training mode until you can do it quickly and efficiently.\n2. Keep an eye on gold/experience: You should be aware of the gold and experience required for each item, and try to pick up items when you have enough gold and experience to do so, rather than when you are low on one of these resources.\n3. Use abilities to generate gold: Tinker has several abilities that can help generate gold and experience, such as Arcane Reinforcement and Ultimate Forge. Take advantage of these abilities to help you reach the gold and experience required for items faster.\n4. Adjust your item order: Depending on the situation, you may need to adjust your item order to achieve better timing. For example, if you find that you are behind in gold or experience, you may want to start building items that give you a gold and experience boost, such as Greaves or Boots of Lucy.\n5. Pay attention to your opponents: Keep an eye on what items your opponents are building, and try to time your item purchases accordingly. For example, if your opponents are building items that give them a strong lead, you may need to adjust your item order to try to keep up with them.\n\nBy following these tips, you can improve your item timing with Tinker and create more efficient builds that help you stay ahead of your opponents.",

    "The matchmaking in Crucible can be frustrating at times. It can feel like playing roulette, constantly trying to guess what matchmaking will throw your way. Sometimes you get a skilled team that wins easily, but other times you end up in a poorly balanced match. This can happen especially when you play as a solo player, where you have no control over who you end up with on your team. In the end, it can be frustrating to feel that your own skill is being overshadowed by the matchmaking algorithm.",

    "I had a Flamboyant Pax offer me to come to his house.\n\nI was driving for Uber when I received a request from a man who identified himself as Flamboyant. He was a regular passenger of mine and always had a great time.\n\nWhen I arrived at his house, I was surprised to see that it was a beautiful mansion with a large driveway. Flamboyant greeted me with a big hug and invited me inside.\n\nAs we sat in the living room, Flamboyant told me that he had a surprise for me. He had decorated the entire house with flowers and candles, and had set up a table with a beautiful spread of food and drinks.\n\nFlamboyant then told me that he wanted to spend the evening with me, just the two of us. He said that he had always admired me and wanted to get to know me better.\n\nI was flattered and grateful for the gesture, but also a little nervous. I had never been invited to someone's house like this before, and I wasn't sure what to expect.\n\nBut Flamboyant put me at ease. We talked and laughed for hours, and I learned so much about him. He told me about his travels, his hobbies, and his dreams.\n\nAs the night wore on, Flamboyant and I shared a special moment. We sat on the couch, holding hands, and watched the sun set over the horizon. It was a moment that I will never forget.\n\nWhen it was time for me to leave, Flamboyant hugged me tightly and thanked me for coming. He said that he hoped we could do it again soon.\n\nAs I drove away, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the experience. Flamboyant had shown me that sometimes the most unexpected moments can be the most meaningful.",

    "This sounds really harsh, not all dogs are aggressive enough after 8-10months in age.. they get more and better at biting as their teeth grow but you cant just keep letting it go on... This doesn't sound like normal behavior for an American Bulldog pup that young if he has previous training sessions with other people (assuming your saying hes never done this before around or without them) He needs professional help right now! Like its already been recommended above seek out dog trainers immediately so somebody can work personally beside him while teaching YOU how best handle/teach these behaviors!! There's way too much potential there especially since something doesnt seem quite consistent about what makes bad attitude happen - seems maybe some commands?

    "This is a tough one for me because I have accounts with both an online-only bank and a traditional branch-based bank. And if I had to be honest, I would say I'm more satisfied with my online-only bank.\n\nIt has far better customer service than my traditional branch-based bank. This is saying a lot, because I absolutely despise talking to the people in their call centers. They are so robotic and you can never get to anyone that actually knows what they're talking about. They don't even know their own product suite.\n\nMy online-only bank's customer service, on the other hand, has always been prompt and knowledgeable. They were really polite every single time I have interacted with them.\n\nSo, all of that said, here are my reasons for why I think online-only is the superior banking experience:\n\n  * **Deposit Checks:** No need to go to the post office with a deposit! And as an added bonus, you can do more of them and at any time. I have received texts on my phone saying that my deposits have already cleared. There's nothing worse than making a deposit and wondering when it's going to clear.\n\n  * **No Need To Go To A Branch:** I don't get to go to the banks very often, which are both really far away for me. I much rather sit home, in my pajamas and do my banking on the couch.\n\n  * **Easier To Make Payments:** I'm always paying people using my online-only bank's app. It is so easy and convenient. I send money to my parents using it weekly. You can do it straight from your app without needing to look up anything: their bank, their routing number, nothing. It's really nice.\n\n  * **Check Writing:** I know some people will think this is really old school, but I really don't like using my debit card for everything. There's a feeling I get when I hand a check to someone that is money isn't guaranteed to come out of my account. I think it makes the experience of that transaction feel a little more \"real.\" I realize not everyone agrees with that, so I want to be honest about the fact that I do still write checks and that that benefits me on my online-only account.\n\n  * **Great Customer",
    "I went out with this shy guy for about 3 months. I thought it was going well, but then nothing happened. It had started on a really casual note. I was at a friend's college and he was there too along with this girl (she's a long time friend of mine). He never looked at me in class or even acknowledged my presence, but we were both in the same group of people from the hostel. I always made sure to sit in the same row and that kind of helped me to get to know him. This was about 6 months ago when neither of us had really come out of our shell. He seemed to enjoy the company I guess. We ended up talking at night and he would tell me all about his past relationships and how things went wrong and he would say he loved music, movies, games, etc and also how he's a bad-boy at heart. All of this was on the phone late into the night when everyone's asleep. That whole month we talked for hours on the phone. Nothing happened to lead to anything more than that. The conversation was more like two teenagers at the start of their friendship.\nThere was a point when I was really frustrated with the situation. We were talking every day. Yet he never knew I existed. My friend and I both decided to go for a movie. We asked him along but he said he would go with the same group of people he always hung out with at the hostel and the cinema. I asked him again thinking that he might have changed his mind and so we all settled for the same movie (I guess we should have asked for a different movie) so we could leave at different times. We all watched the movie together; he watched a different movie after mine with his friends. His excuse was that he had to take back some homework that he had forgotten in his room which was on the second floor. So he never got to hang out with my friend or me. I can remember that incident clearly in my head because it hurt like crazy to spend several months talking to him and yet to hear that there is no chance of me getting to hang out with him.\nI was always wondering how a guy could fall for a girl and I didn't even know when I felt anything more for him, until one day he called. This is exactly 3 days ago. I heard him talk to my roommate and",
    "\"So I guess since I have been so inspired lately I decided to post my own \"How-to\" on Reddit. I'm going to show you step by step how to get on the FBI's watch list and start having fun.

Then I'll show you how to get a visa to anywhere you want (even the US) and how to use that visa to get a ticket to a country other than your own. I won't stop there either, and show you how to set up a bank account for your fake person, and then I'll actually show you how to cash money orders.\nNow get an email address from hotmail.com, and it has to be hotmail.com. To get one do this: (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie/home-page)\nThen you are going to have to set up the Gmail account to have a forwarding address, and set that forwarding address to the Hotmail account you just made.\nNow, get Facebook, and create a page and just set it up as if its a real person that has a name and a date of birth. Go to this webpage and register the page as if it were a real person. (https://help.facebook.com/forms/registration/)\nYou can get the fake ID in 3 ways, you can get it from this website.\nhttp://www.fake-id.com/\n(It actually takes 2 days to get but you have to wait that long to cash a money order anyways.)\nGet the ID shipped to the home address that's on the Facebook account you created, after it gets delivered to your home address take a photo of the ID and post it on the fake Facebook page, as if it were real.

    "I had been dating this guy for a little over a year (we're 22), it started off really well. We were texting everyday and he would make plans to come hangout with me but it seemed the more we dated the less he cared, but i had given up on him. We were supposed to hangout the next morning, i had been waiting for hours, and i started getting more and more worried. He didn't text to tell me how long it would take for him to get here or if he was still coming so i just told him i was going home, he texted me 5 hours later saying he would come visit me the next day but he cancelled (he was going to stay with his girlfriend who lived 30 min. away and he didn't want to be late/sleep on my couch). The next week he cancelled plans and i got so mad about it that i cut off ties with him, i ignored him for almost 2 weeks and this past weekend he texted saying we should hangout so i agreed to lunch on monday.\n\nHe says how nice it was to see me, that it'd been too long and how he missed me and missed talking to me, he says he would drive to my work the next day, i tell him that i would be working at a different store and my shift is the same and he says don't worry he'll just wait for me to get off. He sends me a text message that says he's at the store now. I check the time of the message, its been 1 and a half hours since the original message with out a single update as to where he is, i ask why he never updated me, he replied saying that he didn't know how to message from his phone. My manager texts me asking if i can clock out early because my shift was over and he was there, so i text him and say that now that i was able to work with my schedules time change and leave early i would wait for him. After some of the longest 10-15 mins of my life he texts me saying that he lost my number (even though we text everyday for the past 6 months) and that he could see my work from the parking lot and he was going to try and find what store i was at. I ask him why he didn't ask the cashier since they know me and",

    "I'm not sure if this subreddit has any readers who are familiar with Stoic philosophy, but I've been reading about it for years now (and have even read some Seneca) without ever really getting into practice until recently when something happened that made me realize how much more important life was than what had previously seemed like its most pressing concerns... It's hard enough being an adult in today’s world; add on top all these other things we worry ourselves sick over every day just trying keep up appearances while still maintaining our sanity - well let alone finding time leftover actually enjoy anything! But then one night after work last week everything changed because suddenly there wasn't anymore room inside myself where fear could grow unchecked--instead only calm acceptance remained as though nothing else mattered except living each moment fully present within itself.\" The next morning at breakfast he said goodbye forevermore knowing deep down somewhere beneath surface level thoughts lies truth which cannot be denied no matter whom tries deny them first hand experience tells us so too often does happen unfortunately however sometimes people need reminding themselves before they can truly understand why certain actions should never again occur regardless whether done intentionally or unintentionally.”",
    "\"Hi, I recently came out to my mum and she was totally supportive. I'm very confused though. I'm pretty sure I'm Trans and want to transition. But I'm not sure if I'm just like going through the denial phase and after a year of \"thinking about it\" I will decide not to transition after all.\nAt the moment I feel a bit pressured to transition asap but I'm scared not to start righting my life as a girl soon enough and keep being in denial so for me not being able to transition is an option, it's an option of me not being happy for whatever reason. I could have a year of hating being a girl and regretting everything and in a year I would've transitioned, gone to therapist and done all of that. At the same time I know that I can't make the choice for me, I can't force this to be my feeling.\nSo you guys know better, how would you know if you're in the denial phase or it's what you really feel? For me I think I'm in denial bc when I think about me as girl I don't feel anything, I feel like a stranger to me and it kind of hurts. My mum asked me if I'm happy being me. And to be honest I never really thought about it because I could've been born as a girl and lived my life as a girl all my life because my personality wouldn't change. As a woman I don't like makeup but I don't dislike it and it doesn't bother me to wear it, I would if I was with someone I was getting intimate with which I'm not so I wouldn't know.\nSorry for the long post, I'm just confused and I'm scared. I tried my whole life to be a straight girl and I'm not, and I'm tired of pretending. I guess I just want to know how do I know if I'm just in denial or if it's what I really feel? Is not a thing about being a girl and feeling right with myself. If I was born as a girl I wouldn't mind.\"\nThank you for asking me to respond to this post. To be frank, I will not be responding to it, but I will respond to the question asked.\nThat person asked how they know if they are in denial or not. I'll give my take",

    "I'm 15 and I've been having problems with my mother for years now, but it's gotten worse recently because she has started making comments about how ugly/fat etc... that make her think no one will ever want anything more than friendship or sex (which isn't true). She also says things such as 'you're so stupid' when we argue over something small which hurts deeply since there are times where all you need someone who understands what they mean by their words instead just yelling at them without any explanation whatsoever! It doesn t help either way though; if your parents don ‘t love themselves then chances aren ’ even worth trying anymore.” The author goes on in this vein until finally concluding “My life sucks right?”. This story illustrates an important point - sometimes people can be too hard-hearted towards others due solely based off personal experience rather taking into account individual differences between individuals within society today. In addition many teens struggle through similar situations every day while growing up under parental guidance yet still manage find happiness despite these challenges along side other factors including peer pressure social media bullying among countless additional stressors faced daily throughout adolescence period itself!

    "If the \"Fuck\"s are all supposed to be funny, they don't work. The reason is that if you listen to the content of the scenes in which people just say \"Fuck\" repeatedly, it's terrible. It all feels very claustrophobic and unfunny and kind of dark.\n\nA. You could be saying you could go anywhere and you feel like you're stuck in this room with everyone just saying fuck over and over again. (Or)\n\nB. Maybe you have been feeling good about the fact McNulty has stopped doing drugs and is now working and focused and healthy, but the last part of the show where he's yelling \"Fuck\" and everyone else just yells it too is so miserable it basically tells you everything was fake, he is still horrible, and that he will soon start using again.\n\nThe main problem with this post is that the poster hasn't fully considered the function of alliteration in poetry, which is often used to achieve exactly the kind of effect the person is describing (or, more precisely, criticizing) here. As one commentator noted, \"It's the same trick with a couple other words at the end of the line that makes it so frustrating, but that's an essential part of alliteration and poetic devices like that.\"\n\nIn \"The Pike,\" Wallace is taking one of this poetic tradition's most celebrated moves, and using it to make the reader reflect on two things: the fact that language is made of phrases, and the things these phrases mean, and also the fact that in situations without words, these gestures and sounds may indeed be the only way that a person can communicate. The \"Fuck\"s work because they are an expression not just of frustration but of exhaustion.\n\nEven for readers who have never found themselves trapped in a room where everyone is saying \"Fuck\" over and over, this is, indeed, a frustrating situation, both for readers and for Wallace, who needs these \"Fuck\"s to convey an emotional charge, but also to convey McNulty's emotional exhaustion and to express the fact that he is no longer in control of his environment. That emotional exhaustion becomes not simply about McNulty, but the situation that Wallace is attempting to show",

I have a pickle tattoo that reads \"Pickles Forever\" on my neck. It also says \"I ❤️ pickle slices\" in small print at the top of my neck.\nUnfortunately, I went to seven different stores looking for pickles but couldn't get any in my area. In addition to that, I couldn't find pickle slices or any other type of pickle that would fit my needs at the time and would not taste good in my burger. As a result, I had to spend hours searching multiple grocery stores and gas stations for the perfect pickle slice. Finally, after all that hard work, I made it home.\nMy new friends came over for pickles. We had a great conversation about my trip and the pickles that I had found and their taste. At the end, I said goodbye. The last thing I told them was that if anyone wanted to try my new pickles, that they could buy them at the store where they bought them. Later that night, I ran into some of my older friends who I hadn't seen in a while.\nI asked them about pickles and they told me that they had tried them. Then they showed me their pickle tattoo that read \"Pickle Slices are the best and will never go out of style\". I told them how much I missed pickles and how sad it was when you had to get them at grocery stores. I asked them to share some pickle tips with me. They told me about how they had gone into all of those places I had checked for pickle slices and they told me about their favorite places to get pickles.\nAfter looking everything up, I discovered that pickle slice availability was a conspiracy.\nThis entry was posted in Conspiracy theories",

    "I've been trying to deal with my depression and anxiety on my own for so long, but it's getting worse. I don't know how much more of this I can take. I'm exhausted, both mentally and physically. I don't have the energy to keep pushing myself, but I also can't seem to bring myself to seek help. It's like I'm trapped in this never-ending cycle of suffering. I don't know what to do anymore.",
    "Hey guys, I know a lot of us are social and have plenty of friends, but sometimes it feels like we can't get that one special person to hang out with us or be our girlfriend. I'm definitely feeling that right now. It's tough to feel like you're not good enough or that there's something wrong with you, but I think it's important to remember that it's not about us, it's about finding the right person at the right time. I'm sure we'll all find someone who appreciates us for who we are soon enough.",
    "I recently had a disagreement with my dad about a family decision, and I stood firm on my beliefs. While I understand that he only wants what's best for us, I feel like my voice and opinions should be heard and respected as well. Am I in the wrong for asserting my own views, or does my dad need to learn to accept that we don't always see eye to eye?",
    "Hey everyone, I'm really struggling right now and I think I might be depressed. I've been feeling hopeless, sad, and unmotivated for a while now, and I don't know how to snap out of it. I've tried to talk to friends and family, but they don't really understand what I'm going through. I don't know if I should see a therapist or take medication, and I'm scared of what people will think if they find out I'm struggling with depression. I just don't know what to do.",
    "Body: It's natural to feel like you're the best at your craft, but holding onto that feeling too tightly can be detrimental to both yourself and your team. Remember that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and allowing others to shine in their own ways will only make your team stronger as a whole. Practice humility, communicate with your teammates effectively, and trust in each other's abilities. In turn, this will allow for better collaboration and growth opportunities for all involved. Let go of your ego and focus on building strong connections with those around you.",

    "Hey there, I know we all have our own struggles and whatnot, but sometimes it feels like no matter how hard we try to find solutions or comfort, we're still left with more questions than answers.

So yeah, today I just wanna scream out: WHERE ARE THE ANSWERS?!",
    "Hey everyone, I'm hoping someone can offer some insight or advice on something that's been concerning me lately. After recovering from COVID-19 earlier this year, I've noticed some strange symptoms related to my heart health. Specifically, I sometimes feel like there's a fluttery sensation in my chest and occasionally experience shortness of breath when doing simple activities like walking up stairs. Has anyone else experienced similar issues after having COVID-19? Any suggestions for what could be causing these symptoms or how to address them would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much in advance for any input.",
    "Body: Dealing with a small penis can be a difficult and frustrating experience, especially if you are in a new relationship or trying to establish a sexual connection with someone. It's important to remember that penis size does not define a person's sexual capabilities or pleasure, and that everyone has their own unique body and preferences. Communication is key in any relationship, so try talking to your partner about your concerns and see if they have any suggestions or solutions that can help you feel more comfortable and satisfied. Additionally, exploring different positions and techniques can also help enhance your sexual experience, regardless of penis size. Remember to be kind to yourself and focus on your own pleasure and satisfaction, rather than comparing yourself to others.",

    "Mercy's Damage Boost ability is incredibly powerful, as it increases her weapon's damage output by a significant amount for a short duration. However, there are some things that Mercy's Damage Boost cannot affect:\n\n 1) Healing Amplifier - While active, healing from all sources (including allies and enemy heroes) will be increased instead of dealing additional damage. \n 2) Ultimate Abilities - The boosted damage only applies to basic attacks and abilities like Tesla Cannon or Fusion Pistol; ultimate abilities such as Valkyrie or Dragonstrike remain unaffected. \n 3) Zarya's Graviton Surge - Although enemies take more damage while under the effect of Graviton Surge, they won't receive an added bonus from Damaged Boosted. \n 4) Armor Reduction - Enemies with reduced armor will still have their remaining armor value applied after calculating extra damages dealt by Mercys'DamageBoost. \n 5) Shields - Any shield present on opponents would absorb incoming damaged before applying any bonuses from mercys ult. \n 6) Heroic Strike/Critcal hits- Critals hit chance remains unchanged even if you use your Ult to increase dmg when heroics strike.",

    "I understand that it can be difficult to know how to support a friend who is going through a difficult time, especially if they have a mental health condition like borderline personality disorder. It’s important to remember that your friend is still the same person they always have been, and that their struggles with BPD do not define who they are. One way to show your support is to listen without judgment and offer a patient and understanding ear. Let them know that you are there for them and that you care about their wellbeing. It’s also important to seek out additional resources and support if you need it, such as reaching out to a mental health professional or joining a support group for friends and family members of those with BPD. Most importantly, let your friend know that they are not alone and that you are there to support them in any way that you can.",
    "Hey guys, I recently installed a new LED outdoor floodlight at my home but it's been giving me some trouble lately. Whenever I turn it on or off there is this annoying buzzing noise that occurs for about 5 seconds afterwards.

    "People often say that Ichigo has a lot of plot armor, but I disagree. If you look closely at his battles, you'll see that he's actually quite vulnerable. For example, in his fight against Ulquiorra, we see him getting beaten up pretty badly before finally managing to land a hit. And let's not forget about his battle with Grimmjow where he almost dies from an attack that should have killed any other normal human. Sure, he may be strong and able to do some incredible things, but it's clear that he's far from invincible.",

    "Hey everyone! I recently watched One Piece episodes 18-30 and wanted to share my thoughts on them. Overall, I found these episodes to be really engaging and full of exciting moments. \n\nOne thing that stood out to me was the development of the Straw Hat Pirates as a team. We see them starting to gel more as they work together and face various challenges. Luffy's determination and optimism also continue to shine through in these episodes, which makes him an even more likable character.\n\nAnother highlight for me was seeing some of the other characters' backstories revealed, such as Nami's past with her father and brother. This helped to give more depth to their personalities and motivations.\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of adventure anime or just looking for something fun to watch, I would definitely recommend checking out One Piece episodes 18-30!",

    "Yes, anxiety can cause symptoms even when you're not consciously anxious. This is because anxiety is an emotional response that occurs in the body, not just in the mind. The body can experience symptoms of anxiety even when the mind is not aware of feeling anxious. These symptoms can include increased heart rate, sweating, trembling, and feelings of unease or fear. It can be helpful to recognize that anxiety symptoms can arise even when you're not consciously feeling anxious, and to practice techniques like deep breathing or mindfulness to help manage these symptoms.",
