    "Shares in US phone company MCI have risen on speculation that it is in takeover talks.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Qwest has bid $6.3bn (£3.4bn) for MCI. Other firms have also expressed an interest in MCI, the second-largest US long-distance phone firm, and may now table rival bids, analysts said. Shares in MCI, which changed its name from Worldcom when it emerged from bankruptcy, were up 2.4% at $20.15. Press reports suggest that Qwest and MCI may reach an agreement as early as next week, although rival bids may muddy the waters. The largest US telephone company Verizon has previously held preliminary merger discussions with MCI, Reuters quoted sources as saying.\nConsolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. A merger between MCI and Qwest would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October. Last week, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. Competition has intensified and fixed-line phone providers such as MCI and AT&T have seen themselves overtaken by rivals. Buying MCI would give Qwest, a local phone service provider, access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers. MCI also offers internet services.\nMCI was renamed after it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April last year. It hit the headlines as Worldcom in 2002 after admitting it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. The scandal was a key factor in a global slide in share prices and the reverberations are still being felt today. Shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud.",
    "French musician Jean-Michel Jarre is to perform at a concert in Copenhagen to mark the bicentennial of the birth of writer Hans Christian Andersen.\nDenmark is holding a three-day celebration of the life of the fairy-tale author, with a concert at Parken stadium on 2 April. Other stars are expected to join the line-up in the coming months, and the Danish royal family will attend. \"Christian Andersen's fairy tales are timeless and universal,\" said Jarre. \"For all of us, at any age there is always - beyond the pure enjoyment of the tale - a message to learn.\" There are year-long celebrations planned across the world to celebrate Andersen and his work, which includes The Emperor's New Clothes and The Little Mermaid. Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary visited New York on Monday to help promote the festivities. The pair were at a Manhattan library to honour US literary critic Harold Bloom \"the international icon we thought we knew so well\".\n\"Bloom recognizes the darker aspects of Andersen's authorship,\" Prince Frederik said. Bloom is to be formally presented with the Hans Christian Andersen Award this spring in Anderson's hometown of Odense. The royal couple also visited the Hans Christian Anderson School complex, where Queen Mary read The Ugly Duckling to the young audience. Later at a gala dinner, Danish supermodel Helena Christensen was named a Hans Christian Andersen ambassador. Other ambassadors include actors Harvey Keitel and Sir Roger Moore, athlete Cathy Freeman and Brazilian soccer legend Pele.",
    "Actress Nicole Kidman has won a restraining order against two paparazzi photographers who she claims left her fearful of leaving her Sydney mansion.\nThe Oscar-winning star took action against Jamie Fawcett and Ben McDonald after a bugging device was found outside her home earlier this week. Lawyers for the pair denied allegations they had planted the device. The Australian actress is currently in Sydney to film her latest movie, Eucalyptus, with Russell Crowe. Kidman was prompted to take action following a reported high-speed car chase with members of the paparazzi in Sydney last weekend.\nAccording to local newspaper the Daily Telegraph, the incident involved paparazzi driving through red lights and on the wrong side of the road in pursuit of Kidman's vehicle. Lawyers for Mr Fawcett and Mr McDonald denied that the pair were involved in the chase. Kidman sought the \"apprehended violence\" orders - normally used in Australia in cases of domestic violence and similar incidents - after being advised to do so by local police. \"Nicole would like to make it clear that she acknowledges she is a public figure and that reporters and photographers have a job to do and she respects that,\" said Kidman's publicist Wendy Day. \"However, these are specific actions against two individuals who, over a period of time, have caused her to feel threatened, intimidated and unable to leave her home without fearing for her safety.\" Magistrate Lee Gilmore, who issued the restraining order at Waverley Local Court in Sydney, said she understood the photographers were entitled to earn a living but there had to be limits to their behaviour. \"Miss Kidman says she's willing to put up with some of it, but it's gone beyond that,\" she said. \"I do believe the allegation in relation to the driving is a serious issue.\"",
    "Arsenal's Sol Campbell has called the rivalry between Manchester United and the Gunners \"bitter and personal\".\nPast encounters have stirred up plenty of ill-feeling between the sides and they meet again at Highbury on Tuesday. \"It is just more bitter and personal against United,\" the defender told The Guardian newspaper. \"There's an edge. \"After all that has happened, if we beat them it will be one of our sweetest ever wins, especially because of how we lost to them up there.\" Last October, Arsenal lost 2-0 at Old Trafford, which ended a record 49-match unbeaten league run and sparked a mini-crisis, with the Gunners winning only three of their next 10 games.\n\"It had a psychological impact on us, but again because of the way we were defeated,\" added the 30-year-old, referring to a controversial penalty award for United's first goal. \"That was far more upsetting, losing like that, because they just seem to get away with it. You try and balance out over the course of a season but I've had so many rough decisions against them you begin to wonder.\" With tensions spilling over afterwards - United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was allegedly pelted with pizza in the players' tunnel - there is little surprise that so much is riding on the return encounter on. \"Everyone at Arsenal has been waiting for this game,\" said Campbell. \"We are up for this one.\"\nSpeaking on his long-term plans, Campbell signalled his intent to move abroad before he turns 35. \"I'm 30 now and in five years' time I won't be in this country - that's definite. \"Italy looks good to me because it would suit my kind of football. Spain is an option but the idea of tasting a new culture and learning another language excites me the most. I'm starting a little with French, of course.\"",
    "Shell has signed a $6bn (£3.12bn) deal with the Middle Eastern sheikhdom of Qatar to supply liquid natural gas (LNG) to North America and Europe.\nThe UK-Dutch group will own 30% of the project, with Qatar's state oil firm owning the rest. The agreement is the latest in a string of deals reached by Qatar, which is trying to make itself a regional leader in natural gas. US oil giant ExxonMobil signed up for a $12.8bn deal earlier on Sunday. France's Total is expected to join the ExxonMobil scheme, dubbed Qatargas-2, on Monday, taking 5 million tonnes of LNG a year. ExxonMobil will be taking some 15 million tonnes each year for 25 years from the end of 2007 under the deal. Shell's agreement, under the name Qatargas-4, foresees the building of new facilities to handle 1.4 billion cubic feet of gas, and 7.8 million tonnes of LNG each year from 2011 onwards.",
    "Text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in Asia.\nThe messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation. Now some are studying how the technology behind SMS could be better used during an emergency. Sanjaya Senanayake works for Sri Lankan television. The blogging world, though, might know him better by his online name, Morquendi. He was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the Sri Lankan coast. Cell phone signals were weak. Land lines were unreliable. So Mr Senanayake started sending out text messages. The messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of \"who needs what and where\". Blogging friends in India took Mr Senanayake's text messages and posted them on a weblog called Dogs without Borders. Thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent.\nAnd that's when Mr Senanayake started to wonder if SMS might be put to more practical use. \"SMS networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call,\" he says.\n\"In every rural community, there's at least one person who has access to a mobile phone, or has a mobile phone, and can receive messages.\" Half a world away, in the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, Taran Rampersad read Morquendi's messages. Mr Rampersad, who used to work in the military, knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster. He wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages, and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. Mr Rampersad said: \"Imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets, and had a central place to send a text message to that effect. \"He can message the server, so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field.\" He added: \"Or, send it at the same time to other people who are using SMS in the region, and they might have an excess of it, and be able to shift supplies to the right places.\"\nMr Rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since Hurricane Ivan ravaged the Caribbean and the southern United States last September. Last week, he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for Asia.\nIn only 72 hours, he found Dan Lane, a text message guru living in Britain. The pair, along with a group of dedicated techies, are creating what they call the Alert Retrieval Cache. The idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help. \"This is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people,\" says Paul Saffo, a director at the California-based Institute for the Future. \"You may be halfway around the world from someone, but in cyberspace you're just one click or one e-mail away,\" he said, \"That's put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery, where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they're not right on top of the tragedy.\" It is still very early days for the project, though. In an e-mail, Dan Lane calls it \"an early proof of concept.\" Right now, the Alert Retrieval Cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page, or distribute it to an e-mail list. In the near future, the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas, and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages. But there's still another challenge. You have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use. \"It's amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to, and say, look this is what we're trying to do and everything like that,\" says Mr Rampersad. \"So the big problem right now is the same problem we're trying to solve - human communication.\" He is optimistic, however. He thinks that the Alert Retrieval Cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments, too, will sit up and take notice. And he stands by his motto, courtesy of Michelangelo: criticise by creating.\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.",
    "Arsenal's Brazilian midfielder Edu has hit out at the club for stalling over offering him a new contract.\nEdu's deal expires next summer and he has been linked with Spanish trio Real Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. He told BBC Sport: \"I'm not sure if I want to stay or not because the club have let the situation go on this far. \"If they had really wanted to sign they should have come up with an offer six months before indicating they wanted to sign me and that's made me think.\" Edu's brother and representative Amadeo Fensao has previously said that Arsenal's current offer to the midfielder was well short of what he was seeking. And Edu, 26, added: \"My brother is due to come to London on Thursday.\n\"There is a meeting planned for 6 or 7 January to sort it out with Arsenal. \"Now I have a choice to stay or go. I want to sort it out as soon as possible, that's in the best interests of both the club and myself. \"I'm going to make my decision after the meeting later this week.\" Edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because Fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire. The midfielder, who broke in to the Brazilian national side in 2004, admitted he had been flattered to have been linked with the three Spanish giants. Edu said: \"I've just heard stories from the news that the Madrid president Florentino Perez, the Valencia people, as well as Barcelona are interested.\n\"That's nice, but I've never talked to them, so I can't say they want me sign 100%.\" Last month Wenger said he we was hopeful Edu would sign a new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of a club like Real Madrid would be too strong for Edu. Edu added that he had been encouraged by Wenger's support for him. \"I still have a good relationship with Arsene Wenger - he's always said he wants me to sign.\"",
    "Ken Bates has completed his takeover of Leeds United.\nThe 73-year-old former Chelsea chairman sealed the deal at 0227 GMT on Friday, and has bought a 50% stake in the club. He said: \"I'm delighted to be stepping up to the mantel at such a fantastic club. I recognise Leeds as a great club that has fallen on hard times. \"We have a lot of hard work ahead to get the club back where it belongs in the Premiership, and with the help of our fans we will do everything we can.\" Bates bought his stake under the guise of a Geneva-based company known as The Forward Sports Fund. He revealed that part of his plan is to buy back Leeds' Elland Road stadium and Thorp Arch training ground in due course.\n\"It's going to be a tough jon and the first task is to stabilise the cash flow and sort out the remaining creditors,\" Bates added. \"But there is light at the end of a very long tunnel. For the past year it has been a matter of firefighting - now we can start running the club again.\" Outgoing Leeds chairman Gerald Krasner said: \"This deal ensures the medium to long term survival of the club and I believe Mr Bates' proposals are totally for the benefit of the club. \"We are content that under Mr Bates, Leeds United will continue to consolidate and move forward. \"When we took over Leeds United in March 2004, the club had a debt of £103m, since that date, my board has succeeded in reducing the debt to under £25m. \"We worked tirelessly to solve all of the problems at Leeds United. \"Eighty percent of the problems have already been overcome and we came to this agreement with Mr Bates to secure its ongoing success.\" Krasner revealed that his consortium has been asked to remain in the background at the club for an undisclosed period to help ensure a smooth hand-over. He will stay on in an unpaid capacity while Peter Lorimer will continue in his role as director and point of contact for the fans and Peter McCormick will serve as a consultant to the incoming board. The other outgoing directors have agreed to leave their loans of £4.5m in the company for the next four years. On Leeds' new-look board it is understood that Lorimer will be joined by former Chelsea finance director Yvonne Todd and Bates' lawyer Mark Taylor.\nKrasner refused to give any details of the finances involved in the takeover. He told BBC Five Live: \"I am not going into the figures. If Ken wants to give them up that is up to him. I can not tell you what the money will be used for. \"This dea l is not about money for the current board. In the last four months I never saw any cheques until this week from one person. I am not stretching figures, we don't discuss internal arrangements.\" Bates stepped down as Chelsea chairman in March last year following Roman Abramovich's £140m takeover at Stamford Bridge. In May, he made a proposal to invest £10m in Sheffield Wednesday, but this was rejected by the club. Sebastien Sainsbury had been close to a takeover of Leeds but withdrew his £25m offer last week.\nHis efforts failed after he revealed it would take £40m to stage a takeover, and that the club will also lose £10m over the next six months. The club was on the brink of administration - and the deduction of 10 points by the Football League - before Bates' arrival but his investment has spared them that prospect.",
    "Gordon D'Arcy has been ruled out of the Ireland team for Saturday's Six Nations clash against Scotland in Murrayfield.\nLike skipper Brian O'Driscoll, D'Arcy failed to recover from a hamstring injury. The side will now be led by Munster lock Paul O'Connell. Shane Horgan switches from wing to centre where he will be joined by Ulster's Kevin Maggs. Girvan Dempsey comes into the team to take the right wing spot while Gavin Duffy is called up to the replacements.

    "The body that oversees how the net works, grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last 10 years, but it is just the start.\n\"In a sense, we have hardly started in reaching the whole population,\" the new chair of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Brian Carpenter, says. The IETF ensures the smooth running and organisation of the net's architecture. With broadband take-up growing, services like voice and TV will open up interesting challenges for the net. \"I think VoIP (Voice-over Internet Protocol, allowing phone calls to be made over the Net) is very important - it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms,\" says Dr Carpenter. \"Second, it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be a service provider with a lot of infrastructure. With VoIP, you need very little infrastructure.\"\nA distinguished IBM engineer, Dr Carpenter spent 20 years at Cern, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics. As the new chair of the IETF, his next big challenge is overseeing IPv6, the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web. At Cern, Dr Carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web, so he is well-placed to take on such a task. The net's growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols, and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the IETF. The top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work, are open and free for anyone to use and work with.\nThe net is built on a protocol called TCP/IP, which means transmission control protocol, and internet protocol. When computers communicate with the net, a unique IP address is used to send and receive information. The IETF is a large international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers working on the evolution of the net's architecture and the way this information is sent and received. They make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps. \"We've seen some interesting effects over last few years,\" explains Dr Carpenter. \"The net was growing at a fantastic rate at the end of the 90s. Then there was a bit of a glitch in 2000. \"We are now seeing a very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth.\"\nThat renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies, like China, which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies. The number of broadband subscribers via DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) doubled in a year to 13 million, according to figures released at the end of 2004. \"The challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate,\" explained Dr Carpenter. \"Given it [the net] was designed for the whole community, it has done well to reach millions. If you want to reach the whole population, you have to make sure it can scale up.\" IPv6, the standard that will replace the existing IPv4, will allow for billions more addresses on the net, and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world. \"The actual number of addresses with IPv4 is limited to four billion IP addresses. \"That clearly is not enough when you have 10 billion people to serve, so there is technical solution, the new version of IP - IPv6. \"It has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits,\" said Dr Carpenter. Standards are vital to something as complex as the net, and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task. The difference this next generation standard, IPv6, will make to the average net user is almost invisible. \"Our first goal is that it [IPv6] should make no difference - people should not notice a difference. \"It is like when the London telephone numbers got longer. A lot of the process will be invisible. \"People are usually given an IP address without knowing it.\" Technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled, said Dr Carpenter.\nThe one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security. To Dr Carpenter, the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour. People have to be educated about \"sensible behaviour\" he says, such as ignoring e-mails that claim you have won something.\n\"I don't think it is going to get worse. People will remain concerned about security and they probably should do - just as you would be concerned walking along a dark street. \"We have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards. It is a never-ending battle in a sense.\" But, he adds: \"Even if security has improved, you still worry a bit. Unfortunately, it is just part of life. We have a duty to do what we can.\"",
    "Music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.\nThe debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser's dream come true and a branding nightmare. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing 'oxygen' for companies that support illegal downloading. \"You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,\" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.\nHe urged people to follow his lead and 'dump' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. 'Networks like eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses,\" it said. But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\nThe reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. \"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,\" he said. \"If you put the legality issues aside, not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience,\" he added. Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical. \"We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. It is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks,\" read a statement from the discount phone firm. It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.\nHowever Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said. \"I would be surprised if these brands didn't have the know-how to prevent this happening,\" he said. At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. \"Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity, including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - Senator John Kerry and President George W. Bush,\" said chief executive Sam Yagan. There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network, he thinks. \"Peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they're most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media,\" he said.",
    "So-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004, say security experts.\nThe number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm MessageLabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. In 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. Other statistics show that in 2004 73% of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus.\nIn its end-of-year report, MessageLabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. In September 2003, MessageLabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. But by September 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month. Worryingly, said the firm, phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data.\nOlder attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened. Other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards. \"E-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity,\" said Mark Sunner, chief technology officer at MessageLabs. \"In just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online,\" he said. Mr Sunner said MessageLabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation. \"Already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed, indicating a shift from the random, scattergun approach, to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses,\" he said. Although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004, viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. One of the biggest outbreaks took place in January when the MyDoom virus started circulating. To date the company has caught more than 60 million copies of the virus. Also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation. In 2003 only 40% of messages were spam. But by the end of 2004, almost three-quarters of messages were junk.",
    "Oracle has announced it is cutting about 5,000 jobs following the completion of its $10.3bn takeover of its smaller rival Peoplesoft last week.\nThe company said it would retain more than 90% of Peoplesoft product development and product support staff. The cuts will affect about 9% of the 55,000 staff of the combined companies. Oracle's 18-month fight to acquire Peoplesoft was one of the most drawn-out and hard-fought US takeover battles of recent times. The merged companies are set to be a major force in the enterprise software market, second only in size to Germany's SAP.\nIn a statement, Oracle said it began notifying staff of redundancies on Friday and the process would continue over the next 10 days. \"By retaining the vast majority of Peoplesoft technical staff, Oracle will have the resources to deliver on the development and support commitments we have made to Peoplesoft customers over the last 18 months,\" Oracle's chief executive Larry Ellison said in a statement.\nCorrespondents say 6,000 job losses had been expected - and some suggest more cuts may be announced in future. They say Mr Ellison may be trying to placate Peoplesoft customers riled by Oracle's determined takeover strategy. Hours before Friday's announcement, there was a funereal air at Peoplesoft's headquarters, reported AP news agency. A Peoplesoft sign had been turned into shrine to the company, with flowers, candles and company memorabilia. \"We're mourning the passing of a great company,\" the agency quoted Peoplesoft worker David Ogden as saying. Other employees said they would rather be sacked than work for Oracle. \"The new company is going to be totally different,\" said Anil Aggarwal, Peoplesoft's director of database markets. \"Peoplesoft had an easygoing, relaxed atmosphere.

    "China lent Russia $6bn (£3.2bn) to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos, it has been revealed.\nThe Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks. The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China. The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China's CNPC.\nAccording to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yugansk's former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. \"The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,\" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan. \"There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.\"\nThe announcements help to explain how Rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk. Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.\nThe embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. But Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once the country's richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.\nThe deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. China's thirst for products such as crude oil, copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels. \"Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage [in Russia],\" said Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton. \"They understand property rights in Russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.\" \"If the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the Chinese,\" Mr Lukashov continued. \"And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash, so it's a good deal for them too.\"",

Pasquale had been the show's hottest ever favourite to win, and its hosts Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, known as Ant and Dec, said Monday's deciding vote was the closest in the programme's history.\nPascuale has been flooded with offers of TV work, according to his management company, but one of his first jobs on his return is pantomime.\nBefore joining I'm a Celebrity, he had signed up to play Jack in Jack and the Beanstalk in Birmingham, and tickets for the show have become increasingly popular since he joined the TV show. His manager Robert Voice said: \"We've had interest from different TV producers. Some are for comedy shows, some are new-type projects. \"There are a number of things Joe wants to do. He is very ambitious. \"He wants to play the West End and do different things other than straightforward comedy. We are talking to a couple of West End producers about a musical.\"",
    "The family of an Iraqi civilian allegedly killed by UK troops have won a challenge against the government's refusal to order a full inquiry.\nThe High Court ruled on Tuesday that Baha Mousa's death in British custody in Iraq fell within the European Convention on Human Rights. And the judges paved the way for an independent inquiry by saying previous investigations were inadequate. But judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern Iraq were ruled out. Their families will be appealing against the judgement.\nThe families' solicitor Phil Shiner described it as \"a historic day for human rights and the rule of law in the UK\". Father-of-two Mr Mousa, 28, a hotel receptionist, was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in Basra in September 2003. He was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment. The Iraqi families' lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the European Convention on Human Rights.\nMinistry of Defence lawyers argued the UK-controlled area of southern Iraq was outside European jurisdiction. But Lord Justice Rix and Mr Justice Forbes ruled that UK jurisdiction could extend to a UK-run prison, but did not apply \"to the total territory of another state\". They said as Mr Mousa was in custody when he died, his case came within the UK's jurisdiction. The other five Iraqis did not die in custody, so their cases had to fail, they said.\nAnd it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred \"has been timely, open or effective\", the judges said. After the ruling Carla Ferstman, legal director of the human rights organisation Redress, said: \"It is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors. \"There must be an effective public investigation by an independent official body. Only such an investigation could reveal what really happened and who might be responsible.\" Other allegations involving British soldiers included the shooting of an Iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four Iraqi civilians in May 2003. Both sides were granted permission to appeal.\nPrime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said: \"Obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment. I would point out, however, that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority. \"I can't say anything further for obvious reasons. The MoD are considering whether to appeal.\" But former British Commander Colonel Bob Stewart said : \"Anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say: 'If there's a case to answer, let's have it out. Because we don't want people thinking that British soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it',\" he said. \"The Ministry of Defence does everything in its power to try to prove we act ethically and properly under the rules of war.\"",
    "Snow Patrol had \"no other course of action\" but to ask their co-founder and bassist to leave the band, lead singer Gary Lightbody has said.\nMark McClelland had been in the band for more than 10 years since its formation at Dundee University. Lightbody said \"over the last 18 months touring has taken its toll on the rest of the band's relationship with him\". He said: \"This is the hardest decision we have ever had to make and believe us when we say we didn't make it lightly.\" The group, originally from Northern Ireland, has only achieved mainstream success in the last year with the single Run and award-winning album Final Straw. In a statement on the band's website, Lightbody said: \"I started the group with Mark 10 years ago and he was a massive part of Snow Patrol and my life throughout that decade.\"\nHe added: \"It got to the stage that things couldn't go on as they were, so we felt there was no other course of action but this. \"I know you will all be distressed and may not understand this news but we had to do what was best for the band.\" Snow Patrol are currently working on the follow-up to their breakthrough third album. The band is set to play support to U2 on a number of summer stadium gigs. Last month, they were the big winners in Ireland's top music honours, the Meteor Awards, picking up accolades for best band and album. It followed nominations for the Brit Awards and the Mercury Music Prize. The band formed in 1994 when Lightbody and McClelland met as students at Dundee University.",
    "A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.\nThe drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits. But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.\nApproximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK. Many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.\nNow, GW Pharma's Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. \"We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,\" said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.\nThe UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex's launch in the UK. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p.",
    "An ex-chief financial officer at Boeing has received a four-month jail sentence and a fine of $250,000 (£131,961) for illegally hiring a top Air Force aide.\nMichael Sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting Darleen Druyun while she still handled military contracts. Ms Druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring Boeing when awarding lucrative contracts. Boeing lost a $23bn government contract after a Pentagon inquiry into the case. The contract, to provide refuelling tankers for the US Air Force, was cancelled last year.\nThe Pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth $3bn which it believes may have been tainted by Ms Druyun's role in the procurement process. Boeing sacked Mr Sears and Ms Druyun in November 2003 after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy. Ms Druyun had talks with Mr Sears in October 2002 about working for Boeing, while she was still a top procurement official within the Pentagon. She subsequently joined the company in January 2003. Ms Druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to Boeing and other favoured companies.\nIn documents filed in a Virginia court ahead of Mr Sears' sentencing, prosecutors blamed Boeing's senior management for failing to ask key questions about the \"legal and ethical issues\" surrounding Ms Druyun's appointment. Mr Sears told prosecutors that no other Boeing officials were aware that Ms Druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with Boeing. However, analysts believe Boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal. The Pentagon has investigated 400 contracts, dating back to 1993, since the allegations against Ms Druyun came to light.\nBoeing's corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years. Boeing was sued by Lockheed Martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition. Boeing apologised publicly for the affair - although it claimed it did not gain any unfair advantage - and pledged to improve its procedures. The Pentagon subsequently revoked $1bn worth of contracts assigned to Boeing and prohibited the Seattle-based company from future rocket work.",
    "Tory leader Michael Howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas.\nMr Howard, whose parents fled the Nazi threat to come to the UK, says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. His comments come in a BBC documentary called 'No More Mr Nasty'. TV presenter Anne Robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would \"like to kick your cat\". Ms Robinson, a friend of the Tory leader, also revealed that as a Cambridge student Mr Howard was \"much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover\" - although she denied having personal experience. \"I wasn't at Cambridge - and it's not personal experience - but I know people who were.\"\nDocumentary maker Michael Cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to Mr Howard for his film portrait. The Tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s, his parents might not have been allowed into the country.\nHe replies: \"What is the inference of that? \"That if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you're not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants? \"That seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition? It would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister.\"\nMs Robinson, who presents The Weakest Link tells Cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in John Major's government. \"I used to have to sit on my hands because he'd get on television and give a passable impression of someone who'd like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. I mean it was very, very Draconian.\" The film shows Mr Howard laughing at Rory Bremner's impression of him as Dracula, which he calls \"good fun\", apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the UK. The film shows the private side of the Tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife, ex-model Sandra. Asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses: \"Yeah, it would be more enjoyable if I could win occasionally too, but otherwise it's quite fun.\"\nFormer Downing Street communications chief Alastair Campbell, now working on Labour's election campaign, says a \"touchy-feely\" image does not fit Mr Howard. He says Tony Blair was not worried by his opponents' early performance in their Commons clashes because Mr Howard lacked a \"big strategy\", including on issues like Iraq. The Tory leader brands such criticisms as \"absolutely rubbish\", arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of Mr Blair's failure to tell the truth on intelligence. Former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke says Mr Howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the Tory party than his personal image. Mr Clarke says the party is improving and it is \"conceivable\" it could win the next election. But he adds: \"It has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal.\"\n- Michael Howard: No More Mr Nasty is being shown on BBC2 on Saturday 12 February at 2005 GMT.",
    "Tony Blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on Monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 May.\nThe date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and, despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll, it has not shifted. Over the weeks, there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day Mr Blair would go for an historic third term. And the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent. The prime minister and his campaign boss Alan Milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between Labour's stability and investment against Tory cuts and boom and bust.\nAnd Chancellor Gordon Brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in Westminster - to underline that economic message. And it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties' tax and spend policies.\nDuring the phoney campaign, Labour got into trouble over its central claim that Michael Howard was planning £35 bn cuts in public services. The prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller, slower increase in spending planned by the Tories compared to Labour's plans was a cut. And it looked like the Labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by Mr Howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks. Then deputy Conservative Chairman Howard Flight was reported to have suggested Mr Howard was secretly planning even bigger \"cuts\".\nHe was sacked for his gaffe, but the damage had been done and the faltering Labour campaign was back on track. A second central argument will be over taxation, with the Tories claiming the Chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if Labour wins again. Mr Brown slaps that aside, claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate. As usual, the Liberal Democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties. But leader Charles Kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. Other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum, the war on Iraq, law and order and education, for example. But, as ever, it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. And, whatever that outcome, 2005 is set to be a far more lively, even bitter campaign than 2001's non-event.",
    "Michael Howard has backed stem cell research, saying it is important people are not frightened of the future.\nThe controversial issue was a feature of the recent US presidential election, where George Bush opposed extending it. But the Tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Motor Neurone disease. \"I believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses,\" he said. The use of embryonic stem cells in the UK is already allowed. Stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body's tissue types. Scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney, heart or even brain tissue.\nMr Howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research. But he argued: \"We mustn't be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future. \"Politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind. \"With the life expectancy of the average Briton now around the mid-70s, society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people's lives as they grow older. \"I know many people are concerned about stem-cell research. They are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls. \"I respect those concerns. But I also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Alzheimer's and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems.\"\nMr Howard acknowledged there were \"no easy answers\" over such an issue but it was necessary to \"have the courage to do what we know to be morally right\". He added: \"Of course, stem cells are still a recent discovery. More research needs to be done. But we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown-up way. The hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved.\" Former Superman actor the late Christopher Reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident. Mr Howard made his remarks during a speech in Westminster to the Conservative National Women's Committee on ambitions and values.",
    "Simon Taylor has been named in the Scotland squad for Saturday's Six Nations clash with Italy.\nThe 25-year-old number eight made a scoring return for Edinburgh at the weekend - his first game in a year for the capital side. Taylor suffered knee ligament damage playing against Ireland in Dublin in the 2004 Six Nations championship. \"Simon is one of Scotland's truly world class players so it is a huge bonus,\" said team-mate Chris Paterson. \"He brings a whole new dimension to us, especially in defence and his ability to slow the opposition ball down could be key against Italy if he is involved.\" Taylor has turned out for English side Saracens in recent weeks during a short-term loan to improve his fitness.\nEdinburgh were not in action during the first two weeks of this season's Six Nations. So Taylor played the last 20 minutes of Saracens' win over Northampton and then 40 minutes in a friendly against South African Super 12 side The Cats. Scotland coach Matt Williams is due to name his match-day 22 on Thursday. Both Scotland and Italy have lost their opening two Six Nations games and, just like last season's encounter which Italy won, this weekend's game could turn out to be a battle to avoid the wooden spoon.\n- M Blair (Edinburgh), A Craig (Glasgow), C Cusiter (Borders), S Danielli (Borders), M Di Rollo (Edinburgh), A Henderson (Glasgow), B Hinshelwood (Worcester), R Lamont (Glasgow), S Lamont (Glasgow), D Parks (Glasgow), C Paterson (Edinburgh), G Ross (Leeds), H Southwell (Edinburgh), S Webster (Edinburgh)\n- R Beattie (Northampton), G Bulloch (Glasgow, capt), B Douglas (Borders), J Dunbar (Leeds), I Fullarton (Saracens), S Grimes (Newcastle), N Hines (Edinburgh), A Hogg (Edinburgh), G Kerr (Leeds), N Lloyd (Saracens), S Murray (Edinburgh), J Petrie (Glasgow), R Russell (London Irish), C Smith (Edinburgh), T Smith (Northampton), S Taylor (Edinburgh), J White (Sale).",
    "Tony Blair's big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign.\nThat poll may still be about 16 weeks away, but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing. The prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto. There was a detailed account of the government's past record, with a major emphasis on the economy and public services. There was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with Chancellor Gordon Brown. And there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly \"New\" Labour - although that may continue to irritate his chancellor.\nThere was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges, although the prime minister talked about a \"New Labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society\". His was more a speech designed to remind people, and some in his own party, precisely what New Labour stood for, and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach. And, for some, that means showing that New Labour actually does stand for something - that it is, as he said, more than \"an electoral device\".\nTo that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle England voters who switched to the party in 1997 and stuck with it, possibly through some gritted teeth, in 2001, and to more traditional lower income old Labour supporters. In a key section, he declared: \"In our third term we can achieve an unprecedented widening of opportunity and prosperity. \"For the first time ever a whole generation growing up with unbroken economic stability. Every family - not just the fortunate few - knowing their children will have an inheritance at adulthood. \"Every pupil in every secondary school guaranteed a place in university or a quality apprenticeship. Every adult - including those who missed out at school - able to get the skills then need to advance. \"Home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it. \"The highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions\".\nUnder what is to be the general election slogan \"Britain is working\", the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly New Labour. That might get under the skin of Mr Brown, but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful post-war chancellor Britain has had. Probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men, in so far as there is one, is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services.\nAn unremittingly \"New\" Labour manifesto, as the prime minister is happy to make plain, will stress the importance of that - the belief patients and parents, for example, want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them. The chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance, although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle. With an election looming the next big speech from Gordon Brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and, in particular, the use of that little three letter word. But for now, all eyes have been focused on the next general election. And for many in Westminster, Mr Blair's performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on 5 May.",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "Japanese electronics firm Hitachi has unveiled its first humanoid robot, called Emiew, to challenge Honda's Asimo and Sony's Qrio robots.\nHitachi said the 1.3m (4.2ft) Emiew was the world's quickest-moving robot yet. Two wheel-based Emiews, Pal and Chum, introduced themselves to reporters at a press conference in Japan. The robots will be guests at the World Expo later this month. Sony and Honda have both built sophisticated robots to show off developments in electronics. Explaining why Hitachi's Emiew used wheels instead of feet, Toshihiko Horiuchi, from Hitachi's Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, said: \"We aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people.\" \"We want to make the robots useful for people ... If the robots moved slower than people, users would be frustrated.\" Emiew - Excellent Mobility and Interactive Existence as Workmate - can move at 3.7m/h. Its \"wheel feet\" resemble the bottom half of a Segway scooter. With sensors on the head, waist, and near the wheels, Pal and Chum demonstrated how they could react to commands. \"I want to be able to walk about in places like Shinjuku and Shibuya [shopping districts] in the future without bumping into people and cars,\" Pal told reporters. Hitachi said Pal and Chum, which have a vocabulary of about 100 words, could be \"trained\" for practical office and factory use in as little as five to six years.\nRobotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human. At the recent AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) annual meeting in Washington DC, researchers showed off bipedal designs. The three designs, each built by a different research group, use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait.\nSony and Honda have both used humanoid robots, which are not commercially available, as a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise. Honda's Asimo was \"born\" five years ago. Since then, Honda and Sony's Qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events. Asimo, has visited the UK, Germany, the Czech Republic, France and Ireland as part of a world tour. Sony's Qrio has been singing, jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was, until last year, the fastest robot on two legs. But its record was beaten by Asimo. It is capable of 3km/h, which its makers claim is almost four times as fast as Qrio. Last year, car maker Toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot. By 2007, it is predicted that there will be almost 2.5 million \"entertainment and leisure\" robots in homes, compared to about 137,000 currently, according to the United Nations (UN). By the end of that year, 4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes, said the report by the UN Economic Commission for Europe and the International Federation of Robotics. Hitachi is one of the companies with home cleaning robot machines on the market.",

Forty-two films will debut at Sundance, including The Liberace of Baghdad by British director Sean McAllister. The prestigious festival was founded by actor Robert Redford in 1981.\n\"We have always had an international component, but from next year they will enter a jury competition,\" festival director Geoffrey Gilmore said. \"We wanted to give world cinema more emphasis and have now put it on par with the American dramatic and documentary competitions.\" Twelve films competing in the new world cinema documentary category focus on countries and people under siege.\nThe Liberace of Baghdad features an Iraqi pianist hiding in a hotel as he waits for a visa, while Finnish film The Three Rooms of Melancholia looks at the war in Chechnya. Shake Hands With The Devil: The Journey of Romeo Dallaire tells of a UN mission to Rwanda during the 1994 genocide, while French-Israeli production Wall looks at Israel's controversial security wall separating it from the Palestinian territories. The 16 films competing in the new world cinema dramatic category include works from Germany, South Korea, Angola, China, Denmark and Australia.\nSeveral Hollywood stars feature in the festival's American independent drama category, including Keanu Reeves and Benjamin Bratt. Vince Vaughn stars in quirky movie Thumbsucker while 21 Grams actress Naomi Watts plays a budding Hollywood actress in Ellie Parker.

    "The US dollar has hit a new record low against the euro and analysts predict that more declines are likely in 2005.\nDisappointing economic reports dented the currency, which had been rallying after European policy makers said they were worried about the euro's strength. Earlier on Thursday, the Japanese yen touched its lowest versus the euro on concerns about economic growth in Asia. Currency markets have been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. This has amplified reactions, analysts said, adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in January.\n\"People want to go into the weekend and the New Year positioned for a weaker buck,\" said Tim Mazanec, director of foreign exchange at Investors Bank and Trust. The dollar slid to a record $1.3666 versus the euro on Thursday, before bouncing back to $1.3636. Against the yen the dollar was trading down at $103.05.\nThe yen, meanwhile, dropped to 141.60 per euro in afternoon trading. It later strengthened to 140.55. Investors are concerned about the size of the US trade and budget deficits and are betting that George W Bush's administration will allow the dollar to weaken despite saying they favour a strong currency. Also playing on investors' minds are mixed reports about the state of the US economy. On Thursday, disappointing business figures from Chicago brought a sudden end to a rally in the value of the dollar. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its index dropped to 61.2, more than analysts had expected. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. Mr Berlusconi said the euro's strength was \"absolutely worrying\" for Italian exports.

May said: \"Suddenly the Queen Phoenix is rising again from the ashes and will take precedence over... our lives.\" Queen have played with many different singers since Mercury's death in 1991 but have reportedly not toured. May performed with Rodgers at a concert to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster guitar in London in September.\n\"We were both so amazed at the chemistry that was going on in [Free hit] All Right Now, that suddenly it seems blindingly obvious that there was 'something happening here,'\" May wrote on his website. They teamed up again for a concert to mark their induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and were joined by Taylor. \"The show went so incredibly well from our point of view, and we got so many rave reactions from out there, we decided almost then and there that we would look at a tour together,\" May wrote.\nQueen went to number one in 2000 with a version of We Will Rock You sung by boy band 5ive and they have also played with Robbie Williams, Will Young and Bob Geldof. Queen bassist John Deacon has currently retired from the stage. Rodgers was singer with early 1970s rockers Free, who had a global hit with All Right Now, before forming Bad Company, a successful \"supergroup\" with members of King Crimson and Mott the Hoople.

    "The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.\nAccording to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs in January. The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year's election. However, when adding December and January's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory.\nThe Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.\nAnalysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. \"It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,\" said Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group. \"We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment.\" \"The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,\" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. \"That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.\"",
    "Elvis fans around the world have been marking the legendary singer's 70th birthday on Saturday.\nA three-day Elvis convention took place in Blackpool, England, over the weekend with the aim of finding the best European Elvis impersonator. His Graceland, Tennessee, home was the focus for US celebrations with four days of events including a concert by the Memphis Symphony Orchestra. Elvis' single Jailhouse Rock became the UK's number one on Sunday. Fans in France celebrated with a tribute concert by Elvis cover bands and a special exhibition of memorabilia is on display in Bonn, Germany.\nJailhouse Rock is now the 999th number one single in UK pop history. Record company SonyBMG are releasing Elvis' 18 number one singles at the rate of one a week in Britain, complete with original artwork and a collector's box. Hit single One Night will follow next week - with the chance of becoming the 1,000th number one as interest surrounding Elvis' birthday grows. HMV spokesman Gennaro Castaldo said: \"It would be a fantastic and truly fitting way to celebrate Elvis' landmark birthday.\"",
    "Public trust in taxes is breaking down because Labour and Tories are not being straight with people on the issue, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.\nA day ahead of the government's pre-Budget report, Mr Kennedy used a speech to say his party was facing up to \"painful economic realities\". He said the current level of taxation was about right, although he would put a new 50% tax on top earners. Other parties have accused the Lib Dems of making uncosted promises. Mr Kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation. The Lib Dems have already published what they say are the full costings for all their plans and Wednesday's speech did not announce new policies.\nSpeaking at the Commonwealth Club, Mr Kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility, both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver. He said. \"Budgets have to add up. Tough choices are needed in public spending.\" The Lib Dems would cut \"low priority\" spending, including the government's ID cards scheme and the Child Trust Fund.\nThose cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over-75s, putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks, he said. The Lib Dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax. Now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new 50% tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees, providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down. There would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the \"polluter who pays\".\nThe Lib Dems say the Tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while Labour has hidden most of its tax rises. Mr Kennedy said: \"That contract with the people - that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely - can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans. \"With the stealth tax strategy of Gordon Brown, the obvious unfairness of our current tax system - especially the council tax, and the empty promises of the Conservative party on this issue - it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down.\" He challenged the Treasury to open up its books so the National Audit Office can report on the government's performance.\nConservative co-chairman Liam Fox said: Liam Fox said \"If Charles Kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their 100 spending commitments. \"The reality is, the Lib Dems lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy, and the only people who would face 'tough choices' would be the families who would be £630 worse off a year. \" And Chancellor Gordon Brown said the Lib Dem figures did not add up. He accused the party of claiming it would spend less while across the country committing itself to spend more.",
    "Former Cabinet minister Clare Short has criticised the US-led tsunami aid coalition, saying the UN should be leading efforts.\nPresident Bush has announced that an alliance of the US, India, Australia and Japan will co-ordinate a humanitarian drive. But Ms Short said the effect of the parallel coalition would be to undermine the UN. She said only the UN had the \"moral authority\" to lead the relief work. Ms Short resigned as international development secretary over the Iraq war. \"I think this initiative from America to set up four countries claiming to co-ordinate sounds like yet another attempt to undermine the UN when it is the best system we have got and the one that needs building up,\" she said. \"Only really the UN can do that job,\" she told BBC Radio Four's PM programme. \"It is the only body that has the moral authority. But it can only do it well if it is backed up by the authority of the great powers.\" Ms Short said the countries involved could not boast good records on their response to major disasters. The US was \"very bad at coordinating with anyone\" and India had its own problems, Ms Short said. \"I don't know what that is about but it sounds very much, I am afraid, like the US trying to have a separate operation and not work with the rest of the world through the UN system,\" she added.",
    "Asian governments and international agencies are reeling at the potential economic devastation left by the Asian tsunami and floods.\nWorld Bank president James Wolfensohn has said his agency is \"only beginning to grasp the magnitude of the disaster\" and its economic impact. The tragedy has left at least 25,000 people dead, with Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and Indonesia worst hit. Some early estimates of reconstruction costs are starting to emerge. Millions have been left homeless, while businesses and infrastructure have been washed away.\nEconomists believe several of the 10 countries hit by the giant waves could see a slowdown in growth.\nIn Sri Lanka, some observers have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. For Thailand, that figure is much lower at 0.1%. Governments are expected to take steps, such as cutting taxes and increasing spending, to facilitate a recovery.\n\"With the enormous displacement of people...there will be a serious relaxation of fiscal policy,\" Glenn Maguire, chief economist for the region at Societe Generale, told Agence France Presse. \"The economic impact of it will certainly be large, but it should not be enough to derail the momentum of the region in 2005,\" he said. \"First and foremost this is a human tragedy.\" India's economy, however, is less likely to slow because the areas hit are some of the least developed. The regional giant has enjoyed strong growth in 2004. But India now faces other problems, with aid workers under pressure to ensure a clean supply of water and sanitation to prevent an outbreak of disease.\nThailand's Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has estimated the destruction at 20bn baht ($510m). Analysts said that figure is likely to rise and the country's tourist industry is likely to be hardest hit. Thailand's fishing and real estate sectors also will be affected by Sunday's 9.0 magnitude earthquake, which sent huge waves from Malaysia to Africa. Malaysia said as many as 1,000 fishermen will be affected and that damage to the industry will be \"significant\", Agence France Presse reported. Rapid rebuilding will be key to limiting the impact of the tragedy. \"In three months, we should rebuild 70% of the damage in the three worst hit provinces,\" said Juthamas Siriwan, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand. The outlook for Sri Lanka is less optimistic, with analysts predicting that the country's tourist industry will struggle to recovery quickly. Tourism is a vital to many developing countries, providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east Asian region, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).",
    "Only one man recognises that robots are a threat to humanity - but that's fine because it only takes one man to save the day in the thriller I, Robot.\nWill Smith co-stars alongside more CGI robots than you can count and as a thrill-a-minute kind of action film, it's perfectly adequate. You'll have forgotten it all tomorrow but you'll have a fun night with the film and all the extras. There is a one-disc version that has commentaries and a Making Of but the two-disc adds more. Unusually for this kind of film, the extras don't solely concentrate on the special effects. They're covered but there's also a general Production Diary and a Post-Production feature.\nRemember the National Lottery's draw machines Arthur and Guinevere? They were more accurate than this glossy Hollywood version of the tale.\nBut as long as you're not expecting a documentary, live with it: King Arthur is a fun, exciting, totally shallow experience and looks excellent. Clive Owen is the brooding king, Keira Knightly rises above her costume and Ray Winstone gives it all some grit. It's at its best in its battle scenes which are well done and are also the best part of the Making Of extra.\nLess flashy than a David Attenborough show and less detailed than a Simon Schama one, the BBC series British Isles nevertheless turned out to be quite engrossing. Admit it, the fact that this is one of the shows Alan Titchmarsh left Ground Force to present did mean that you expected something equally frothy. But Titchmarsh turns out to know his subject and the sight of our present-day landscape being peeled back to reveal the past was fascinating. He's now written an accompanying book, too.",
    "Games aimed at \"casual players\" are set to be even bigger in 2005, according to industry experts.\nEasy-to-play titles that do not require too much time and that are playable online or downloadable to mobile devices will see real growth in the coming year. The trend shows that gaming is not just about big-hitting, games console titles, which appeal more to \"hardcore\" gamers, said a panel of experts. They were speaking before the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas which showcases the latest trends in gadgets and technologies for 2005. The panel also insisted that casual gamers were not just women, a common misconception which pervades current thinking about gamer demographics.\nCasual games like poker, pool, bridge, bingo and puzzle-based titles, which can be played online or downloaded onto mobile devices, were \"gender neutral\" and different genres attracted different players.\nGreg Mills, program director at AOL, said its figures suggested that sports-based games attracted 90% of 18 to 24-year-old males, while puzzle games were played by 80% of females. Games like bridge tended to attract the over-50 demographic of gamers.\nBut hardcore gamers who are more attracted to blockbuster gamers which usually require hi-spec PCs, like Half-Life 2, or Halo 2 on Xbox, also liked to have a different type of gaming experience. \"When hardcore gamers are not playing Halo, they are playing poker and pool, based on our research,\" said Geoff Graber, director of Yahoo Games, which attracts about 12 million gamers a month.\nWith the growth of powerful PC technology and ownership, broadband take-up, portable players and mobile devices, as well as interactive TV, casual gaming is shaping up to be big business in 2005, according to the panel. The focus for the coming year should be about attracting third-party developers into the field to offer more innovative and multiplayer titles, they agreed. \"We are at a time where we are on the verge of something much bigger,\" said Mr Graber. \"Casual games will get into their stride in 2005, will be really big in 2006 and will be about community.\" With more people finding more to do with their gadgets and high-speed connections, casual games would start to open up the world of gaming as a form of mass-market entertainment to more people. Key to these types of titles is the chance they give people who may not see themselves as gamers to dip in and out of games when they liked.\nPortal sites which offer casual games, like AOL, Yahoo, and RealArcade, as well as other games-on-demand services, allow people to build up buddy lists so they can return and play against the same people. This aspect of \"community\" is crucial for gamers who just want to have quick access to free or cheap games without committing long periods of time immersed in £30 to £40 console or PC titles, said the panel. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the CES trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet and which officially runs from 6 to 9 January. The main theme is how new devices are getting better at talking to each other, allowing people to enjoy digital content, like audio, video and images, when they want, and where they want.",
    "Revenues at media group Reuters slipped 11% during 2004, mainly due to the weakness of the dollar, the group said.\nThe company said it was optimistic about growth even as revenues slipped 11% from £3.24bn ($6.13bn) in 2003 to £2.89bn in 2004. Reuters beat profit forecasts, posting a 52% rise in profits for the year to £198m from the £130m seen a year earlier. Reuters also beat its savings target for 2004, delivering £234m of cuts. Under its three-year Fast Forward turnaround plan it had aimed to save £220m during the 12 months to 31 December.\nReuters also managed to slow a decline in underlying revenues to 5.4% from 10.2% in 2003 and cut its debt back to £160m from £610m a year earlier. The news and financial data seller said the year had begun well, adding it expected \"further gradual improvement\" in the second quarter of the year after good January sales. It added it was planning to deliver a further £105m of savings over the coming year - but said it expects to be hit with an £80m restructuring charge to pay for the cost of moving from Fleet Street to new headquarters in London at Canary Wharf. \"Improving customer relationships, more competitive products and continued strong cost discipline position us well for 2005,\" chief executive Tom Glocer said, adding the company was beginning \"to look beyond recovery to growth\".",
    "Engineering firm Balfour Beatty and five railway managers are to go on trial for manslaughter over the Hatfield rail crash in 2000.\nFour people died when a section of rail broke and a high speed train derailed. Balfour Beatty's railway maintenance arm was in charge of the upkeep of the line at Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Balfour Beatty managers Anthony Walker and Nicholas Jeffries, and Railtrack managers Alistair Cook, Sean Fugill and Keith Lea all face individual charges. All five men, along with four others, are also accused of breaches of health and safety laws. Balfour Beatty Rail Maintenance faces a corporate manslaughter charge. It is expected the trial could last as long as a year. The accident, on 17 October 2000, happened when the London to Leeds express came off the tracks at 115 mph, when it was derailed by a cracked section of rail. The accident on the East Coast Main Line sparked major disruption. The overall responsibility for the line was Railtrack's - the company that has now become Network Rail. Those who died in the accident were Steve Arthur, 46, from Pease Pottage, West Sussex; Peter Monkhouse, 50, of Headingley, Leeds; Leslie Gray, 43, of Tuxford, Nottingham; and Robert James Alcorn, 37, of Auckland, New Zealand.",
    "Hollywood actors Samuel L Jackson and Ben Stiller have signed up for Ricky Gervais' new sitcom, the comedian has told BBC News.\nHe said they had both seen the scripts and had agreed to appear in an episode each of the sitcom Extras. They join British stars Jude Law and Kate Winslet who have been booked for guest roles. The comic and actor said he had drawn up an A-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it. \"We wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct,\" Gervais told BBC News.\n\"It's not about the zeitgeist. We wanted people who would still be around in 20 years, not just the winner of Big Brother to take part.\" Gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line. But he has met with Stiller and Jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it.\n\"I didn't want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who haven't even been asked. \"I have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as I'm going to be in a remake of 10 taking Dudley Moore's part. I haven't been approached and I wouldn't take it anyway.\"\nHe said Stiller and Jackson would be playing \"twisted\" versions of themselves in Extras and that the jokes about them \"would sail pretty close to the bone\". Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series, in which Gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars. Meanwhile, Gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book Flanimals which is released in the US in March, around the same time as NBC begin showing the US version of The Office. The film rights to Flanimals have already been snapped up but Gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly. \"A film will happen over the next three years but I don't want it to be a $50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldn't be another Spider-Man or Batman. I would like to do something small on TV with it first.\"",
    "A former FBI agent and an internet stock picker have been found guilty of using confidential US government information to manipulate stock prices.\nA New York court ruled that former FBI man Jeffrey Royer, 41, fed damaging information to Anthony Elgindy, 36. Mr Elgindy then drove share prices lower by spreading negative publicity via his newsletter. The Egyptian-born analyst would extort money from his targets in return for stopping the attacks, prosecutors said. \"Under the guise of protecting investors from fraud, Royer and Elgindy used the FBI's crime-fighting tools and resources actually to defraud the public,\" said US Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf.\nMr Royer was convicted of racketeering, securities fraud, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Mr Elgindy was convicted of racketeering, securities fraud and extortion.\nThe charges carry sentences of up to 20 years. When the guilty verdict was announced by the jury foreman, Mr Elgindy dropped his face into his hands and sobbed, the Associated Press news agency reported. He was led weeping from the court room by US marshals, AP said. Defense lawyers contended that Mr Royer had been feeding information to Mr Elgindy and another trader in an attempt to expose corporate fraud. Mr Elgindy's team claimed that he also was fighting against corporate wrongdoing. \"Elgindy's conviction marks the end of his public charade as a crusader against fraud in the market,\" said Ms Mauskopf. One of the more bizarre aspects of the trial focused on the claims that Mr Elgindy may have had foreknowledge of the 11 September terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Mr Elgindy had been trying to sell stock prior to the attack and had predicted a slump in the market. No charges were brought in relation to these allegations.",
    "Peace protestors have lost a landmark appeal over police actions in stopping an anti-war demonstration days after the start of the Iraq war.\nThey had appealed against a High Court decision that it was not unlawful for police to forcibly turn protestors away near RAF Fairford, Glos, in 2003. The police had also sought to overturn a breach of human rights ruling arising from the same case. Sitting on Wednesday, three Appeal Court judges dismissed both appeals. They were challenging decisions by two judges in the High Court in February this year. It followed action by police, when three coachloads of people were searched and detained on the way to RAF Fairford and forced to return to London under police escort. The demonstrators appealed against a finding by Lord Justice May and Mr Justice Harrison that it was not unlawful for the police to turn the passengers away.\nThe police were urging Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justices Clarke and Rix to overturn the ruling that they had breached the protestors' human rights by detaining them in the coaches. Craig Mackey, assistant chief constable of Gloucestershire Police, said: \"We have always considered that our responses were proportionate and all our decisions on the day were based on intelligence.\" He said no one on the coaches accepted responsibility for items found on the coaches including body armour, a smoke bomb and five shields. \"Given these circumstances, and the fact that RAF Fairford, and other military installations in the UK, had been the scene of increasingly destructive disorder in the weeks preceding this incident, the police commander on the ground made the decision to turn back the coaches. \"From day one we have vigorously defended this decision, which was made out of a genuine concern that if the coaches were allowed to proceed it would have resulted in disorder and criminal damage at RAF Fairford.\" Fairford Coach Action, representing more than 80 people who appealed against the police actions, say they are prepared to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Their action is supported by Amnesty International and Liberty.",

    "Shares in Cairn Energy have jumped 6% after the firm said an Indian oilfield was larger than previously thought.\nCairn said drilling to the north-west of its development site in Rajasthan had produced \"very strong results\". The company also said it now believed the development area would be able to produce oil for more than 25 years. Cairn's share price rose 300% last year after a number of oil finds, but its shares were hit in December following a disappointing drilling update. December's share fall means that Cairn is still in danger of being relegated from the FTSE 100 when the index is reshuffled next month. Cairn's shares closed up 64 pence, or 6%, at 1130p on Thursday.\nBefore Christmas, Cairn revealed that drilling to the north of the field in Rajasthan had been disappointing, which caused its shares to lose 18% in one day.\nHowever, on Thursday, the group said its belief that the path of oil in the area actually moved further to the west had proved correct. \"This area does need more appraisal drilling but it looks very strong,\" Dr Mike Watts head of exploration said. Chief executive Bill Gammell added: \"The more we progress in Rajasthan the better we feel about it.\" Cairn made the discovery after having been granted an extension to their drilling licence in January by Indian authorities. The firm has applied for a 30-month extension to scout for oil outside its main development area, which includes the Mangala and Aishwariya fields where Cairn has previously announced major discoveries. It also said production at its other fields across the globe was likely to surpass levels seen in 2004.",
    "A string of storms, typhoons and earthquakes has made 2004 the most expensive year on record for property insurers, according to Swiss Re.\nThe world's second biggest insurer said disasters around the globe have seen property claims reach $42bn (£21.5bn). \"2004 reinforces the trend towards higher losses,\" said Swiss Re. Tightly packed populations in the areas involved in natural and man-made disasters were to partly to blame for the rise in claims, it said. Some 95% of insurance claims were for natural catastrophes, with the rest attributed to made-made events.\nThe largest claims came from the US, which was struck by four hurricanes, and Japan, which suffered the highest concentration of typhoons for decades plus a major earthquake.\nEurope suffered fewer natural disasters, but 191 people were killed and more than 2,000 injured in March after the terrorist attack on train stations in Madrid. The damages claimed in 2004 eclipsed previous years, including 2001 when the 11 September attacks pushed claims up to $37bn. Swiss Re said it had registered about 300 natural and man-made disasters around the world in 2004. Twenty-one thousand people lost their lives in the catastrophes with a cost to the global economy of around $105bn (£54bn).",
    "Flanker Colin Charvis is unlikely to play any part in Wales' final two games of the Six Nations.\nCharvis has missed all three of Wales' victories with an ankle injury and his recovery has been slower than expected. \"He will not figure in the Scotland game and is now thought unlikely to be ready for the final game,\" said Wales physio Mark Davies. Sonny Parker is continuing to struggle with a neck injury, but Hal Luscombe should be fit for the Murrayfield trip. Centre Parker has only a \"slim chance\" of being involved against the Scots on 13 March, so Luscombe's return to fitness after missing the France match with hamstring trouble is a timely boost.\nSaid Wales assistant coach Scott Johnson: \"We're positive about Hal and hope he'll be raring to go. \"He comes back into the mix again, adds to the depth and gives us other options. \" Replacement hooker Robin McBryde remains a doubt after picking up knee ligament damage in Paris last Saturday. \"We're getting that reviewed and we should know more by the end of the week how Robin's looking,\" added Johnson. \"We're hopeful but it's too early to say at this stage.\" Steve Jones from the Dragons is likely to be drafted in if McBryde fails to recover.",
    "India and Russia are to work together in a series of energy deals, part of a pact which could see India invest up to $20bn in oil and gas projects.\nOn the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals, to be led by Russian energy giant Gazprom and India's ONGC. The Indian firm is also expected to hold talks on Tuesday about buying a stake in assets once owned by Yukos. It is reported to be keen on buying a 15% stake in oil unit Yuganskneftegas. The former Yukos subsidiary was controversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by state-owned energy giant Rosneft.\nRussian media reported that India and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation on Tuesday during a meeting between Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha, Gazprom chairman Aleksey Miller and India's petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar.\nThe agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining facilities in Russia, India and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil, gas and petrochemicals from Russia to India and other countries across Asia. ONGC could invest in gas and oil fields in Sakhalin, in the far east of Russia, and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern Siberia and the Caspian Sea.\nIndia is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies - particularly liquefied natural gas - as domestic demand is growing at more than 5% a year.\nONGC's Mr Raha said the two could work together on joint bids from next year. \"At current oil and gas prices, our cash flow situation is good,\" he told Reuters. \"What we are saying is - Gazprom has a huge amount of gas and we have the money. \"The investment may go up to $20bn or more for a period of five years or so.\"\nRussian news agencies reported that India's petroleum minister Mr Aiyar and Russian energy minister Viktor Khristenko would discuss the future of Yugansk at a meeting on Tuesday. ONGC's Mr Raha declined to be drawn on his firm's reported interest in the company. However, he stressed that ONGC was not interested in a 'loan-for-oil deal' in connection to Yugansk, similar to that concluded recently between Rosneft and China's National Petroleum Corporation. \"China's problem is it has immediate demand and they needed the oil for their coastal refineries. We do not. We would like long-term security through equity participation.\" It is thought that any decision over Yugansk will be delayed until a US court has decided whether to grant Yukos bankruptcy protection. Yukos is suing a host of companies involved in the sale of Yugansk, auctioned off to pay a huge back-tax bill. It has also threatened legal action against any business which has future commercial dealings with its former subsidiary.",
    "Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else's agenda.\" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can't change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves.\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn't going to be there in New York, that's been taken out of the equation.\" \nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.\"",
    "England will have to take on Ireland in the Six Nations without captain and goal-kicker Jonny Wilkinson, according to his Newcastle boss Rob Andrew.\nWilkinson - who had targeted the 27 February match for his international comeback - has been missed by England, not least for his goal-kicking. \"Jonny's not fit yet,\" Falcons chief Andrew told BBC Radio Five Live. \"He won't be fit for Dublin, there's no doubt about that, but he might be fit for Scotland and Italy.\" The 25-year-old has not played for England since the 2003 World Cup final after a succession of injuries. England, who have lost three Six Nations games in a row, wasted a 17-6 half-time lead in their 18-17 defeat to France. Goal-kickers Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley missed six penalty attempts and a drop-goal between them. \"They've probably got two of the best English kickers in the Premiership in Hodgson and Barkley,\" added Andrew, a former England fly-half and goal-kicker.\n\"They're both pretty good kickers. Charlie is a good kicker week-in, week-out. \"But it's all about pressure and unfortunately England are just not handling the pressure at the moment.\" Andrew also blamed England's poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirements and injuries. \"They just didn't have that leadership that would have seen them through. Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations,\" he said. \"I think it is really difficult for Jason Robinson to lead the side effectively from full-back.\" Meanwhile, former England full-back Dusty Hare put England's mistakes down to a lack of mental toughness.\n\"Jonny Wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an 80% kicking success rate,\" Hare told BBC Radio Five Live. \"But natural-born toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do. \"You have to be able to shut out all the outside elements and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts.\" Hodgson, who has an excellent kicking record with club side Sale Sharks, has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late. \"The top golfers don't hit the fairway every time, and it is the same with goal-kicking,\" Hare added. \"You need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over, but great goal-kickers like Jonny Wilkinson come along very rarely.\"",
    "A Labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the Royal Family the same rights as males.\nThe legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the Crown. It would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying Roman Catholics. But the government refused to back Lord Dubs' Succession to the Crown Bill, saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues.\nThe Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, agreed the 1701 Act of Settlement, which governs the succession, was discriminatory but added that \"for all practical purposes its effects are limited\".\nThe changes proposed by Lord Dubs were a \"complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues\", he said. Lord Falconer said there were 22 members of the Royal Family in the line of succession after the Prince of Wales - all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act. \"It is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly. While we wish to remove all forms of discrimination... this isn't the proper form,\" he added.\nHe did not rule out change in the future but said if Lord Dubs' private member's bill was passed by peers, he would urge MPs to oppose it in the Commons. Lord Dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the House of Lords, but urged the government to think again at a later stage. \"We cannot forever say we don't want to change things because it is too difficult,\" he told peers. During the debate, the Labour peer and former minister said: \"The monarchy should symbolise the values of this country. \"What we don't want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times. \"We are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against Catholics.\" But opponents of the bill, including Tory Lord Campbell of Alloway and the Bishop of Winchester, the Rt Rev Michael Scott-Joynt, said it would separate the state from both the Church of England and the Christian faith. Such a \"secular\" state would be markedly \"less tolerant\", Rt Rev Scott-Joynt argued.",
    "Three of the five nominees in the live-action short film category at this year's Oscars were British. For Andrea Arnold, who won the category, Ashvin Kumar and Gary McKendry the past month has thrust them from relative obscurity into the limelight.\nArnold's gritty drama Wasp is about a single mother living on the breadline, while Kumar's Little Terrorist follows a young Pakistani Muslim boy, who gets stuck on the wrong side of the heavily armed Indian border. McKendry's entry, Everything In This Country Must, forces British soldiers and Catholics to challenge their relationship during the troubles in Northern Ireland. Last week, the trio attended an official screening of all the nominated short films at the Academy's headquarters in Beverly Hills. \"I felt so privileged to have a thousand people watching my film on the biggest screen I've ever seen,\" says Arnold.\nSet in her native Dartford, Wasp tells the story of a young mum, who, unable to find a babysitter, leaves her four young daughters outside a pub while she's on a date. The image that sparked the film was that of a wasp crawling into a baby's mouth. \"The other nominees said they made their films for this reason or that - they had something to say. But I just start with an image I can't shake off, work outwards from that and see what comes out,\" she explains.\nSince she presented children's TV shows Number 73 and Motormouth in the 1980s, Arnold has kept a low profile and is having trouble adapting to this sudden onslaught of attention. \"I'm not interested in the publicity. It's not my personality. I'm overwhelmed by all the fuss,\" she said.\n\"It's all a bit like a beauty contest - all the films are great and so different. \"But even though my film has won 30 awards worldwide (including one at Sundance last month), I'd still be proud of it - even if it hadn't won any.\" Asked what the nomination means to her, Arnold says she feels \"flattered and honoured\". \"We've all been overwhelmed by the response and can't get it in perspective yet. I'm still reeling.\"\nAnd she won't commit to an opinion of Hollywood yet. \"I'm just in the middle of it, living moment to moment, day to day.\" But despite her reservations about the Academy Awards and the media frenzy that surrounds it, she accepts that it has opened doors for her. \"People will definitely listen to what I want to do now, and the phone didn't stop ringing for a week after I got nominated.\" As for the future, Arnold firmly believes that you often get a stronger vision of the world with short films. \"You're left more to your own devices, without people interfering as much.\" That said, she is currently working on a feature film with Dogville and Dancer In The Dark director Lars Von Trier.",
    "This year's clutch of Oscar nominees have been the least popular for 20 years according to box office figures.\nIn the US the five nominated for best film have been seen by 50% fewer people than movies in previous years. While the awards are not based on box office popularity there is concern for the ratings of the televised ceremony. \"We don't have a Titanic or a Lord of the Rings out there. I think it's fair to say it does concern us a bit,\" said Academy executive director Bruce Davis. About 51 million people in the US have seen this year's nominees, compared with between 100 million and 118 million in recent years. The last time combined attendance was so low was in 1984 when Amadeus beat The Killing Fields, A Passage to India, Places in the Heart and A Soldier's Story to best picture, when 41 million saw the five films. Last year's ceremony attracted the highest audience in four years as viewers tuned in to see Lord of the Ring: Return of the King sweep the board.\nAnd the show reaped its biggest audience in 1997 when Titanic took home 11 Oscars.\nThe film had taken $500m (£264m) worldwide before the ceremony, and eventually took $1.8bn (£952m). \"Eyeballs starring at the movie screen translates to eyeballs staring at the TV screen,\" said Paul Dergarabedian of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations. \"People like to have a vested interest in what they're watching. \"When Titanic does $1.8bn in worldwide box office, you've got a lot of people with a vested interest.\" Past years have also seen blockbusters such as Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump and Ghost compete for Oscars. The biggest box office hitter among this year's nominees is The Aviator, which has taken $90m (£48m) in the US, although takings in the UK have reached only £7m so far.\nLow-budget move Sideways and Finding Neverland have so far grossed about $45m (£24m) each. The year's biggest blockbusters do actually feature in the Oscar nominees but in the animation category. Shrek 2 and The Incredibles took $436m (£231m) while The Incredibles took $259m (£137m). Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, which took $370m (£196m) in the US, was largely ignored by Academy voters.\nBut many in the film industry do not equate award and box office success. \"I have never equated the Academy Awards with how much money a movie takes in,\" said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution at Universal which released nominee Ray. \"That's the People's Choice Awards. This is not about the public. This is about the industry bestowing awards on what they think are the best films of the year.\"",
    "The former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom has admitted before a New York court that he used to lie to fellow board members.\nSpeaking at the trial of his former boss Bernard Ebbers, Scott Sullivan said he lied to the board to cover up the hole in WorldCom's finances. Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom's collapse in 2002. He pleads not guilty. The firm had been overstating its accounts by $11bn (£8.5bn). Mr Sullivan, 42, has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following Mr Ebbers' trial, where he is appearing as a prosecution witness. Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom's finances.\nIn the New York court on Wednesday, Mr Ebbers' lawyer Reid Weingarten asked Mr Sullivan: \"If you believe something is in your interest, you are willing and able to lie to accomplish it, isn't that right?\"\n\"On that date, yes. I was lying,\" replied Mr Sullivan. Mr Weingarten has suggested that Mr Sullivan is implicating Mr Ebbers only to win a lighter sentence, something Mr Sullivan denies. Mr Sullivan also rejects a suggestion that he had once told fellow WorldCom board member Bert Roberts that Mr Ebbers was unaware of the accounting fraud at WorldCom. The trial of Mr Ebbers is now into its third week.\nUnder 23 hours of questioning from a federal prosecutor, Mr Sullivan has previously told the court that he repeatedly warned Mr Ebbers that falsifying the books would be the only way to meet Wall Street revenue and earnings expectations. Mr Sullivan claims that Mr Ebbers refused to stop the fraud. Mr Ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. WorldCom's problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies. Prosecutors allege that the company's top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period. WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as MCI.",
    "Council tax in Scotland is set to rise by an average of about 4% in the coming year, BBC Scotland has learned.\nAuthorities will decide final figures on Thursday when projected increases will be more than twice the rate of inflation, which is currently 1.6%. The finance minister has urged councils to limit increases but they have warned that they will struggle to maintain services unless funding is increased. They say much additional government money is for new initiatives. Scottish Finance Minister, Tom McCabe MSP, said: \"Last week in parliament I announced an additional £419m for core expenditure to local government in Scotland. \"That's a 5.5% increase and sits against an inflation rate of 1.6%, so I think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint.\" Mr McCabe is also looking for local authorities to become more efficient and save money in coming years. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Sunday Live programme: \"Here in Scotland we have 32 councils who all have their own individual collection systems for council tax, they have their own payroll systems and their own human resource systems.\n\"We think there has to be opportunities there for rationalisation and using the money saved to reinvest in frontline services.\" The councils' umbrella organisation Cosla, which provided BBC Scotland with the indicative figures for next year, warned that councils would face a continuous struggle to maintain services. Mr McCabe has promised them about £8.1bn next year. \"However, most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services,\" a Cosla spokesman said. Cosla says that it is willing to work with the executive on finding efficiency savings but that these will not be enough to maintain services. They say the funding plans for the next three years will see councils lose more of the share of public spending. The Conservatives accuse the Scottish Executive of using the council tax to raise funds because it is too afraid to raise income tax.\nThe Tory finance spokesman, Brian Monteith MSP, said: \"Its a form of disguise... yet again we see that council tax is being used as a way of passing on costs. \"Scared of actually using its three pence income tax that it could put up, what we've seen over the years is more and more burdens being put onto local authorities and the council tax payer having to pick up the bill.\" There are also warnings that unless funding to councils is increased in the next few years then services may have to be reduced. Linda Knox, Director of the Scottish Local Authority Management Centre at Strathclyde University, said: \"With this current settlement the increase is slowing. At the same time, the burdens on councils are greater than they were. \"The settlement figures don't include pay increases and the executive is also requiring a substantial figure - in the area of £325m - in efficiency savings across the settlement period.\" Education will be protected from any cuts but Linda Knox says this will mean other services will suffer. She said: \"In practice, that will mean a 4-5% cut for other services. On the face of it the settlement looks like an increase of about 9.7% but by the time you take into account other factors its probably only about 1% in real terms.\"",
    "Two UK gamers are about to embark on a world tour as part of the most lucrative-ever global games tournament.\nAaron Foster and David Treacy have won the right to take part in a tournament offering $1m in total prize money. The cash will be handed out over 10 separate competitions in a continent-hopping contest organised by the Cyberathlete Professional League. As part of their prize the pair will have their travel costs paid to ensure they can get to the different bouts.\nThe CPL World Tour kicks off in mid-February and the first leg will be in Istanbul. All ten bouts of the tournament will be played throughout 2005, each one in a different country. At each stop $50,000 in prize money will be up for grabs. The tournament champion for each leg of the CPL World Tour will walk away with a $15,000 prize. The winner of the grand final will get a prize purse of $150,000 from a total pot of $500,000.\nWinners of each stage of the tour automatically get a place at the next stop. The world tour stops are open to any keen gamer that registers. Online registration for the first stop opens this weekend. Some pro-players are winning a spot at the tour destinations through qualifying events organised by CPL partners. Winners at these qualifiers get seeded higher in the elimination parts of each tournament. Mr Foster and Mr Treacy get the chance to attend the World Tour as members of the UK's Four-Kings gaming clan. Towards the end of 2004 Four-Kings staged a series of online Painkiller competitions to reveal the UK's top players of the PC game. The best eight players met face-to-face in a special elimination event in late December where Mr Foster and Mr Tracey proved their prowess at Painkiller. As part of their prize the pair also get a contract with Four-Kings Intel which is one of the UK's few pro-gaming teams. \"There are a lot of people who take gaming very seriously and support their local or national team with the same passion as any other sport,\" said Simon Bysshe who filmed the event for Four-Kings and Intel. More than 80,000 people have downloaded the movie of the tournament highlights. \"Professional gaming is here to stay and will only grow in popularity,\" he said.",
    "High-speed net connections in the UK are proving more popular than ever.\nBT reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. The 600,000 connections take the total number of people in the UK signing up for broadband from BT to almost 3.3 million. Nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. Britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of Europe.\nAccording to figures gathered by industry watchdog, Ofcom, the growth means that the UK has now surpassed Germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. The UK total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people, compared to 6.7 in Germany and 15.8 in the Netherlands. The numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from BT or via the many companies that re-sell BT lines under their own name. Part of the surge in people signing up was due to BT stretching the reach of ADSL - the UK's most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km.\nAsymmetric Digital Subscriber Line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. The standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available. \"This breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas,\" said Paul Reynolds, chief executive of BT Wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. BT Retail, which sells net services under its own name, also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers. This was a slight increase on the previous three months. Despite the good news about growth in broadband, figures from telecommunications regulator Ofcom show that BT faces increasing competition, and dwindling influence, in other sectors. Local Loop Unbundling, (LLU), in which BT rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer's home or office, is growing steadily. Cable & Wireless and NTL have announced that they are investing millions to start offering LLU services. By the end of September more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called Carrier Pre-Section (CPS) services, such as TalkTalk and One.Tel, which route phone calls across non-BT networks from a local exchange. There are now more than 300 different firms offering CPS services and the percentage of people using BT lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%.",
    "A major reform of Brazil's bankruptcy laws has been approved by the country's Congress, in a move which it is hoped will cut the cost of borrowing.\nThe bill, proposed in 1993, has finally been approved by the leadership of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The old law, dating from 1945, gave priority first to workers, second to tax revenue and finally to creditors. The new legislation changes this, giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers. The new regulations will limit payments to workers to 150 times the minimum monthly salary, which is currently $94. The law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy. However, when a firm is declared bankrupt it will gain protection from creditors for 180 days while a recovery plan is worked out.\nThe proposals were opposed in the past by leftist parties, including Mr Lula's Worker Party. They considered that they undermined workers' rights. But President Lula became a defender of the reforms, arguing that the country's bank lending margins were among the highest in the world and were damaging the economy. According to Andreas Adriano of Latin Trade Magazine, the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds. Nevertheless, Mr Adriano said to reduce the basic interest rate the Central Bank needs to change its policy, focusing not only on inflation but also on economic growth.",
    "The International Monetary Fund is to cut its 2005 growth forecast for the German economy from 1.8% to 0.8%, the Financial Times Deutschland reported.\nThe IMF will also reduce its growth estimate for the 12-member eurozone economy from 2.2% to 1.6%, the newspaper reported. The German economy has been faltering, with unemployment levels rising to a seventy-year high of 5.2 million. Its sluggish performance continues to hamper the entire eurozone.\nThe IMF's draft World Economic Outlook - due to be published in April - would point to a marked deterioration in Germany's economy, the FT report said.\nIn September, the IMF had said that German growth for the current year would be 1.8%. The IMF has also revised eurozone forecasts, the paper said, taking into account high oil prices, the strength of the euro and weak demand in many of the world's leading economies. Europe's economic difficulties have been highlighted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which argued in a report published on Tuesday that the continent could only achieve US living standards by freeing up its labour markets. \"The eurozone does not look like it has a self-sustaining recovery,\" James Carrick, an economist with ABN Amro, told the newspaper. \"It is too dependant on the rest of the world.\"",
    "Film star Robert De Niro has returned to the top of the North American box office with his film Hide and Seek.\nThe thriller shot straight to the number one spot after taking $22m (£11.7m) at the box office. De Niro recently spent three weeks at the top with comedy Meet The Fockers, which was at number five this week. Oscar hopefuls The Aviator, Million Dollar Baby and Sideways all cashed in on their multiple nominations with stronger ticket sales.\nIn Hide and Seek, De Niro plays a widower whose daughter has a creepy imaginary friend. Despite lukewarm reviews from critics, the film took more than the expected $18m (£9.5m). \"The element of a real actor in a psychological thriller certainly elevated it,\" said Bruce Snyder, president of domestic distribution at 20th Century Fox. Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby led the Oscar hopefuls with $11.8m (£6.3m), coming in at number three during its first weekend of wide release. The Aviator, a film biography of Howard Hughes that leads the Oscar field with 11 nominations, was at number six for the weekend with $7.5m (£4m). Oscar best-picture nominee Sideways entered the top ten for the first time in its 15th week of release. It came in seventh $6.3 (£3.35m). Last week's top film, Ice Cube's road-trip comedy Are We There Yet?, slipped to second place with $17m (£9m), while Coach Carter fell two places to number four, taking $8m (£4.25m) in its third week. Rounding out the top ten were In Good Company - starring Dennis Quaid and Scarlett Johansson - Racing Stripes and Assault on Precinct 13.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast. In the final quarter of 2004, businesses increased spending on capital equipment and software by 18%, up from 17.5% in the third quarter. Consumer spending grew 4.2% in the final quarter, down from the third quarter's 5.1%.",
    "Albania, Bulgaria and Macedonia has given the go ahead for the construction of a $1.2bn oil pipeline that will pass through the Balkan peninsula.\nThe project aims to allow alternative ports for the shipping of Russian and Caspian oil, that normally goes through Turkish ports. It aims to transport 750,000 daily barrels of oil. The pipeline will be built by the US-registered Albanian Macedonian Bulgarian Oil Corporation (AMBO). The 912km pipeline will run from the Bulgarian port of Burgas, over the Black Sea to the Albanian city of Vlore on the Adriatic coast, crossing Macedonia.\nThe project was conceived in 1994 but it was delayed because of the lack of political support. By signing the agreement on Tuesday, the prime ministers of Bulgaria, Albania and Macedonia have overcome the problem. \"This is one of the most important infrastructure projects for regional, EU, and Euro-Atlantic integration for the western Balkans,\" said Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano. According to Pat Ferguson, President of AMBO, work on the pipeline will begin in 2005 and it is expected to be ready in three or four years. He added that the company had already raised about $900m from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) - a US development agency - the Eximbank and Credit Suisse First Boston, among others. The project has also the support of the European Union. Analysts have said that oil companies like ChevronTexaco, Exxon Mobil and British Petroleum would be happy to find alternative routes to the Bosphorus and Dardanelles Straits.",
    "Rangers are set to loan out-of-favour midfielder Dragan Mladenovic to Real Sociedad, despite the closure of the January transfer window.\nSociedad have been given special permission by the Spanish FA to sign a player due to an injury crisis. Mladenovic will effectively replace former Rangers midfielder Mikel Arteta, who has been loaned to Everton. Sociedad say they will pay Rangers £150,000, with an option to buy the Serbia & Montenegro international. Mladenovic's loan move is subject to him passing a medical. The 28-year-old, who joined Rangers from Red Star Belgrade for £1.2m in the close season, is expected in San Sebastian later this week following his national side's game against Bulgaria. Sociedad are in 15th place in the 20-strong Primera Liga, just two points above the relegation zone. Special permission from the Spanish FA came after an injury to central defender Igor Jauregi. The versatile Mladenovic can also play in the back four. His agent said last month that Rangers had told him to find the player a new club. Mladenovic's time at Ibrox has been plagued with injury and he has made just six starts in six months with the Glasgow club.",
    "European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro.\nThe European single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months. Tacit approval from the White House for the weaker greenback, which could help counteract huge deficits, has helped trigger the move. But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden.\nChina is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar. \"Asia should engage in greater currency flexibility,\" said French finance minister Herve Gaymard, after a meeting with his German counterpart Hans Eichel. Markets responded by pushing the euro lower, in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the G7 industrialised countries next week.

    "US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has given a speech at a Scottish church in honour of the pioneering economist, Adam Smith.\nHe delivered the 14th Adam Smith Lecture in Kirkcaldy, Fife. The Adam Smith Lecture celebrates the author of 1776's Wealth of Nations, which became a bible of capitalism. Dr Greenspan was invited by Chancellor Gordon Brown, whose minister father John used to preach at the St Bryce Kirk church. Mr Brown introduced Dr Greenspan to the 400 invited guests as the \"the world's greatest economist\". Dr Greenspan, 79, who has been in the UK to attend the G7 meeting in London, said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to Smith, whose genius he compared to that of Mozart.\nHe said the philosopher was a \"towering contributor to the modern world\". \"Kirkcaldy, the birthplace in 1723 of Adam Smith and, by extension, of modern economics, is also of course, where your chancellor was reared. \"I am led to ponder to what extent the chancellor's renowned economic and financial skills are the result of exposure to the subliminal intellect-enhancing emanation in this area.\" He continued: \"Smith reached far beyond the insights of his predecessors to frame a global view of how market economics, just then emerging, worked. \"In so doing he supported changes in societal organisation that were to measurably enhance standards of living.\"\nDr Greenspan said Smith's revolutionary philosophy on human self-interest, laissez-faire economics and competition had been a force for good in the world. \"The incredible insights of a handful of intellectuals of the Enlightenment - especially with Smith toiling in the environs of Kirkcaldy - created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual self-interest,\" he said. Following his lecture, Dr Greenspan - who received an honorary knighthood from the Queen at Balmoral in 2002 - was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He later opened an exhibition dedicated to Smith in the atrium of Fife College of Further and Higher Education. Joyce Johnston, principal of the college, said: \"It is very fitting that the world's premier economist delivered this lecture in tribute to the world's first economist.\" Dr Greenspan - who became chairman of the Federal Reserve for an unprecedented fifth term in June 2004 - will step down in January next year. He has served under Presidents George W Bush, Bill Clinton, George Bush, and Ronald Reagan. He was also chairman of the council of economic advisors to Gerald Ford.",

It took £7.2m in three days - eight times more than the number two, Closer. Assault on Precinct 13 was in third. At the same time, US audiences were won over by his new thriller Hide and Seek. In Meet the Fockers, he picks up the role of an uptight father and ex-CIA agent from 2000 hit comedy, Meet the Parents.\nIt is a big leap to his role in Hide and Seek, a supernatural horror in which he plays a widower whose daughter's imaginary friend turns nasty. In the UK box office chart, Meet the Fockers pushed Closer off the top spot while police action movie Assault On Precinct 13, starring rapper Ja Rule, made £750,000 in its first weekend. London Underground thriller Creep was another new entry at six while quirky comedy Sideways, which got five Oscar nominations last week, entered in eighth place. The Oscar nominations do not seem to have had an impact on fans' choices at cinemas. Leading contenders The Aviator, Million Dollar Baby and Ray all suffered substantial drops in takings compared with the previous weekend.",
    "Apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products.\nThe bid to unmask the employees leaking information was launched in December 2004 following online articles about Apple's Asteroid product. Now Apple has won the right to see e-mail records from the three bloggers to root out the culprit. A lawyer for the three bloggers said the ruling set a dangerous precedent that could harm all news reporters.\nApple's lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the Asteroid music product and leaking them to the PowerPage, Apple Insider and Think Secret websites. All three are Apple fan sites that obsessively watch the iconic firm for information about future products. Apple is notoriously secretive about upcoming products which gives any snippets of information about what it is working on all the more value. The lawsuit to reveal the names of the leakers was filed against the Power Page and Apple Insider sites.\nThe separate legal fight with Think Secret has yet to be resolved. In the ruling handed down this week by Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge James Kleinberg, Apple can now get its hands on e-mail records from the bloggers' net providers. In making his ruling, Judge Kleinberg said that laws covering the divulging of trade secrets outweighed considerations of public interest. California has so-called \"shield\" laws which protect journalists from prosecution if what they are writing about can be shown to be in the public interest. The Judge wrote: \"...it is not surprising that hundreds of thousands of 'hits' on a website about Apple have and will happen. But an interested public is not the same as the public interest\". Judge Kleinberg said the question of whether the bloggers were journalists or not did not apply because laws governing the right to keep trade secrets confidential covered journalists, too. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is acting as legal counsel for Power Page and Apple Insider, said the ruling had potentially wide implications. \"Anyone who reports on companies or the trade press should be concerned about this ruling,\" said EFF lawyer Kurt Opsahl. Mr Opsahl said the EFF was planning to appeal against the ruling because the bloggers were journalists and US federal laws stop net firms handing over copies of e-mail messages if the owner of that account does not give their consent.",

R&B star Keys won four awards herself at the Grammy ceremony in Los Angeles. U2, Usher, Norah Jones and Kanye West got three each. West led the race going into the ceremony with 10 nominations.\nCharles' last album, Genius Loves Company, a collection of duets that has sold more than two million copies, was named album of the year and best pop vocal album. His song Here We Go Again with Norah Jones won record of the year and best pop vocal collaboration, while Heaven Help Us All with Gladys Knight picked up best gospel performance. Jones said: \"I'm glad he's getting recognised, because of who he is and how much I love him.\" Actor Jamie Foxx - who is nominated for an Oscar for playing Charles in the hit movie Ray - dedicated a rendition of Georgia on My Mind to \"old friends\". Keys, looking to replicate her Grammys success of 2002, when she won five, picked up best R&B song for You Don't Know My Name and best R&B album for The Diary of Alicia Keys. She also shared the award for best R&B vocal performance by a duo or group with Usher for My Boo.\nUsher's other victories were for best contemporary R&B album for Confessions and best rap/sung collaboration for Yeah!, featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris. Kanye West dominated the rap categories, winning best rap song for Jesus Walks and best rap album for The College Dropout. But in one of the night's biggest shocks, he lost out in the battle to be named best new artist to pop rock act Maroon 5. Vertigo by rock giants U2 won three trophies - best rock song, best short video and best rock vocal performance by a duo or group. One of the other main awards, song of the year, went to US singer-songwriter John Mayer for Daughters. Mayer also won best male pop vocal performance. Britney Spears picked up her first ever Grammy for her song Toxic, which was named best dance recording.\nRod Stewart also won the first Grammy of his career, getting the best traditional pop album award for Stardust... The Great American Songbook: Volume III. In 2003, Stewart said he was \"astounded\" he had never won a Grammy - but \"they tend not to give it to the British unless you're Sting\". There were few other high-profile British victors this year. Annie Lennox, metal group Motorhead and dance act Basement Jaxx all took home trophies. But Elvis Costello, who had four nominations, and Joss Stone and Franz Ferdinand, who were both up for three awards, got nothing.\nBeach Boys veteran Brian Wilson was another first-time winner - for best rock instrumental performance. \"It represents triumph and achievement in music that I feel that I deserved, and I'm really glad I won,\" he said. A live recording of composer John Adams' 11 September tribute, On the Transmigration of Souls, performed by the New York Philharmonic, won three classical prizes. And former US President Bill Clinton picked up the second Grammy of his career, winning the spoken word award for the audio version of his autobiography My Life.",
    "Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be \"the most accessible browser on the market\", according to its authors.\nThe latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"\nAnother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.\nThe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.",
    "Chancellor Gordon Brown will deliver his Budget to the House of Commons on 16 March, the Treasury has announced.\nThe Budget, likely to be the last before the General Election, will be at about 1230 GMT on that Wednesday, just after Prime Minister's question time. The annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government's taxation and broader economic predictions. The Tories say it is likely the Budget will contain measures to attract votes. The election is expected on 5 May.\nNext month's Budget will be Mr Brown's ninth since Labour came to power in 1997. If a May election is called, there could be as little as 18 days between the Budget and the announcement of a date for the election. A shortened Finance Bill would have to be rushed through Parliament with all-party support to allow the Government to continue collecting revenue.\nThe full Finance Bill, with the Budget measures in it, would then be returned to the Commons after the election, if Labour secures another term in office. Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: \"We can be sure of two things: the Budget will contain measures to attract votes, and it will not contain the £8 billion of tax rises which independent experts say are inevitable if Labour wins the election.\" As Mr Brown announced the Budget date in a short ministerial statement, accountancy firm Ernst & Young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long-term requirements of the economy. \"In the Budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections, taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and, in many cases, taxes were increased soon after the election result,\" said Aidan O'Carroll, E&Y's UK head of tax.",
    "Ronnie Corbett has joined fellow comedy stars Victoria Wood and David Jason in attacking the declining standards of British television programmes.\nSpeaking to the Radio Times, the Two Ronnies star said there is too much bad language and reality TV. \"You get fed up watching shows with not much care and love,\" he complained. Corbett, soon to reunite with Ronnie Barker for a new Two Ronnies series, also criticised quiz shows like the BBC's They Think It's All Over. \"It's just laughing at each other and thinking, 'Aren't we clever?'\" said the 74-year-old comedian. Corbett is the latest comedy star to bemoan the \"dumbing down\" of modern TV programmes. In an interview published in the Radio Times in January, Victoria Wood slated comedian Sacha Baron Cohen for his character Ali G's \"horrible\" brand of \"victim\" humour.\n\"With so many good writers and good performers, it's a shame people can't just write a script and have other people learn it,\" she said. And last week Only Fools and Horses star David Jason criticised British TV for being \"too safe and too cheap\". \"We've got to be careful not to dumb down for the audience,\" he said. \"They shouldn't be sitting at home on the sofa vegetating.\" Corbett said he and Barker were always mindful of their family audience while making The Two Ronnies. \"Our material was good-natured,\" he said. \"We knew what would upset the average man in the street. \"There's a lot of swearing on TV today. They even have documentaries with the f-word.\"\nCorbett goes on to criticise \"reality programmes where they put people in a house for a fortnight and film them doing everything\". The Two Ronnies ran from 1971 to 1987 and attracted 17 million viewers at its peak. Its bespectacled stars will return later this year in The Two Ronnies Sketchbook, which will combine classic sketches with newly recorded material. Corbett claims he and Barker differ from today's celebrities in that they did not allow their success to go to their heads. \"We were never temperamental, fractious or walked out slamming doors,\" he said. \"We were fussy though,\" he added. \"We wanted everything done properly.\"",
    "What have the European Indoor trials told us? Well, I think we could be heading to the European Championships with half a dozen medal prospects.\nIt was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward, to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around.\nThe best performance on the track for me was Sarah Claxton's win in the 60m hurdles. Running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in Madrid she will be close to picking up a medal. But what was great about Sunday's performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted. Diane Allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and I think she was surprised to be beaten by Sarah. And knowing that she got the better of Diane in a head-to-head race will give Sarah confidence. In the men's race on Saturday, Allan Scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him. In fact, the men's 60m hurdles is so strong, I think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to Madrid.\nPhillips Idowu lit up the field events, not only with his hair, but also with his leap of 17.30m, which puts him at the top of the world rankings. I had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there. He feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him - but then Phillips always has. A lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful, so for Phillips to jump like that is a good performance. He is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further. Across the board I thought Kelly Sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing. She picked up three personal bests in the long jump, high jump and 60m hurdles and you can't ask for more than that. Kelly will be up against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon at the European Championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we've seen so far.\nShe has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well. It wasn't all good news in Sheffield. I thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways. Jason Gardener may have won but he wasn't at his best. I chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off-day for him. He's there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there. In the women's race, Jeanette Kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion Joice Maduaka. The pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but Joice had to pull out with a chest infection. If she had made the final I think Jeanette would have gone a bit quicker.\nJanine Whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two-year drugs ban. But the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn't be the case. The event has moved on immensely since Janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition I think that would help her. A couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding Mark Findlay and Rabah Yusuf. Findlay is a Londoner who has chosen to represent Trinidad and Tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for Great Britain. Yusuf, who came third in the 400m, is from the Sudan but is trying to gain British citizenship. He came to Britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe, started doing more running and found his talent. So we shall have to see what happens to both of them.",
    "Sun Microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour.\nSun Grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by Sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity.\nThe system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said Sun's chief operating officer Jonathan Schwartz. \"Why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?\" he asked in a webcast launching Sun's quarterly Network Computing event in California. The company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil, gas and financial services industries.\nSome of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5,000 processors each, Sun said. Mr Schwartz ran a demonstration of the service, showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. Hundreds of servers were used simultaneously, working on the problem for a few seconds each.\nAlthough it only took a few seconds, the experiment cost $12 (£6.30) because it had used up 12 hour's worth of computing power. The Sun Grid relies on Solaris, the operating system owned by Sun. Initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. It has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in IBM, which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by Sun.",
    "The UK' opposition Conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the General Election. Here's a guide to the plan:\nPeople coming to live and work in Britain from outside the EU. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of TB, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the European Union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical.\nTuberculosis, Hepatitis B and HIV. A positive test for TB would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis.\nPeople would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the UK, or impose significant costs or demands on the NHS. They would also, if appropriate, have to be able to undertake the work or study they applied to come here for.\nPeople coming to Britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care, childcare or teaching. Children and pregnant women wanting to live in Britain permanently would not have to have a chest X-ray for TB. Under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and HIV.\nThe Tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in Britain because of poor health. However, they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases.\nThey claim government figures show that TB in England has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas. They also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into Britain to ensure they are not a public health risk. They say the plans will protect access to the NHS.\nApplicants will be tested in their home country. Only asylum seekers will be tested in the UK once their refugee status is established.\nHome Office Minister Des Browne says the Government already routinely checks people for TB if they come into the UK for six months or more from high-risk countries. Recent medical checks were carried out on 175,000 people at Heathrow Airport and 10,000 at Gatwick. From those tests, about 100 infectious cases of TB were found.\nThe Tories say 47 other countries across the world impose requirements of this kind. The party has looked at the way the system is operated in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The Tory proposals are \"quite closely modelled\" on the New Zealand system.\nLabour claims the policy is little more than a \"desperate attempt to catch up with Labour's five-year plan\" for immigration and asylum, which was published last week. This says health screening for TB will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance. Those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK. The Liberal Democrats have warned Labour and the Tories they were \"in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it\".",
    "US actor Ossie Davis has been found dead at the age of 87.\nDavis, who was married to actress Ruby Dee, was found dead on Friday in his hotel room in Miami Beach, Florida, where he was making a film. Davis, whose 65-year career included credits as a producer, director, actor and writer for stage and screen, was also a civil rights activist. Miami Beach police spokesman Bobby Hernandez said the cause of death appeared to be natural.\nDavis's body was discovered by his grandson and paramedics at the Shore Club hotel in Miami Beach, where the actor had been shooting the film Retirement. Mr Hernandez said: \"After gaining entry, they found Mr Davis had passed away. \"The cause of death appears to be natural. According to his grandson he was suffering from heart disease.\" Some of Davis's best known roles included The Joe Louis Story and Gone Are the Days - a film he adapted from his own play, Purlie Victorious. He also appeared in 7 Spike Lee movies, including School Daze, Do the Right Thing and Jungle Fever.\nHis film debut, in 1950, was in the film No Way Out, starring Sydney Poitier and Ruby Dee. Davis and Dee were married for more than 56 years and together received Kennedy Center honours in 2004 for their body of work. The Actors' Equity Association issued a statement calling Davis \"an icon in the American theatre\" and he and Dee \"American treasures\". Davis was also a prominent figure in the civil rights movement and was a voice for racial equality. He was a featured speaker at the funerals of both Martin Luther King Jnr and Malcolm X. Besides Dee, Davis is survived by three children Nora, Hasna and Guy, a blues artist, and seven grandchildren.",
    "Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer, has died.\nMr Raskin was one of the first employees at Apple and made many of the design decisions that made the Mac so distinctive when it was first released. He led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking. The 1984 release of the Mac reflected Mr Raskin's belief that good design should make computers easy to use.\nMr Raskin joined Apple in 1978 as employee number 31, initially to lead the company's publications department. However, in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use.\nThe result was the 1984 Macintosh that did away with the then common text-based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents. Users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing, clicking and dragging. Although now in common use in almost all computers, these methods were pioneering when first used in the Macintosh. The GUI was developed by Xerox PARC, and used in its Star machine. But the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by Apple in its pioneering Lisa computer. \"His role on the Macintosh was the initiator of the project, so it wouldn't be here if it weren't for him,\" said Andy Hertzfeld, an early Macintosh team member. Although Mr Raskin drove the team that created the Macintosh he did not stay at Apple to see it released. In 1981 he was removed from the project following a dispute with Apple's mercurial boss Steve Jobs. In 1982, Mr Raskin left Apple entirely. The Macintosh was reputedly named after Mr Raskin's favourite apple, though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company. After leaving Apple, Mr Raskin founded another company called Information Appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers. He was also an accomplished musician, played three instruments and conducted San Francisco's Chamber Opera Society. Mr Raskin was diagnosed in December 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 February at his home in California.",
    "Shares in Europe's leading reinsurers and travel firms have fallen as the scale of the damage wrought by tsunamis across south Asia has become apparent.\nMore than 23,000 people have been killed following a massive underwater earthquake and many of the worst hit areas are popular tourist destinations. Reisurance firms such as Swiss Re and Munich Re lost value as investors worried about rebuilding costs. But the disaster has little impact on stock markets in the US and Asia.\nCurrencies including the Thai baht and Indonesian rupiah weakened as analysts warned that economic growth may slow. \"It came at the worst possible time,\" said Hans Goetti, a Singapore-based fund manager. \"The impact on the tourist industry is pretty devastating, especially in Thailand.\" Travel-related shares dropped in Europe, with companies such as Germany's TUI and Lufthansa and France's Club Mediterranne sliding. Insurers and reinsurance firms were also under pressure in Europe.\nShares in Munich Re and Swiss Re - the world's two biggest reinsurers - both fell 1.7% as the market speculated about the cost of rebuilding in Asia. Zurich Financial, Allianz and Axa also suffered a decline in value.\nHowever, their losses were much smaller, reflecting the market's view that reinsurers were likely to pick up the bulk of the costs. Worries about the size of insurance liabilities dragged European shares down, although the impact was exacerbated by light post-Christmas trading. Germany's benchmark Dax index closed the day 16.29 points lower at 3.817.69 while France's Cac index of leading shares fell 5.07 points to 3.817.69. Investors pointed out, however, that declines probably would be industry specific, with the travel and insurance firms hit hardest. \"It's still too early for concrete damage figures,\" Swiss Re's spokesman Floiran Woest told Associated Press. \"That also has to do with the fact that the damage is very widely spread geographically.\"\nThe unfolding scale of the disaster in south Asia had little immediate impact on US shares, however. The Dow Jones index had risen 20.54 points, or 0.2%, to 10,847.66 by late morning as analsyts were cheered by more encouraging reports from retailers about post-Christmas sales. In Asian markets, adjustments were made quickly to account for lower earnings and the cost of repairs. Thai Airways shed almost 4%. The country relies on tourism for about 6% of its total economy. Singapore Airlines dropped 2.6%. About 5% of Singapore's annual gross domestic product (GDP) comes from tourism. Malaysia's budget airline, AirAsia fell 2.9%. Resort operator Tanco Holdings slumped 5%.\nTravel companies also took a hit, with Japan's Kinki Nippon sliding 1.5% and HIS dropping 3.3%. However, the overall impact on Asia's largest stock market, Japan's Nikkei, was slight. Shares fell just 0.03%. Concerns about the strength of economic growth going forward weighed on the currency markets. The Indonesian rupiah lost as much as 0.6% against the US dollar, before bouncing back slightly to trade at 9,300. The Thai baht lost 0.3% against the US currency, trading at 39.10. In India, where more than 2,000 people are thought to have died, the rupee shed 0.1% against the dollar Analysts said that it was difficult to predict the total cost of the disaster and warned that share prices and currencies would come under increasing pressure as the bills mounted.",
    "Ocean's Twelve, the crime caper sequel starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, has gone straight to number one in the US box office chart.\nIt took $40.8m (£21m) in weekend ticket sales, according to studio estimates. The sequel follows the master criminals as they try to pull off three major heists across Europe. It knocked last week's number one, National Treasure, into third place. Wesley Snipes' Blade: Trinity was in second, taking $16.1m (£8.4m). Rounding out the top five was animated fable The Polar Express, starring Tom Hanks, and festive comedy Christmas with the Kranks.\nOcean's Twelve box office triumph marks the fourth-biggest opening for a December release in the US, after the three films in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The sequel narrowly beat its 2001 predecessor, Ocean's Eleven which took $38.1m (£19.8m) on its opening weekend and $184m (£95.8m) in total. A remake of the 1960s film, starring Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, Ocean's Eleven was directed by Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh. Soderbergh returns to direct the hit sequel which reunites Clooney, Pitt and Roberts with Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Elliott Gould. Catherine Zeta-Jones joins the all-star cast. \"It's just a fun, good holiday movie,\" said Dan Fellman, president of distribution at Warner Bros. However, US critics were less complimentary about the $110m (£57.2m) project, with the Los Angeles Times labelling it a \"dispiriting vanity project\". A milder review in the New York Times dubbed the sequel \"unabashedly trivial\".",
    "So who, if anyone, is playing politics with the security of the nation?\nMichael Howard has no doubt it is the prime minister who, he claims, is \"ramming\" through Parliament the controversial new anti-terror measures without proper debate. He didn't say so, but the Tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election And they believe Tony Blair is using the issue to suggest the Tories are soft on terrorism. Why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the Tories' offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws, he demanded. The prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the Tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament. Is not the opposition against to the proposed laws \"in principle\", in which case delaying a decision for further debate would be pointless?\nWhat this is really about, believes Mr Blair, is the Tories spotting an opportunity to embarrass, maybe even defeat the government. And that is more important to them than national security. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue. He preferred to state that, as with other issues like ID cards, the government's immediate instinct was authoritarian.\nAs is his habit nowadays, the prime minister was less rough with Mr Kennedy than he had been with Mr Howard - he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the Lib Dems have, once again, just missed the point. Apart from all that, it was electioneering as usual. The very first question to the prime minister from Derby North's Bob Laxton asked him, in effect, if he would carry on the excellent policy of pouring more resources into schools. Later Birmingham's Sion Simon even went so far as to suggest the Tories were such a shower that we should have the general election now. The prime minister almost blushed. This was not the appropriate place to announce election day, he stammered. But can anyone be in any doubt that that announcement is just days away - an announcement coming in the week beginning 4 April for an election on 5 May is where the big money is in the Commons. And perhaps that simple fact alone means everyone is seen to be playing politics with just about everything at the moment.",
    "A Scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results.\nCalled Speegle, it has the look and feel of a normal search engine, with the added feature of being able to read out the results. Scottish speech technology firm CEC Systems launched the site in November. But experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments.\nThe Edinburgh-based firm CEC has married speech technology with ever-popular internet search. The ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web.\nAccording to search engine Ask Jeeves, around 80% of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net. People visiting Speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the BBC and Reuters. \"It is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad,\" said Speegle founder Gordon Renton. \"The system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else. \"We are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people, although the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) is looking at the technology,\" he added. But Julie Howell, digital policy manager at the RNIB, expressed doubts over whether Speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people's experience of the web. \"There are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be,\" she said. \"Blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way,\" she added.\nThe site uses a technology dubbed PanaVox, which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech. In the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but CEC says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dial-up connections. Visitors to Speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known, if silent, search engine Google. Google has no connection with Speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments, said Mr Renton. \"It is not a rip-off. We are doing something that Google does not do and is not planning to do and there is truth in the saying that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,\" he said. Speegle is proving popular with those learning English in countries such as Japan and China. \"The site is bombarded by people just listening to the words. The repetition could be useful although they may all end up talking like robots,\" said Mr Renton.",
    "Japan's box office received a 3.8% boost last year, with ticket sales worth 211bn yen (£1.08bn).\nThe surge was led by animated movie Howl's Moving Castle, which took 20bn yen (£102m) to become the biggest film in Japan in 2004. It is expected to match the 30.7bn yen (£157m) record of Hayao Miyazaki's previous film Spirited Away. Japan Motion Picture Producers figures showed that 170 million cinema admissions were made in Japan in 2004. The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, was the biggest foreign movie hit in Japan last year, taking 13.8bn yen (£70.7m).\nIt was followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Finding Nemo and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The second highest-grossing Japanese film was romantic drama Crying Out Love in the Centre of the World, followed by Be With You and Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation. Japanese films accounted for 37.5% of Japan's box office total last year, with foreign films taking the remaining 62.5%. This represented a 4.5% gain for the proportion of Japanese films in 2004 compared to 2003. The number of Japanese films released rose to 310 in 2004 from 287 the previous year. Sales of movies on DVD and video amounted to 497bn yen (£2.54bn) for the year.",
    "The Tories say ministers must respond in Parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the Iraq war was drawn up at Number 10.\nDowning Street has denied the claims, made in a new book about the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith's advice. Lord Goldsmith also denied them, saying he was not \"leaned on\" in any way. But the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General.\nThe government has consistently refused to publish Lord Goldsmith's advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.\nBut a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action. It said it was \"plain\" Iraq continued to be in material breach of UN resolution 1441. In his new book, Lawless World, Philippe Sands, a QC and international law professor, suggests the parliamentary answer was written in Downing Street. According to Mr Sands, Lord Goldsmith had warned Tony Blair in a document on 7 March 2003 that the use of force against Iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.\nMr Sands told Newsnight the government had prepared a legal team to be able to defend its case, in case legal action was taken against the UK over the war. On 10 March, military chiefs reportedly asked for an unequivocal statement about the legality of the war to make sure troops could be defended in a court of law. The book, being serialised in the Guardian newspaper, says on 13 March Lord Goldsmith met then Home Office Minister Lord Falconer and Downing Street adviser Baroness Morgan. \"After that Downing Street proceeded to set out his [Lord Goldsmith's] view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on 17 March,\" said Mr Sands.\nTory leader Michael Howard reiterated calls for the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General, warning: \"This issue will not go away.\" \"These revelations throw an intensive spotlight on to the cavalier way in which this government operates - even on an issue as important as peace and war. \"The government needs to act to restore public confidence and trust.\" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell repeated his party's calls for Lord Goldsmith's first piece of legal advice to be made public. \"The public interest, which the government claims justifies non-publication of the whole of the advice, can only be served now by the fullest disclosure.\"\nIn a statement to Newsnight, Lord Goldsmith said: \"In my parliamentary answer on March 17 2003, I explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing Security Council resolutions. \"It was certainly not a view that I expressed as a result of being leaned on in any way, nor as I have already made clear, was it written by or at Number 10.\" The prime minister's official spokesman also rejected the claims, saying: \"The attorney general made it clear the words and the judgement were his.\" But ex-foreign secretary Robin Cook says all the advice should now be published. He said the claims suggested Parliament had only received a pr&#233;cis of Lord Goldsmith's second opinion - and that it was actually drafted in No 10. This would be wrong even if Lord Goldsmith had signed the statement, Mr Cook said, because the attorney general's advice should be an \"independent legal opinion\", not subject to \"political negotiation of this kind\".",
    "The growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade has been nothing less than astonishing, but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked. Games, cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years, but 2005 could see another big innovation that won't just see a change in our mobile phone habits - it might alter the way we listen to the radio. Finnish handset giant Nokia has been working on a technology called Visual Radio, which takes an existing FM signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures. It is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested - the early days of DAB Digital Radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day.\nOne problem is that the name Visual Radio leads people to think of television but Reidar Wasenius, a senior project manager at Nokia, was adamant that Visual Radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium. He said: \"I'm very happy to say it's not television, what we're talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today. \"If you have a Visual Radio enabled handset, when you hear an artist you don't know, or there's a competition or vote that you'd like to participate in, you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on-air broadcast you've just been listening to.\"\nThat visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station, and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to. As well as details on the track or artist of a particular song, there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself, in a similar way to digital television's \"red button\" content.\nPossible interactive content includes competitions, votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing. But the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations, who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a real-time basis. This in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue, as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners.\nAs the Visual Radio content is transmitted by existing GPRS technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network. And there will be a cost for the service as well, although it may depend on your usage. \"If you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it'll be two or three pounds per month,\" said Mr Wasenius. \"But typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an 'all you can eat' arrangement per month.\" The payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dial-up connections. One thing that is for sure - assuming that Nokia retains its market share in handsets, it is estimating that there will be 100 million Visual Radio-enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of 2006. \"Basically, Visual Radio is not really revolutionary, but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before.\"\nThe first Visual Radio service in the UK will begin in a few months time with Virgin Radio, who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners. Station manager Steve Taylor commented: \"Listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way. \"Not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like; mp3 music downloads and the latest gig tickets.\" Initially Visual Radio functionality will be limited to two Nokia handsets due out soon - the 3230 and 7710 - but if successful, it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them.\nListen again to the interview on the Radio Five Live website.",
    "Apple has taken more legal action to stop online leaks of its new products.\nThe computer giant has sued three men for releasing preview versions of its latest Mac OSX software onto file-sharing sites prior to its release. It said two versions of the operating system, codenamed Tiger, were put onto the net in October and December. It is the second time in two weeks Apple has taken legal action to protect its future products. Tiger is due to be shipped in early 2005. Last week, it filed a lawsuit against \"unnamed individuals\" who leaked details about new products onto the web.\nThe latest action was against members of the Apple Developer Connection, a group of programmers which gets to see test versions of upcoming software so they can develop or change their own programs to work with them. \"Members of Apple Developer Connection receive advance copies of Apple software under strict confidentiality agreements, which we take very seriously to protect our intellectual property,\" Apple said in a statement.\nIt added that its future financial results were very much dependent on developing and improving its operating systems and other software. It is thought the men used sites which employ BitTorrent technology. With BitTorrent technology, sites do not host actual files being shared, instead they host a link that points people to others that have the particular file. Last week, the Motion Picture Association of America launched a legal campaign targeting websites that operate using the BitTorrent system in an effort to clamp down on movie piracy. Apple is no stranger to taking legal action against those who leak product information. In December 2002, it sued a former contractor who allegedly put drawings, images and engineering details of its PowerMac G4 computer online. The latest action was filed on Monday in the US District Court in California. It comes just weeks before the MacWorld conference in San Francisco, used to showcase new products.",
    "Twenty-eight people, including a Briton, have been arrested after a global operation against a website allegedly involved in identity fraud.\nThose arrested are accused of operating Shadowcrew.com, which investigators claim was a global clearing house for criminals involved in credit card fraud. A 19-year-old man from Camberley, Surrey, was arrested by the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit but has been bailed. Operation Firewall, led by the US Secret Service, involved seven nations. The British teenager was arrested on Wednesday but details only emerged on Friday. He has now been bailed to return to a Surrey police station in December. All 28 people detained globally are suspected of being involved in an internet-based network which stole people's identities and used computers and websites to defraud credit card companies. The authorities in the US, who have indicted 19 people in Newark, New Jersey, estimate the fraud caused losses of more than $4m. Assistant US Attorney Scott Christie said several people had been arrested in Argentina, Bulgaria, Canada, Estonia, Poland and Sweden. Mr Christie said one of the ringleaders was believed to be a Russian, Anatoly Tyukanov.\nInvestigators from 30 law enforcement agencies worldwide spent 15 months looking into the activities of three websites - Shadowcrew, Carderplanet and Darkprofits. The US Secret Service was first tipped off in July 2003. An NHTCU spokeswoman said the American investigators went undercover on the Shadowcrew website and discovered some of the site's 4,000 members were using it for organised crime purposes.\nShe said criminals were using the websites to traffic counterfeit credit cards and false identification information and documents such as credit cards, driver's licences, passports and birth certificates. The websites shared tips on how to commit fraud and provided a forum by which people could buy the information and tools they needed to commit such crime, she said. The Shadowcrew site, which has now been taken over by the US Secret Service, listed several discussion groups, in English and Russian, including one on hacking, spam and online anonymity tools. The head of the NHTCU, Acting Detective Chief Superintendent, Mick Deats, said: \"This investigation has resulted in the significant disruption of organised criminals using the internet for profit.\n\"We believe that the suspects have trafficked at least 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, leading to losses by financial institutions running into the millions.\" Chief Supt Deats went on to warn: \"The internet offers huge legitimate benefits for modern society; however with it brings powerful opportunities for those seeking to abuse those benefits for criminal gain. \"Your identity is one of the most precious commodities. Criminals who try to steal the personal and financial information of ordinary citizens as well as the confidential and proprietary information of companies engaged in e-commerce, will be targeted by law enforcement.\"",
    "Japan's economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to September, figures show.\nRevised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter. On an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought. A common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.\nThe government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data. \"I maintain the view that Japan's economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully,\" said economy minister Heizo Takenaka. But in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead, observers were less sanguine. \"It's painting a picture of a recovery... much patchier than previously thought,\" said Paul Sheard, economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. Improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand, with private consumption up just 0.2% in the third quarter.",
    "Hollywood legend Dustin Hoffman has hit out at the quality of current films and theatre productions.\nThe star of Rain Man and Tootsie said the film culture was \"in the craphouse\" at a press conference on Tuesday. The 67-year-old also said he stopped working a few years ago because he lost his \"spark\" for acting. Hoffman is in the UK to publicise his new comedy, Meet the Fockers, which also stars Robert De Niro, Barbra Streisand and Ben Stiller.\nHe said: \"You go to the cinema and you realise you're watching the third act. There is no first or second act. \"There is this massive film-making where you spend this incredible amount of money and play right to the demographic. \"You can tell how much money the film is going to make by how it does on the first weekend. \"The whole culture is in the craphouse. It's not just true in the movies, it's also true in the theatre. \"Broadway, and now London is the same, special effects are in great demand. It's not a good time culturally.\"\nHoffman also said he stopped working a few years ago and moved into directing and writing. He said: \"I just lost that spark I always had. \"A couple of years ago I didn't like the parts I was getting. \"Studios weren't interested in the kind of films that people of my generation wanted to see. \"I thought I would stop and just try writing and directing. I wasn't aware of the depression that set in.\" Recently, Hoffmann has returned to film, with roles in I Heart Huckabees, Finding Neverland and now Meet the Fockers, which is the sequel to Meet the Parents. Meet The Fockers opens in the UK on Friday.",
    "China has been accused of blocking access to Google News by the media watchdog, Reporters Without Borders.\nThe Paris-based pressure group said the English-language news site had been unavailable for the past 10 days. It said the aim was to force people to use a Chinese edition of the site which, according to the watchdog, does not include critical reports. Google told the BBC News website it was aware of the problems and was investigating the causes.\nChina is believed to extend greater censorship over the net than any other country in the world.\nA net police force monitors websites and e-mails, and controls on gateways connecting the country to the global internet are designed to prevent access to critical information. Popular Chinese portals such as Sina.com and Sohu.com maintain a close eye on content and delete politically sensitive comments. And all 110,000 net cafes in the country have to use software to control access to websites considered harmful or subversive.\n\"China is censoring Google News to force internet users to use the Chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports,\" said the group in a statement. \"By agreeing to launch a news service that excludes publications disliked by the government, Google has let itself be used by Beijing,\" it said. For its part, the search giant said it was looking into the issue. \"It appears that many users in China are having difficulty accessing Google News sites in China and we are working to understand and resolve the issue,\" said a Google spokesperson. Google News gathers information from some 4,500 news sources. Headlines are selected for display entirely by a computer algorithm, with no human editorial intervention. It offers 15 editions of the service, including one tailored for China and one for Hong Kong. Google launched a version in simplified Chinese in September. The site does not filter news results to remove politically sensitive information. But Google does not link to news sources which are inaccessible from within China as this would result in broken links.",
    "Carlos Moya became the first man to successfully defend the Chennai Open title by beating four-times finalist Paradorn Srichaphan 3-6 6-4 7-6 (7/5).\nThe Spaniard then donated his £28,000 prize money to relief efforts for the victims of the Asian tsunami. The final was close throughout, with Thai second seed Srichaphan - the 2003 winner - closing out the first set. But Moya took the second set, before bouncing back from 5-2 down in the decider to force and win a tie-break. Moya confirmed afterwards: \"I'm donating my prize money from this tournament for the tsunami victims, hoping it makes some difference to their lives. His contribution follows pledges by four other players to donate their prize money from the tournament, which went ahead after the 26 December disaster which has so far claimed at least 150,000 lives. Scrichapan said he would donate an unspecified amount for relief work in Thailand, where more than 5,000 people were killed. The ATP has announced that it would contribute the US$25,000 tournament fee to Unicef's emergency relief fund in Tamil Nadu. The ATP Tour's sponsor, Mercedes, said it would also contribute, increasing the ATP donation to US$40,000.",
    "Microsoft has warned PC users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in Windows programs.\nIn its monthly security bulletin, it flagged up eight \"critical\" security holes which could leave PCs open to attack if left unpatched. The number of holes considered \"critical\" is more than usual. They affect Windows programs, including Internet Explorer (IE), media player and instant messaging. Four other important fixes were also released. These were considered to be less critical, however. If not updated, either automatically or manually, PC users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. Many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely, install programs, change, and delete or see data.\nOne of the critical patches Microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some IE flaws. Stephen Toulouse, a Microsoft security manager, said the flaws were known about, and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw, he did not rule them out. Often, when a critical flaw is announced, spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. A further patch fixes a hole in Media Player, Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. Microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month. The most important ones are those which are classed as \"critical\". Its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker Sybari Software as part of Microsoft's plans to make its own security programs.",
    "Allan Scott is confident of winning a medal at next week's European Indoor Championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.\nThe 22-year-old Scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the Jose M Cagigal Memorial meeting in Madrid. \"It was definitely a learning curve and I certainly haven't ruled out challenging for a medal next week,\" said the East Kilbride athlete. The race was won by Felipe Vivancos, who equalled the Spanish record.\nSweden's Robert Kronberg was second, with Haiti's Dudley Dorival in third. Scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. He won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first IAAF Indoor Grand Prix circuit final. \"I should have done better than that,\" he said. \"I felt I could have won it. I got a poor start - but I still felt I should have ran faster.\" Vivancos slashed his personal best to equal the Spanish record with a time of 7.60secs while Kronberg and Dorival clocked 7.62secs and 7.63secs respectively.",
    "Consumers want music rather than movies while on the move, says a report.\nProduced by Jupiter Research the analysis of the portable media player market found only 13% of Europeans want to watch video while out and about. By contrast, almost a third are interested in listening to music on a portable player such as an iPod. The firm said gadget makers should avoid hybrid devices and instead make sure music reproduction was as good as possible.\nThe report concluded that the driving force behind the growth of Europe's portable player market was likely to be music, rather than films or any combination of the two. Barely 5% of those questioned said they wanted a player that could play back both music and movies. Only 7% wanted a player that could handle games and video.\n\"Dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in Europe today despite their high prices,\" said Ian Fogg, Jupiter analyst. Mr Fogg said although video players and smartphones were trying to cash in on this success they faced a tough job because of the compromises that had to be made when creating a dual-purpose device. \"Europeans care most about music playback,\" he said. The report showed that 27% of consumers asked are interested in portable music players. The research revealed that French, 39%, and British, 31%, consumers were most interested in music players. Mr Fogg said portable video players were likely to remain a niche product that would not be able to compete with devices dedicated to music playback.\nA separate report by Jupiter forecasts that the European digital music market will grow to 836m euros (£581m) by 2009. At the end of 2003, the market was worth 10.6m euros (£7.36m). Digital music players will be behind this market growth said Jupiter . Apple's iPod was launched in October 2001, but the portable music player market has been growing steadily since the launch of the Creative Nomad Jukebox in mid-2000. Now consumers face an almost overwhelming choice of high-capacity portable music players that let them store every track on every CD that they own.",
    "The European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.\nPoliticians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. The bill was backed by some hi-tech firms, saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.\nHugo Lueders, European director for public policy at CompTIA, an umbrella organization for technology companies, said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would European inventors prosper. He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. Other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the American system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. But opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation, be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. The proposed law had a troubled passage through the European parliament. Its progress was delayed twice when Polish MEPs rejected plans to adopt it. Also earlier this month the influential European Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of MEPs. To become law both the European Parliament and a qualified majority of EU states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. The latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the EU for re-consideration.",
    "US musical Sweet Charity has cancelled its run on Broadway after poor ticket sales for its early shows.\nStar Christina Applegate had to pull out of pre-Broadway performances earlier this month with a broken foot. Producer Barry Weissler said he was \"deeply proud\" of the show, but said the decision to close it was \"painful but fiscally responsible\". Applegate, who starred in TV comedy Married With Children, had been hoping to make her Broadway debut in the show. The 33-year-old injured herself while performing in Chicago, and had been hoping to recover in time for its official New York opening on 21 April. She had received mixed reviews for performances in Minneapolis and Chicago. Previews of the $7.5m (£4m) show were due to begin on 4 April. Sweet Charity tells the story of Charity Hope Valentine, a dancer who always falls in love with the wrong man.

Media reports in both countries describe the deal as a major step in the ongoing peace process. Mr Straw said he hoped the agreement would make a difference to Kashmiris. The bus service was one of several announcements made after a meeting of foreign ministers of both countries in Islamabad on Wednesday. Kashmiri politicians on both sides of the Line of Control which divides the region welcomed the move.\nIn a statement, Mr Straw said the bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad \"will be able to reunite families that have been divided for decades\". \"This will make a real difference to the lives of Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control,\" he said. \"I warmly applaud the efforts of both India and Pakistan to make this happen. \"This spirit of cooperation will, I hope, lead to many more measures that will benefit all in the region.\"\nOn Thursday Mr Straw was in India visiting Sikhism's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar where he tried his hand at making Indian bread or roti.

Robert Carlos made it 2-0 at the break, smashing home an indirect free-kick. Midfielder Edu reduced the deficit after half-time but Ivan Helguera headed past keeper Antonio Doblas to seal victory for his team. Victory took Real to within six points of leaders Barcelona and Owen is confident Real can close the gap. He added: \"We had several chances against Betis and I think we can get back in touch with Barcelona. \"It is only six points between Barcelona and us and that is nothing.

    "Deutsche Boerse investors unhappy with its London Stock Exchange bid will have no chance to throw out the exchange's management until May, Reuters says.\nThe Sunday Times reported that hedge funds TCI and Atticus were planning to demand the removal of the group's chairman and chief executive. But Deutsche Boerse told news agency Reuters such a move would have to wait until May's annual general meeting. Investors want Deutsche to return cash to shareholders rather than bid. \"We are long-term investors and are experienced in removing management. We are not scared to take this to its conclusion this time,\" Atticus' David Slager told the Sunday Times. However, Deutsche Boerse told Reuters: \"TCI's request for the removal of the supervisory board will be considered at the annual general meeting on May 25.\"\nThe Sunday Times reported that TCI had been drawing up a list of heavyweight executives to replace Deutsche's chairman Rolf Breuer and chief executive Werner Seifert. The group owns more than 5% of Deutsche - more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the German exchange's management. Under German law Deutsche does not need investor backing to make a takeover bid. TCI and Atticus have opposed the LSE bid for some time saying it would destroy shareholder value, and would be better spent on a share buyback. Deutsche is in competition with pan-European bourse Euronext to take over the London exchange. Many commentators have suggested a bidding war between the two could break out. However, any such move would have to wait until March when the Office of Fair Trading completes an investigation into the competition aspects of the pair's takeover proposals.",
    "Six Chris Paterson penalties gave Scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against Italy at Murrayfield.\nCoach Matt Williams' side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led 6-3 at the break. Paterson slotted four more second-half penalties and Scotland were denied a try when wing Sean Lamont's touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass. A late Andrea Masi try was small consolation for Italy, chasing their first away win in the Six Nations. Scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back Paterson. But the more powerful Azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life.\nA series of drives into Scottish territory set up a penalty attempt, missed by full-back Roland De Marigny, and a wayward drop-goal effort from Luciano Orquera. Scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes Italy, after coming up yards short of the line, equalised through a De Marigny penalty. Italy were offered another penalty when Scottish flanker Simon Taylor was offside but the left-footed De Marigny pushed his kick wide. Scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the Italian half and snatched three points from Paterson when an Italian forward handled the ball in a ruck.\nAs the half wore on, both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties, and the period fizzled out with Scotland numerically, if not psychologically, on top. Italy's De Marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright. And Scotland capitalised with a third Paterson penalty on 50 minutes. Williams' side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and, after a couple of probing attacks, Paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap.\nWith the pendulum of possession swinging towards Scotland, Lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from Paterson. Another Paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. But John Kirwan's men had the last laugh when Gordon Ross' attempted clearance was charged down and Masi pounced for the try, converted by De Marigny.\n: C Paterson; S Webster, A Craig, H Southwell, S Lamont; D Parks, C Cusiter; T Smith, G Bulloch (capt), G Kerr; S Grimes, S Murray; S Taylor, J Petrie, A Hogg.\nR Russell, B Douglas, N Hines, J Dunbar, M Blair, G Ross, B Hinshelwood.\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, C Stoica, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni; S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt); A Persico, D Dal Maso, S Parisse.\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, S Orlando, P Griffen, R Pedrazzi, KP Robertson.",
    "The digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories, according to Carly Fiorina, chief of technology giant Hewlett Packard.\nThe job of firms such as HP now, she said in a speech at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged. She said the goal for 2005 was to make people the centre of technology. CES showcases 50,000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005. The tech-fest, the largest of its kind in the world, runs from 6 to 9 January. \"The digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible,\" she told delegates. \"Revolution has always been about giving power to the people.\" She added: \"The real story of the digital revolution is not just new products, but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell.\" Part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content, such as images, video and music. Crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device, such as a digital camera, to others, such as portable media players. A lot of work still needs to be done, however, to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly, she said.\nMs Fiorina's talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle, fashion and personalisation, something she sees as key to what people want.\nSpecial guest, singer Gwen Stefani, joined her on-stage to promote her own range of HP digital cameras which Ms Stefani has helped design and which are heavily influenced by Japanese youth culture. The digital cameras, which are due to go on sale in the US by the summer, are based on the HP 607 model. The emphasis on personalisation and lifestyle is a big theme at this year's CES, with tiny, wearable MP3 players at every turn and rainbow hues giving colour to everything. Ms Fiorina also announced that HP was working with Nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles, which would launch in Europe early this year. The service will let people listen to radio on their mobiles and download relevant content, like a track's ringtone, simultaneously. The service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive.\nAmong the other new products she showcased was the Digital Media Hub, a big upgrade to HP's Digital Entertainment Centre. Coming out in the autumn in the US, the box is a networked, high-definition TV, cable set-top box, digital video recorder and DVD recorder. It has a removable hard drive cartridge, memory card slots, and Light Scribe labelling software which lets people design and print customised DVD labels and covers. It is designed to contain all a household's digital media, such as pre-recorded TV shows, pictures, videos and music so it can all be managed in one place. The hub reflects the increasing move to re-box the PC so that it can work as part of other key centres of entertainment. Research suggests that about 258 million images are saved and shared every day, equating to 94 billion a year. Eighty per cent of those remain on cameras. Media hubs are designed to encourage people to organise them on one box. Ms Fiorina was one of several keynote speakers, who also included Microsoft chief Bill Gates, to set out what major technology companies think people will be doing with technologies and gadgets in the next 12 months. In a separate announcement during the keynote speech, Ms Fiorina said that HP would be partnering MTV to replace this year's MTV Asia music award. MTV's Asia Aid will be held in Bangkok on 3 February, and is aimed at helping to raise money for the Asian tsunami disaster.",
    "Model Caprice and Holby City actor Jeremy Edwards have both left the Celebrity Big Brother house in a surprise double eviction on Friday.\nCaprice, who left in the scheduled fourth eviction having gained just 5% of the public vote, afterwards said: \"I am so happy, I am so glad I'm out.\" Edwards then left in a surprise eviction, with 12% of the vote. Nineteen-year-old Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie is currently favourite to win the £50,000 charity prize. Caprice had been the pre-show favourite to be voted out of the house, with bookmakers Ladbrokes offering odds of 1/5 on her departure. Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush had said she was \"the hottest eviction favourite so far this series\".\nOdds on Kenzie's victory have been slashed from 4/6 to 1/2, although bookmakers have said they are not ruling out a late rally from former Happy Mondays star Bez. The other remaining housemate is actress Brigitte Nielsen. DJ Lisa I'Anson became the third housemate to be voted out on Wednesday when she became the victim of a surprise eviction during a game of hide-and-seek on the Channel 4 show. I'Anson said she was \"glad to be out\" and predicted that Kenzie would emerge as the winner. The winner is due to be announced on Sunday night.",
    "Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger claimed their display in the 3-1 defeat against Bayern Munich was \"our worst peformance in the Champions League\".\nKolo Toure's late goal gives the Gunners hope for the second leg, but Wenger said: \"The only positive is that we are still in the tie. \"The players are really down in the dressing-room. I feel we really turned in a bad performance. \"At 3-0 we faced a real struggle, but 3-1 at least gives us a chance.\"\nGoalscorer Toure was also at fault for two goals, and Wenger said: \"We need to help Toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment.\" Wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself, adding: \"But there is enough time for crying. I could cry - maybe it would be easier - but life goes on. \"In this job, you have good and bad nights. This was a bad night - but I still have confidence in the quality of my players, as well as their spirit and desire.\" But Wenger's Bayern counterpart Felix Magath was in no mood to celebrate either. He said: \"I am far from happy despite the win. My players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal.\n\"Arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf.\" Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann, whose personal rivalry with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn was not helped by the result, said: \"Do I blame myself for the third goal? As a goalkeeper, I always blame myself. \"I just know the goals were very easy against us. In my time here, we have never conceded three easy goals like that - but sometimes it happens. \"It would have been impossible to go through at 3-0 - but with the goal we have chances. Everything is now possible.\"",
    "A slimming aid made from a southern African cactus is set to be developed by UK firm Phytopharm and Unilever.\nAnglo-Dutch food giant Unilever will help the pharmaceutical firm develop the snacks containing Hoodia extract. Phytopharm shares jumped 10.7% on the news, with analysts saying sales of $600m (£309m) a year were possible. The plant, licensed to Phytopharm in 1997, has been used for thousands of years by the Sans bushmen of the Kalahari desert to stave off hunger. Studies have reportedly shown the plant curbs appetite instead of reducing calorific intake like many existing products.\nPhytopharm will receive an initial fee of £6.5m from Unilever - out of a potential total of £21m - as well as future royalties on product sales. Under the deal, production of the Hoodia cactus at Phytopharm's nursery in South Africa will also rise from eight million plants to potentially hundreds of millions, said Phytopharm chief executive Richard Dixey. The firm had initially hoped to market a slimming drug from Hoodia with Pfizer. But the research collaboration came to an end in 2003. Analysts said Unilever could launch the new products in 2007. \"This deal goes a long way to restoring the market faith in Phytopharm's pipeline after the Pfizer exit,\" said analyst Erling Refsum at Nomura.",
    "The government should change the law to give more protection to employees who raise health and safety concerns about their workplaces, the TUC has said.\nIt said data from employment tribunals suggested 1,500 \"safety whistleblowers\" had lost their jobs since 1999. Some firms found it cheaper to sack a worker than to improve buildings or change working conditions, it said. The Health and Safety Executive said it was trying to get workers more involved in helping to make workplaces safer. The TUC figures were drawn from unfair dismissal cases at tribunals were health and safety were the main issue.\nSafety representatives were often ignored when raising concerns because there was no legal duty to respond, claimed the union organisation. General secretary Brendan Barber said: \"It shouldn't be a firing offence to object to unsafe work. \"Workers should not be placed in the situation where they are forced to choose between risking their job or risking their personal health and safety.\" Mr Barber, who said the \"problem is far worse than official statistics show\", called for a legal system that \"protects safety whistleblowers\". He added that workers who are not in a union, as well as casual and migrant workers, \"stand little chance of redress.\"\nRory O' Neill, editor of union-backed Hazards magazine, which conducted the research, said: \"Giving union safety reps more rights in more workplaces is the ultimate win-win. \"Death and injuries at work increased last year, for the second time since the turn of the century. \"It would be a fatal mistake not to take full advantage of the union safety effect.\" The TUC has called on the government to appoint \"roving\" safety reps and to increase spending on health and safety work inspections. The Health and Safety Executive had said that it had launched an initiative to make factories and offices safer, with more worker involvement.",
    "Ireland consigned England to their third straight Six Nations defeat with a stirring victory at Lansdowne Road.\nA second-half try from captain Brian O'Driscoll and 14 points from Ronan O'Gara kept Ireland on track for their first Grand Slam since 1948. England scored first through Martin Corry but had \"tries\" from Mark Cueto and Josh Lewsey disallowed. Andy Robinson's men have now lost nine of their last 14 matches since the 2003 World Cup final. The defeat also heralded England's worst run in the championship since 1987. Ireland last won the title, then the Five Nations, in 1985, but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with Wales. And Eddie O'Sullivan's side banished the ghosts of 2003 when England were rampant 42-6 victors in claiming the Grand Slam at Lansdowne Road. In front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in Dublin, Ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when O'Gara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal.\nEngland took their time to settle but their first real venture into Ireland's half produced a simple score for Corry. The number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the Irish line, racing 25 yards to touch down. England fly-half Charlie Hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left, but almost immediately O'Gara, winning his 50th cap, answered with two penalties in quick succession. England were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes, and Hodgson, the villain at Twickenham, coolly bisected the posts. The first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking, but it was Ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs. A series of probes led by the talismanic O'Driscoll, back from hamstring injury, resulted in a penalty but Ireland chose to kick for touch.\nFrom the line-out, the ball was recycled back to O'Gara, who stroked his second drop-goal, this time off the right upright. As the interval approached, wing Josh Lewsey was the catalyst for England's most promising attack. The Wasps star raced up his touchline and Hodgson's cross-kick put in Mark Cueto for an apparent score, but the Sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker. England began the second half well and had Ireland pinned in their own half. But another English indiscretion on a rare Irish break-out awarded O'Gara a kick at goal, which he missed. England's pressure continued, and a wave of attacks saw centre Jamie Noon dragged down yards from the line before Hodgson landed a drop-goal.\nThe lead was shortlived, however. Ireland raced upfield, deft handling from the backs, including a clever dummy from Geordan Murphy on Hodgson, ending with O'Driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts. O'Gara missed a penalty which would have put Ireland nine points clear, and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when Hodgson's cross-kick was fumbled by lock Ben Kay near the line. Anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high, but O'Gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt. Inside the last 10 minutes, England poured forward, spurred on by scrum-half Matt Dawson, who replaced Leicester's Harry Ellis. But despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the TV replay by referee Jonathan Kaplan - England were unable to pull off a face-saving win. Ireland next face France at Lansdowne Road in two weeks' time before the potential title decider against Wales in Cardiff. England are still to meet Italy at Twickenham, in what is now a wooden spoon decider, and Scotland.\nG Murphy; G Dempsey, B O'Driscoll, S Horgan, D Hickie; R O'Gara, P Stringer; R Corrigan, S Byrne, J Hayes; M O'Kelly, P O'Connell; S Easterby, J O'Connor, A Foley.\nF Sheahan, M Horan, D O'Callaghan, E Miller, G Easterby, D Humphreys, K Maggs.\nJ Robinson (capt); M Cueto, J Noon, O Barkley, J Lewsey; C Hodgson, H Ellis; G Rowntree, S Thompson, M Stevens; D Grewcock, B Kay; J Worsley, L Moody, M Corry.\nA Titterrell, D Bell, S Borthwick, A Hazell, M Dawson, A Goode, O Smith.",
    "Strong sales outside western Europe helped Renault boost its profits by more than 40% in 2004 although the firm warned of lower margins this year.\nFrance's second largest carmaker enjoyed a healthy 43% rise in net profits to 2.4bn euros ($3.1bn; £2.9bn) as sales rose 8% to 40.7bn euros. The firm said strong demand outside western Europe and the good performance of its Megane range lifted its results. Chairman Louis Schweitzer said 2004 had been a \"great year\" for the firm.\nRenault sold more than 2.4 million vehicles in 2004, an increase of 4% on the previous year. Growth came mainly from outside western Europe, with particularly strong sales in Turkey, Russia and North Africa.\nIn total, sales outside western Europe - Renault's core market - rose 16.5%. Japanese carmaker Nissan - in which Renault owns a 44% stake - contributed 1.7bn euros in net income over the year. Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn is to succeed Mr Schweitzer at the head of Renault later this year.\nRenault said the outlook for the industry in Europe this year was \"stable\", with small growth forecast in other regions. The firm will benefit from the launch of a new Clio model in the coming year and the roll-out of the Logan in many markets. However, the firm said it expected operating margins to be lower in 2005, at 4% of sales as opposed to 5%. \"In a sluggish market and an environment impacted by the rise in raw material prices, Renault intends to continue to grow its global sales,\" the company said in a statement.",
    "The Liberal Democrats are promising to raise the stamp duty threshold if they win the general election, in a bid to court first-time house buyers.\nVince Cable, the party's Treasury spokesman, said raising the threshold to £150,000 would prevent over 400,000 home-buyers from paying the tax. He said first-time buyers were being \"squeezed out\" of the housing market. The Labour party said the Liberal Democrats needed to explain how they would pay for the plan. The plan forms part of a wider Lib Dems policy to encourage first time buyers and those on lower incomes into the market.\nUnder the proposals, the average saving for a new buyer would be more than £1,000, according to Mr Cable. \"First time buyers are being squeezed out of the housing market not only by higher house prices but also by being swept into the stamp duty net,\" he said. \"By failing to uprate the stamp duty threshold Gordon Brown has hit first time buyers and those on low incomes the hardest. \"By pledging to increase the threshold to £150,000, the Liberal Democrats will make it possible for many first time buyers to buy a property without facing this tax.\" Paul Boateng MP, Labour's Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: \"The Lib Dems' sums don't add up. \"They can have no credibility until they can say how they would fund their ever growing list of tax and spending commitments.\" Mr Cable will publish his \"Alternative Budget\" on Monday.",
    "Fly-half Jonny Wilkinson has been named as England's new rugby union captain for the three November Tests.\nThe 25-year-old Newcastle star takes over from Lawrence Dallaglio, who retired from internationals in August. England's acting head coach Andy Robinson said: \"He is a natural leader, holds the respect of the squad and is a formidable talent on the pitch. \"And he consistently demonstrates the energy and commitment I feel is essential to be captain of England.\" Robinson added: \"There are several players in the squad I would feel comfortable in calling upon to be England captain but for me Jonny is in every way the right player to take on this challenge. \"Captaincy offers a challenging environment for any player, especially following in the footsteps of Lawrence Dallaglio and before him the World Cup captain, Martin Johnson.\n\"But I am confident Jonny has what it takes to do an outstanding job as we look ahead towards the next Rugby World Cup in France and I look forward to working with him.\" Wilkinson, who has scored 817 points in 52 internationals, kicked the winning drop-goal in the final seconds of extra-time in England's 2003 Rugby World Cup triumph against Australia. But he then missed the entire 2004 Six Nations campaign while recuperating from shoulder surgery, before making his comeback for Newcastle in the Zurich Premiership in August. \"It's the ambition of so many players to one day be captain of England and today I have realised a dream,\" he said. \"I'm honoured Andy wants me to be his captain, and to follow Lawrence and Martin means a lot to me as they are inspirational men who have given so much to England rugby over many years.\n\"Getting my first England cap against Ireland six years ago was something I'll never forget because to play for your country is very special. Taking on the captaincy is another important step in my career and I do so with immense pride.\" Wilkinson made his international debut in the 1998 Six Nations Championship against Ireland when he came off the bench to replace Paul Grayson.\nHe has been a regular in the England starting line-up ever since, played in all three Lions Tests in 2001 and all but one of England's games in the 2003 World Cup. He becomes the 117th captain of England since Fred Stokes held the position in 1871. England's first autumn Test is against Canada on 13 November, followed by the visit of Tri-Nations champions South Africa a week later and then a World Cup re-match with Australia.",
    "The US is poised to push Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a US Department of Energy (DOE) lab. DOE test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The current top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocks up 35.86. Due next week, the Top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world. It is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second. The speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet, yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles.\nThe US Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed, according to the Linpack benchmark. Until the official list is published, however, Blue Gene/L's position will not be confirmed, and there are expected to be some other new entries. But the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement. Surpassing the 40 trillion calculations per second (teraflop) mark has been considered a landmark for some time.\nThe IBM Blue Gene/L is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version, due to be completed for the Livermore labs in 2005. Its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops, and will fit into 64 full racks. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers. The final machine will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. The Earth Simulator has held on to the top spot since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. But in September, IBM said that another Blue Gene/L machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops, marginally surpassing the Earth Simulator's performance. This was achieved during internal testing at IBM's production facility in Rochester, Minnesota, though, so was not an official record. Another giant to enter the fray is Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California. It would be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 teraflops in October.\nSupercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society. Their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, help design better cars, and improve disease diagnosis. IBM's senior vice president of technology and manufacturing, Nick Donofrio, believes that by 2006, Blue Gene will be capable of petaflop computing. This means it would be capable of doing 1,000 trillion operations a second. \"When you get a computer as large as a petaflop, you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world,\" Mr Donofrio recently told the BBC News website.\n\"You can start to be more proactive, more interactive and more innovative.\" One area where Mr Donofrio sees supercomputing - and Blue Gene machines in particular - as crucial is health. He believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st Century: protein folding. \"Health is one of the most important problems, not just mapping the human genome, but also protein structures. \"We are a great believer in simulation. It gives you another tool,\" he said. Once the structures of proteins are understood fully, then drugs can be tailor-made to fight diseases more effectively. Compared with the current fastest supercomputers, Blue Gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compact. Since the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "Tony Blair says his personal standing in the eyes of voters will be \"an issue\" in the general election.\nThe prime minister said he was \"up for it\" as the country waits to go to the polls, possibly in a matter of weeks. He told The Observer government life was a \"constant barrage of attack\" but said he would not stay in charge if he felt unable to contribute. Mr Blair also spoke of meeting many people across the country with concerns about the compensation culture.\nHe said Britain was in danger of needless panic over public safety issues.\nSpeaking amid a flurry of pre-election campaigning, the prime minister said: \"I am an issue, I always will be. Whoever is the prime minister will be.\" He added: \"If you are afraid to take criticism, you should go and do another job.\" Asked if he would quit as leader if he felt like a liability to Labour, he said: \"It's important always not to do the job unless you feel you have something to contribute.\" Whether he still had something to offer, he said, was a judgement for people to make. Mr Blair's assessment is likely to be seen as a signal that replacing him would not bring an upsurge in fortunes for the Labour administration.\nHis comments come as the co-chairman of the Conservative Party, Liam Fox, on Saturday called him \"a disappointment of historic proportions\" as a prime minister. Mr Blair said he had learned from a series of at times tough encounters with members of the public, during question and answer sessions across the country in recent weeks. He pledged to clamp down on Britain's growing compensation culture, which has brought concerns that doctors, teachers and other professionals are being hampered in their work by the fear of frivolous lawsuits.\n\"I was quite shocked to be told by people who were running a nursery that they were worried about letting the kids out into the playground when it was wet in case one of them slipped and fell and they ended up having a legal case [against them],\" he said.\n\"We have got to look at a way of getting people protection on that.\" Mr Blair said the government was also looking at \"how to make sure that legal aid is not abused with actions against doctors and others\", as part of a review being carried out by the Lord Chancellor's Department. And there should be \"real debate\" about the risk posed by public safety threats, he said. \"We are in danger of - depending on whatever is the media campaign of the day - ending up spending literally hundreds, sometimes millions of pounds meeting quite a small risk.\"\nHis comments come after the government announced it is to spend £200m on drugs to treat a possible outbreak of bird flu, and the Sudan 1 food scare. Meanwhile, Commons leader Peter Hain has warned that on the campaign trail he has seen \"dangerous complacency\" being displayed by Labour voters convinced of a general election victory. If Labour voters \"stayed at home\" in marginal seats they could see Tory leader Michael Howard \"coming in the back door to Number 10 with the tradesman's key to Number 10, getting into power\", he added.",

    "Cold weather across parts of the United States and much of Europe has pushed US crude oil prices above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost three months.\nFreezing temperatures and heavy snowfall have increased demand for heating fuel in the US, where stocks are low. Fresh falls in the value of the dollar helped carry prices above the $50 mark for the first time since November. A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday. Opec members said on Tuesday that it saw no reason to cut its output.\nAlthough below last year's peak of $55.67 a barrel, which was reached in October, prices are now well above 2004's average of $41.48.\nBrent crude also rose in London trading, adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close. Much of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. \"The dollar moved sharply overnight and oil is following it,\" said Chris Furness, senior market strategist at 4Cast. \"If the dollar continues to weaken, oil will be obviously higher.\"\nSeveral Opec members said a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. \"I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,\" Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya's oil minister, told Reuters. \"I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel,\" he added. Opec closely watches global stocks to ensure that there is not an excessive supply in the market. The arrival of spring in the northern hemisphere will focus attention on stockpiles of US crude and gasoline, which are up to 9% higher than at this time last year. Heavy stockpiles could help force prices lower when demand eases.",
    "The number of Europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into TV viewing habits, research suggests.\nJust over 54 million people are hooked up to the net via broadband, up from 34 million a year ago, according to market analysts Nielsen/NetRatings. The total number of people online in Europe has broken the 100 million mark. The popularity of the net has meant that many are turning away from TV, say analysts Jupiter Research. It found that a quarter of web users said they spent less time watching TV in favour of the net\nThe report by Nielsen/NetRatings found that the number of people with fast internet access had risen by 60% over the past year.\nThe biggest jump was in Italy, where it rose by 120%. Britain was close behind, with broadband users almost doubling in a year. The growth has been fuelled by lower prices and a wider choice of always-on, fast-net subscription plans. \"Twelve months ago high speed internet users made up just over one third of the audience in Europe; now they are more than 50% and we expect this number to keep growing,\" said Gabrielle Prior, Nielsen/NetRatings analyst. \"As the number of high-speed surfers grows, websites will need to adapt, update and enhance their content to retain their visitors and encourage new ones.\" The total number of Europeans online rose by 12% to 100 million over the past year, the report showed, with the biggest rise in France, Italy, Britain and Germany.\nThe ability to browse web pages at high speed, download files such as music or films and play online games is changing what people do in their spare time.\nA study by analysts Jupiter Research suggested that broadband was challenging television viewing habits. In homes with broadband, 40% said they were spending less time watching TV. The threat to TV was greatest in countries where broadband was on the up, in particular the UK, France and Spain, said the report. It said TV companies faced a major long-term threat over the next five years, with broadband predicted to grow from 19% to 37% of households by 2009. \"Year-on-year we are continuing to see a seismic shift in where, when and how Europe's population consume media for information and entertainment and this has big implications for TV, newspaper and radio,\" said Jupiter Research analyst Olivier Beauvillian.",

    "Johnny Depp, whose latest role was Peter Pan creator JM Barrie in Finding Neverland, is celebrated as one of Hollywood's most maverick talents. Depp has become an unlikely major star, given his preference for taking dark and idiosyncratic roles instead of surefire box office hits. He has had a long-running working relationship with the equally unconventional director Tim Burton. Depp was born in Kentucky in 1963 and at first wanted to be a rock star, playing in a number of bands and supporting acts such as Iggy Pop and The B-52s in Florida. On a visit to Los Angeles, his former wife introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage.\nIn 1984 he started his film career playing a doomed teenager in horror film Nightmare On Elm Street. Two years later he played a soldier in Oliver Stone's Vietnam epic Platoon. But it was TV that first made Depp a star. He played undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the US series 21 Jump Street for three years from 1987.\nIn 1990 he began his partnership with Burton in the dark fairy tale Edward Scissorhands, about a young man with blades for hands. He won plaudits in 1993 for the downbeat film What's Eating Gilbert Grape, where he played a sensitive youth looking after an overweight mother and a retarded younger brother, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Another role under Burton, Ed Wood, starred Depp as the crazed cult film-maker Wood, in 1994. He played a much more serious, sensitive role in his next major film, Donnie Brasco, where he portrayed an undercover cop infiltrating a mafia ring. In 1997 he directed his only film to date - The Brave, the story of an Indian man offered money to appear in a snuff film.\nTwo years later he played Hunter S Thompson in Terry Gilliam's ambitious but poorly-received big screen adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. He worked again with Tim Burton in the 1999 horror film Sleepy Hollow, and appeared opposite Dame Judi Dench and Juliette Binoche in Chocolat. His performance in Pirates of the Caribbean, which earned him Golden Globe and Bafta nominations, had many critics thinking he based it upon the mannerisms of his friend, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. His latest role in Finding Neverland explored JM Barrie's relationship with Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her children. Depp's charismatic performance drew an audience of adults and children alike into Barrie's vivid imagination, and he was called the \"fifth child of the group\" by the film's director Marc Forster.\nHe has two children of his own with French singer Vanessa Paradis, having previously been in a long-term relationship with British model Kate Moss. The theme of children's literature in Depp's career - and his long association with Tim Burton - are set to continue in his next role, playing Willy Wonka in a remake of Roald Dahl's classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

    "Shares in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts have taken a dunking on Wall Street after the firm revealed it would have to restate its 2004 financial reports.\nThe company warned the move would cut its profits by $3.8m to $4.9m (£2m to £2.6m) - or between 6.6% and 8.6%. Krispy Kreme said accounting errors had forced the move, adding that its board of directors made the decision to restate its accounts on 28 December. However, the company was unavailable to comment on why it had delayed the news.\nIt also warned it might have to further restate results for 2004 and 2005.\nShares in Krispy Kreme sank 14.87% - or $1.83 - to close at $10.48 on the news. The revelation comes just a month after the firm warned earnings would be cut by as much as 7.6% as a result of accounting errors. Krispy Kreme said the latest adjustments involved the way it accounted for the repurchase of three franchise restaurants. It added it would now be reviewing how it accounts for its leases. In a further blow, the firm said it had been advised that some of its franchise owners were not in compliance with their loan agreements, and warned it might need to borrow extra money if it was required to honour agreements on franchisee debts or operating leases.\nKrispy Kreme added that it had enough cash to fund its current operations, but it could not borrow any more under its existing agreements. \"There are many more questions than answers, especially given increased concerns regarding company liquidity,\" JP Morgan Securities analyst John Ivankoe said in a research note on the firm. The announcement is the latest blow for the one-time darling of Wall Street, which has lost 80% of its stock value in just over a year. The firm is currently facing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of its accounts. Shareholders have also launched lawsuits against the group, claiming it made false statements and inflated sales.",
    "Eurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.\nJohn Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election. But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers. UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr Houston knew nothing of his views. The episode comes at a difficult time for UKIP, soon after the high-profile departure of MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be \"made available to law-abiding members of the community\" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. The document reportedly said: \"We're looking for the resurrection of the British Empire. \"The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do.\" Mr Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not. He said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party's manifesto, but would not have been matched to Mr Houston when he was standing to become a candidate. He told BBC News: \"He appears to have said these things. We have suspended him as a member and as a candidate. \"By all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting. \"It is simply a distraction from the task in hand, the EU constitution, not individual idiocies.\" Mr Houston was quoted in the Herald newspaper saying: \"I feel UKIP have over-reacted and overshot the runway.\"\nPeter Nielson, who is UKIP Scotland chairman, said he had suspended Mr Houston on Friday night. \"He will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken.\" He said that any evidence would be looked into and Mr Houston may be interviewed by the party. He added: \"I can't comment too much at the moment, I have one version from him but I haven't seen the papers yet.\"",
    "Newcastle have joined the race to sign Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes and scupper Liverpool's bid to snap up the player, according to reports.\nLiverpool were reported to have bid £3.5m for the 28-year-old Spanish international this week. But the Liverpool Echo newspaper has said Anfield boss Rafa Benitez will avoid a bidding war and instead turn his attentions to Nicolas Anelka. Real are believed to still want £7m before selling Morientes. Monaco are also in the race for the player they had on loan last season. Reports suggest Liverpool will lift their offer to £5m - the highest they are willing to go before bowing out of any deal.\nOn Tuesday, Morientes had said: \"I like Liverpool and I am pleased that a club of their stature want to buy me. I have told Madrid that I want it to happen. \"Madrid know my situation and they know they must do something about me. They must sort out the situation by being sensible. \"I am in a position where I want to play, and I will have to look elsewhere to do that. If Madrid do not want me then it's in the best interests of everyone that they are realistic.\n\"I haven't spoken to Rafa Benitez but I have always appreciated his work and I would like to play for him. But Benitez could yet turn his attentions to the younger Anelka should Morientes be reluctant to pledge his future to Liverpool. Anelka previously played at Anfield under Gerard Houllier before sealing his permanent switch to Manchester City.",
    "Firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all UK phone networks.\nThe rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. The first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. The rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones.\nIn the last couple of years ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. But fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone.\n\"If you are not on the operator's portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it's a problem of how people discover your services,\" he said. To combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. This tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. Mr Flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. Websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. \"What made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently,\" said Mr Flynn. \"People did not know they were being offered a subscription service.\" \"We saw potential for substantial consumer harm here,\" he added.\nThe swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. The drafting of the new rules was led by the Mobile Entertainment Forum and the UK's phone firms. \"Everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct,\" said Andrew Bud, regulatory head of the MEF and executive chairman of messaging firm MBlox.\n\"It's all about transparency,\" he said. \"Consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it.\" \"The consumer has a right to be protected,\" he said. Christian Harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm Zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. \"The groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that's done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out,\" he said. The new rules came in to force on 15 January and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. Some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said Mr Flynn. Also, said Mr Flynn, Vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. \"We have quite draconian contracts with firms,\" he said. \"We do not have to say why. We can just cut them off.\" Under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal \"stop\" command sent via text message. He said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service. \"The mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality,\" said Mr Flynn.",
    "Trouble-hit Mitsubishi Motors is in talks with French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen about a possible alliance.\nOn Tuesday Mitsubishi, the only major Japanese car firm in the red, confirmed earlier reports of negotiations. But a spokesman refused to comment on speculation that Mitsubishi could end up building cars for PSA and perhaps its Japanese rival Nissan. Mitsubishi has been hit by a recall scandal and the withdrawal of support from shareholder DaimlerChrysler. The US-German firm, once a majority shareholder, decided last April to stop providing financial backing. Mitsubishi's sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. Mitsubishi is due to unveil a recovery plan later in January. Analysts said that alliances with other carmakers would be a necessary part of whatever it came up with, not least because its own slow sales have left its manufacturing capacity under-used.",
    "Yukos will return to a US court on Wednesday to seek sanctions against Baikal Finance Group, the little-known firm which has bought its main asset.\nYukos has said it will sue Baikal and others involved in the sale of Yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages. Yukos' US lawyers will attempt to have Baikal assets frozen after the Russian government ignored a US court order last week blocking the sale. Baikal's background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear.\nRussian newspapers have claimed that Baikal - which bought the Yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, £4.8bn) on Sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with Surgutneftegas, Russia's fourth-biggest oil producer. Many observers believe that the unit, which produces 60% of Yukos' oil output, could ultimately fall into the hands of Surgutneftegas or even Gazprom, the state gas firm which opted out of the auction.\nThe Russian government forced the sale of Yukos' most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a $27bn back tax bill it says the company owes. Yukos' US lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of US bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction. On Wednesday, Yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group. \"We believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us,\" Yukos spokesman Mike Lake told Agence France Press. \"If it exports that oil, it will be marketing a stolen product,\" he added. The future ownership of Yuganksneftegas remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that Baikal was established as a front for other interests.\nSpeaking on Tuesday, President Putin said Baikal was owned by individual investors who planned to build relationships with other Russian energy firms interested in the development of Yuganskneftegas. President Putin also suggested that China's National Petroleum Corporation could play a role in the unit's future after signing a commercial agreement with Gazprom to work on joint energy projects. Yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company. Commentators and Yukos itself claim the firm is the target of a government campaign to destroy it because of the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.",
    "Australian tennis coach Tony Roche has turned down an approach from Roger Federer to be the world number one's new full-time coach, say reports.\nMelbourne's Herald-Sun said Roche, troubled by a hip complaint, did not want to travel full-time again. However, Roche is happy to work with the Swiss star on a casual basis and is helping him prepare for next month's defence of his Australian Open crown. Federer has been without a coach since splitting with Peter Lundgren in 2003. Roche, a former Davis Cup player for Australia, won the French Open, reached the Wimbledon and US Open finals and won five Wimbledon doubles titles with John Newcombe.\nHe also coached former number one Ivan Lendl and Pat Rafter to Grand Slam victories and has worked with Australia's Lleyton Hewitt.

Federer was named Swiss sportsman of the year on Saturday, to add to the BBC overseas sportsman and European Sports Journalists Association awards he has already won.",
    "David Miliband's rapid rise through the ranks of government continues with his promotion to Cabinet Office minister.\nElected in a safe Labour seat in 2001 his previous job was school standards minister - a role he won in May 2002. Prior to the last election he was a key figure in New Labour as the head of the Downing Street policy unit where he was a key member of the manifesto writing team. Seen as one of the more intellectual figures in the government, he was also working for Tony Blair in his policy unit when he was leader of the opposition.\nA brief glance at Mr Miliband's family background reveals an impressive socialist pedigree in the form of his father Ralph, who died in 1994. He was an eminent and influential leftwing academic. And while David Miliband is seen as a key Blair lieutenant his brother Ed is a special advisor to Chancellor Gordon Brown. Prior to working for Mr Blair, David Miliband spent time at the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. He then became secretary of the Commission on Social Justice. The 39-year-old was educated at Haverstock Comprehensive before going on to Oxford to study politics, philosophy and economics.

    "Harry Potter director Alfonso Cuaron has signed a three-year deal with Hollywood studio Warner Brothers, according to Variety trade magazine.\nThe Mexican film-maker, who directed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, will produce mainstream movies and smaller Spanish-language films. \"We had a wonderful experience with Alfonso on Harry Potter,\" Warner producer Jeff Robinov told Variety. Cuaron's other films include Mexican movie Y Tu Mama Tambien.\nThe 2001 rites-of-passage drama about two teenage boys who embark on a relationship with an older woman, brought Cuaron international attention - and box office glory.\nIt also won him and his brother Carlos, with whom he co-wrote the screenplay, an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. Warner will distribute Cuaron's films in several languages outside the US. \"This deal will give us the opportunity to collaborate with Alfonso on movies that make the most of his artistry and vision, and continue to offer him the mainstream worldwide audiences that our studio provides so successfully,\" said Mr Robinov.\nHis first film for Warner Brothers was 1995's family fantasy movie A Little Princess. Based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, A Little Princess tells the story of a young girl who is sent to live in a New York boarding school when her widowed father enlists for war. After the erotic nature of Y Tu Mama Tambien, Cuaron was a surprise choice to direct the third Harry Potter film but his dark interpretation was received well by the public and critics alike.",
    "Coronation Street has become the first soap to triumph at the South Bank Show Awards, which traditionally reward highbrow and groundbreaking culture.\nThe soap beat fellow ITV1 show Filthy Love and Channel 4's Shameless to win the best TV drama prize on Thursday. Little Britain was named best comedy while Franz Ferdinand beat Morrissey and The Libertines to the music award. Shane Meadows' Dead Man's Shoes picked up the best film award, beating Shaun of the Dead and My Summer of Love. The two award ceremonies reflect the achievements the industry believes have been made in the last year.\nIn 2004, Coronation Street pulled away from its BBC One rival EastEnders in the ratings and dominated other TV awards. Last year, the South Bank Award for best TV drama went to Steven Poliakoff's period piece The Lost Prince, while Bloody Sunday, about the 1972 killings in Northern Ireland, won in 2003. In other South Bank categories, Little Britain's second series beat Nighty Night and The Green Wing to the comedy trophy while Alan Bennett's The History Boys won in the theatre category. Author David Mitchell made up for losing out in the Booker Prize to Alan Hollinghurst by beating him to the literary award with his book Cloud Atlas.

    "Orange Prize winner Andrea Levy has seen her book Small Island win the Whitbread Novel of the Year Award.\nShe is now favourite to win the overall prize after beating Booker winner Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty. Geraldine McCaughrean has picked up the children's fiction award for the third time for Not the End of the World. All the category winners go through to compete for the Whitbread Book of the Year title, which carries with it a £25,000 prize. A panel of judges including Sir Trevor McDonald, actor Hugh Grant and writer Joanne Harris will meet up on 25 January to decide the overall winner, with the announcement being made later that evening.\nBookmaker William Hill has placed London-based Levy's novel as the 6/4 favourite to win.\nSmall Island, Levy's fourth novel, is set in post-war England and centres on a landlady and her lodgers. One is a Jamaican who joined British troops to fight Hitler but finds life difficult out of uniform when he settles in London. The judges, who included authors Jenny Colgan and Amanda Craig, were full of praise for her writing. \"What could have been a didactic or preachy prospect turns out to hilarious, moving humane and eye-popping. It's hard to think of anybody not enjoying it,\" wrote the judges. The first novel section was won by Susan Fletcher for Eve Green, beating the favourite Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke. Fletcher has recently graduated from graduated from the University of East Anglia creative writing course. Waterstone's fiction writer buyer Suzie Doore said: \"It is great to see Susan Fletcher win in the first novel category. As a relatively unknown author this award will give her exposure to a wider and mass audience that she may not have reached and is a perfect example of the influence of the Whitbread. \"Fresh out of university she is certainly one to watch.\"\nIn the biography category it was John Guy's The Life of Mary Queen of Scots that was picked as winner. The judges called it \"an impressive and readable piece of scholarship, which cannot fail but leave the reader moved and intrigued by this most tragic and likeable of queens\". Guy has published many histories, including Tudor England. He is a fellow at Clare College, Cambridge and became a honorary research professor of the University of St Andrews in 2003.

    "Jason Gardener says being made an MBE in the New Year Honours List underlines the achievement of Great Britain's 4x100m relay squad at the Olympics.\nGardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis have all been awarded MBEs after beating pre-race favourites USA to gold. \"I think this award reinforces what we did on that fantastic night,\" he said. \"This recognition is really inspiring and makes me want to have more success,\" said Lewis-Francis. The British sprint quartet produced a string of faultless baton changes in the final to put pressure on the Americans.\nAnd when the USA stumbled with a poor switch between Justin Gatlin and Coby Miller at the 300m stage, Britain edged ahead going into the final bend. Then, on cue, Lewis-Francis ran a textbook final leg, holding off Maurice Greene to bring Team GB home in 38.07 seconds - just one hundredth of a second ahead of their rivals. \"Winning the gold medal was the highlight of my athletics career so far,\" said the Birchfield Harrier. \"This award is not just for me, but for all my friends, family and the people who have helped me to get to this level in my sport.\" Gardener added: \"All of us had worked very hard for a long, long time to carry off what most believed was an impossible task. \"Of course this award is very special, but for me nothing will ever take away winning an Olympic gold medal. It's all I ever wanted. \"All my life that is what I dreamed of doing. Life since then has been fantastic.\" Campbell agreed receiving the honour capped off what has been a difficult year for the sprinter. \"I think the MBE is important because the people closest to me know my journey,\" said the Newport-based athlete. \"I've not just stumbled upon this. \"It gives me a lot of joy and satisfaction to know the stuff you do for your country does mean something.\"\n- There was also recognition for James Clarke, chairman of the London Marathon.

    "'God games' in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational, says research.\nA US researcher has suggested that games such as The Sims could be a good way to teach languages. Ravi Purushotma believes that the world of The Sims can do a better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods. The inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore, said Mr Purushotma.\nThere must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework. But instead of fearing computer games, Ravi Purushotma believes that educationalists, particularly language teachers should embrace games. \"One goal would be to break what I believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional,\" he said. He believes that the \"phenomenal ability\" of games such as The Sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation. The hard part of learning any language, said Mr Purushotma, were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences. Boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be. \"The way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity,\" he said.\nBy contrast, said Mr Purushotma, learning via something like The Sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all. This was because The Sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players. Instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on. The incidental information about what a Sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning, said Mr Purushotma. By contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context. For instance, he said, in a version of The Sims adapted to teach German, if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word \"energie\" the actions of a tired Sim, stumbling then falling asleep, would illustrate the meaning. If necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players' or students' understanding.\nOne of the drawbacks of The Sims, said Mr Purushotma, was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation. However, online versions of The Sims, in which people have to move in, meet the neighbours and get to know the local town, could be adapted to help this. Although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn, Mr Purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help.\nGetting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid, he believes. Before now, he said, educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games. But, he said, using pre-prepared game worlds such as The Sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game. This could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons. \"I'm hoping now to re-create a well-polished German learning mod for the sequel by this summer,\" he told the BBC News website. \"I'm encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with Japanese and Spanish.\" Earlier work with a colleague on using Civilisation III to teach students about history showed that it could be a powerful way to get them to realise that solving a society's problems can not always come from making a single change. A report on the experiment said: \"Students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play, using geography and history as tools for their game, and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play.\" Mr Purushotma's ideas were aired in an article for the journal Language Learning and Technology.",

It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.\nFor years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference.\nColin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: \"We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. \"Obviously we have failed in that.

    "Controversial new EU rules for the patenting of computer-based inventions have been put on hold due to a last minute intervention from Poland.\nPoland - a large and therefore crucial EU member - has requested more time to consider the issue, especially as it relates to the patenting of software. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small, innovative ones. They say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software.\nPolish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software. The planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the EU should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the US. So, for instance, US-based Amazon.com holds a patent on 'one-click shopping'. Critics claim the law, which the EU says is needed to harmonise with the US, is little more than a law on ideas. \"Patent rights, it is claimed, protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected,\" Eva Lichtenberg, a Austrian Green member of the European Parliament said in a statement. \"Smaller, innovative firms cannot afford the patenting and legal costs that the directive would inflict on them,\" she added. The European Parliament has already clashed with the European Union on the issue and there have been accusations that the process to decide the issue has been undemocratic. The directive has been subject to several previous delays.",

    "General Motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden.\nThe car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster. As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine.\nGM's announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory's closure. The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about GM's planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations. But the group's new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group's Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany. They may now have to face a larger proportion of GM's cuts.\nNeither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market. For years, Saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. The segment's leaders do not agree.\nGM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. In the US, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. Yet it could prove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe. Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe. There, German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market.\nBringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. That is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and Saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year. Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations, GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car. Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers. But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. \"We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today,\" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News. The current trend towards US production was \"stupid\", he said.\nIn a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models. It is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US. GM said it wanted to change \"customers' perceptions\" about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.",
    "The US agrochemical giant Monsanto has agreed to pay a $1.5m (£799,000) fine for bribing an Indonesian official.\nMonsanto admitted one of its employees paid the senior official two years ago in a bid to avoid environmental impact studies being conducted on its cotton. In addition to the penalty, Monsanto also agreed to three years' close monitoring of its business practices by the American authorities. It said it accepted full responsibility for what it called improper activities.\nA former senior manager at Monsanto directed an Indonesian consulting firm to give a $50,000 bribe to a high-level official in Indonesia's environment ministry in 2002. The manager told the company to disguise an invoice for the bribe as \"consulting fees\".\nMonsanto was facing stiff opposition from activists and farmers who were campaigning against its plans to introduce genetically-modified cotton in Indonesia. Despite the bribe, the official did not authorise the waiving of the environmental study requirement. Monsanto also has admitted to paying bribes to a number of other high-ranking officials between 1997 and 2002.\nThe chemicals-and-crops firm said it became aware of irregularities at a Jakarta-based subsidiary in 2001 and launched an internal investigation before informing the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Monsanto faced both criminal and civil charges from the Department of Justice and the SEC. \"Companies cannot bribe their way into favourable treatment by foreign officials,\" said Christopher Wray, assistant US attorney general. Monsanto has agreed to pay $1m to the Department of Justice, adopt internal compliance measures, and co-operate with continuing civil and criminal investigations. It is also paying $500,000 to the SEC to settle the bribe charge and other related violations. Monsanto said it accepted full responsibility for its employees' actions, adding that it had taken \"remedial actions to address the activities in Indonesia\" and had been \"fully co-operative\" throughout the investigative process.",
    "UK airport operator BAA has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.\nThe comments come a day ahead of a High Court challenge by residents' groups and local councils to the government's White Paper. The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. \"We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,\" a BAA spokesman said.\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. Among other measures, BAA has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near Stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.\nAt Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was \"fundamentally flawed\" and did not follow the proper consultation process. \"We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government White Paper,\" said Stop Stansted Expansion chairman Peter Sanders said. HACAN chairman John Stewart said: \"Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare. \"It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. \"Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. \" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February.",
    "Women will be employed in Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry for the first time this year, Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal has been reported as saying.\nThe move comes as the conservative country inches open the door to working women. Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, the de-facto ruler, told government departments to put plans in place for employing women. But progress has been slow, reports from the country say.\nEarlier this week, the local Arab News said Labour Minister Ghazi al-Gosaibi had \"caused uproar\" when he said his ministry was having difficulty hiring women because they demanded segregated offices. The newspaper said many Saudi women found his explanation \"a pitiful excuse for not employing women\". Women now make up more than half of all graduates from Saudi universities but only 5% of the workforce. \"Our educational reforms have created a new generation of highly-educated and professionally trained Saudi women who are acquiring their rightful position in Saudi society,\" Arab News quoted Prince Saud as saying. \"I am proud to mention here that this year we shall have women working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the first time.\"",
    "At the Bafta film awards on Saturday night, there is the prospect that a home-grown movie could walk off with a clutch of trophies.\nVera Drake, Mike Leigh's tale about a 1950s backstreet abortionist, is nominated in 11 categories. These include best film, best director and best actress shortlist for Imelda Staunton who plays the eponymous character. The film has spent months being lauded with prizes, from the Venice Film Festival to five awards from the London Critics' Circle on Wednesday night.\nThe Baftas has a tradition of honouring British cinema, and this year Vera Drake is the obvious candidate to be heaped with praise. Empire magazine's reviews editor Dan Jolin said the film had \"a very good chance\" of doing well on Saturday, predicting that it would collect five or six awards. \"I don't think it's going to do a Lord of the Rings-style sweep, but Imelda Staunton is a shoo-in for best actress,\" he said.\n\"A best director prize for Mike Leigh and best British film are also likely and it could steal some awards from heavily-nominated competitors The Aviator and Finding Neverland.\" Mr Jolin tipped another contender - most likely The Aviator - to walk away with the Bafta for best film, and added that Finding Neverland had been lavished with nominations but not trophies. Strong Oscar contenders Million Dollar Baby and Sideways did not figure in the Bafta nominations, giving Vera Drake greater potential to walk away with the big prizes.\n\"There is a sense that this film is ours and we should slap our own guys on the back. Out of all the films in the running for the Baftas, Vera Drake is the true blue British one.\"\n\"If Mike Leigh is going to win awards for anything, it should be Vera Drake at this year's Baftas\", said Mr Jolin, adding that the film was probably his most technically accomplished and lavish work yet. Mr Jolin also tipped Phil Davis for a best supporting actor prize for his role in Vera Drake but felt that Heather Craney could be outdone by Kate Winslet or Natalie Portman in the supporting actress category. \"If there is anywhere where this film is going to win, it will be at the Baftas,\" he said.\nThe Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw felt that there \"might well be\" a sweep of awards for Vera Drake on Saturday night. \"I hope that Bafta voters will respond to the extremely high standard of acting from the whole cast of the film. If Bafta can't do so, what hope is there?\" he said. Mr Bradshaw felt that Mike Leigh's \"masterpiece\" was entitled to the best film award - leaving Dead Man's Shoes, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, My Summer of Love and Shaun of the Dead to slug it out for the best British film trophy. \"I will be cheering if Vera Drake wins a whole host of awards,\" he added.",
    "Film director Quentin Tarantino is to direct an episode of US television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\nThe Oscar-winning Pulp Fiction director has also written an original story for the season finale episode. CSI's co-producer, Carol Mendelsohn, said the episode would have \"more bugs and blood\" than usual. It is not Tarantino's first venture into TV. In 1995 he directed an episode of the medical drama ER and has also appeared in Alias.\nMs Mendelsohn said the production team had been trying for a while to get Tarantino to direct an episode of CSI, and added that he was a fan of the forensic drama. She said he finally agreed a few weeks ago while CSI was doing some location shooting in Las Vegas and the show's stars persuaded him. \"He knows everything there is to know about CSI, and he is into the whole mythology of CSI,\" Mendelsohn said. \"Quentin came in a couple of weeks ago. We had a story meeting with the writers. \"He had a great idea, and it was so much fun to have him in the room... we are positively giddy.\" Filming is due to start in early April and the Tarantino-directed episode will be broadcast in the US on 19 May.",
    "Comedian Chris Morris, who created controversial TV show Brass Eye, is to return to screens with a new sitcom about a spoof London media worker.\nMorris will direct and co-write Nathan Barley - a character from cult website TV Go Home - for Channel 4. It is a send-up of the stereotypical \"cool\" metropolitan media scene, with Nicholas Burns in the title role. A Brass Eye satire of the media handling of paedophilia sparked 2,500 complaints in 2001.\nNathan Barley will be \"a character-driven comedy\", according to Charlie Brooker, who created TV Go Home in 1999 and has co-written the series. Barley is described as a \"webmaster, guerrilla film-maker, screenwriter, DJ and in his own words, a 'self-facilitating media node\". The story will also feature Dan Ashcroft, a style magazine columnist, and his sister Claire, a film-maker who hates the \"cool\" scene. As well as Brass Eye, Morris was behind another news show satire, The Day Today, and dark sketch comedy Jam. The new show is expected to begin in February.",
    "Tony Blair says his party's next manifesto will be \"unremittingly New Labour\" and aimed at producing \"personal prosperity for all\".\nThe prime minister is trying to draw a line under speculation over the state of his relationship with Gordon Brown with the speech in Chatham, Kent. He is saying that prosperity means both individual wealth and ensuring \"radically improved\" public services. He is also claiming Labour is more ideologically united than ever. Mr Brown is currently touring Africa after a week of facing questions about reports of his splits with Downing Street.\nWith the election widely predicted for May, angry Labour MPs this week warned Mr Blair and Mr Brown about the dangers of disunity. Now Mr Blair is trying to put the focus on the substance of Labour's platform for a third term in government. Labour made low inflation, unemployment and mortgage rates the centrepiece of a new poster campaign this week.\nAnd on Thursday Mr Blair is saying: \"I want to talk about the central purpose ofNew Labour - which is to increase personal prosperity and well-being, not justfor a few but for all. \"By prosperity I mean both the income and wealth of individuals and theirfamilies, and the opportunity and security available to them through radicallyimproved public services and a reformed welfare state.\"\nThe Tories are trying to capitalise on the apparent feud at the top of government. On Wednesday they unveiled a poster which pictured the prime minister and Mr Brown under the words \"How can they fight crime when they are fighting each other?\" Michael Howard and frontbencher John Redwood on Thursday launched new plans to abolish hundreds of quangos. They say government is spending too much and lower taxes are needed to make Britain more competitive.\nThe Liberal Democrats have also claimed infighting its obstructing good government. The latest speculation about relations between New Labour's two most powerful figures came after the publication of a new book, Brown's Britain by Robert Preston. In it he alleges that Mr Blair told Mr Brown in 2003 he would step down as prime minister before the coming general election. The book claims the premier went back on his pledge after support from Cabinet allies and suspicion that Mr Brown was manoeuvring against him. Mr Peston's book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe.\" On Wednesday Mr Blair directly denied Mr Brown made that quote, and before he left for Africa on Tuesday the chancellor told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\"",
    "Greek athletics' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou for missing doping tests.\nThe pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year's Athens Olympics. They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. \"A decision is now expected by around mid-March,\" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos. Kenteris, 31, who won the men's 200m title at the 2000 Sydney Games and Thanou, 30, who won the women's 100m silver medal in Sydney, face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry. The athletes also face a criminal hearing in Greece over the missed drugs tests and have been charged with faking a motorcycle accident on the day of the Athens test, which led to them spending four days in hospital. Following the final hearing in late January, the athletes sounded confident they would be acquitted. \"I am confident and optimistic,\" Thanou had said at the time. \"We presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of.\" It was not clear what this new evidence was.",
    "A judge has dismissed an attempt by Russian oil giant Yukos to gain bankruptcy protection in the US.\nYukos filed for Chapter 11 protection in Houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its Yugansk division by the Russian authorities. The court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of Yugansk, which Yukos claims was illegally sold. Separately, former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky began testimony on Friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion.\nMr Khodorkovsky - who has been in jail for more than a year - pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities. \"I pride myself on heading for 15 years a number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees,\" he told a Russian court.\nYugansk was auctioned to help pay off $27.5bn (£14.5bn) in unpaid taxes. It was bought for $9.4bn by a previously-unknown group, which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state-controlled oil company Rosneft.\nTexas Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of a US presence to establish US jurisdiction. \"The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia,\" Judge Clark said in her ruling. \"Such activities require the continued participation of the Russian government.\" Yukos had argued that a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore lives in Houston. Yukos claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. Russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the US courts.\nIn her ruling, the judge acknowledged that \"it appears likely that agencies of the Russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under United States law\". But she said her role was simply to decide on jurisdiction. The US court's jurisdiction had been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft. Analysts said the ability of Gazprom and Rosneft to trade freely overseas had been stifled while the ownership of Yugansk remained unclear.\nYukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling. However, it claimed that the court had backed its argument in four out of five key issues. \"We believe the merits of our case are strong and simple,\" said chief executive Steven Theede. \"Our assets were illegally seized. We want them back or damages paid.\"",
    "US hip-hop duo OutKast have capped a year of award glory with three prizes at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.\nThey won best group, best video and best song for hit Hey Ya! after getting five nominations. R&B singer Usher won best male and best album for Confessions, while UK rock band Muse were named best alternative act and best British artists. OutKast will add their awards to the four they won at the US MTV Awards in August and three Grammys in February. Not only was Hey Ya! one of the biggest global hits of last year, but OutKast have been widely acclaimed as one of the most exciting and innovative acts in music. Their double CD album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which saw Andre 3000 and Big Boi each produce one disc, was hailed as the album of 2003 by many critics.\nAndre 3000 thanked fans \"for supporting OutKast throughout the years\". \"We really appreciate it,\" he said. \"I hope you don't get tired of us, but we only do what we do.\" Also competing for best group had been the Beastie Boys, the Black Eyed Peas, D12 and Maroon 5. And Anastacia, Britney Spears, Maroon 5 and Ludacris had been on the shortlist for best song.\nOutKast did lose out in the contest for best album - which was won by Usher, another award favourite. Usher, who performed a duet with Alicia Keys, also beat off competition from Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly and Robbie Williams to take the best male crown. He had four nominations going into the ceremony, with seven artists nominated in three categories.\nEminem's group, D12, were surprise winners in the best hip-hop category, beating the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nelly. Eminem told the crowd: \"D12 finally won an award, thank you very much.\" The rapper opened the show with a performance of his songs Like Toy Soldiers and Just Lose It, for which he was joined on stage by a crowd of children. The Black Eyed Peas - who had a global hit with Where is the Love? - picked up the prize for best pop act, beating Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams and Britney Spears. Spears was named best female, sending a message of thanks on video saying the award \"means so much to me\". Alicia Keys, Anastasia, Avril Lavigne and Beyonce Knowles had featured alongside her in that contest.\nLinkin Park singer Chester Bennington described their prize for best rock band as \"quite an honour\" while Muse said their win for best alternative act was \"a real surprise for us\". Muse were also named best UK and Ireland act, ahead of Franz Ferdinand, Natasha Bedingfield, Jamelia and The Streets. Referring to the fact that winners of 11 of the 12 main awards were from the US, Muse singer Matt Bellamy said: \"There needs to be more European bands.\" The 11th annual awards were hosted by hip-hop artist Xzibit and watched by 6,000 people at the Tor Di Valle arena, plus millions more on TV around the world. The ceremony featured performances from the Beastie Boys, who entered the stage on bicycles and skateboards, No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani being lowered from a giant clock and Nelly doing a duet with Pharrell Williams. MTV also organised a huge open-air concert featuring Anastacia and The Cure outside the Italian capital's ancient Colosseum, with some estimates putting the attendance there at 200,000. Last year's big winner at the MTV Europe Awards, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, was Justin Timberlake, who walked away with three trophies.",
    "The UK's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.\nThe Public and Commercial Services Union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions. Unions have already earmarked 23 March for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million UK workers. The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system.\nPCS leader Mark Serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.\n\"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.\" BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented \"a formidable force\" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the General Election. A stoppage involving civil servants, in particular, could seriously disrupt or close government departments, agencies and museums, he said.\nOpposition to raising the retirement age is \"one thing all the unions are agreed on\", our correspondent added. Unison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on Thursday night. Our correspondent said that he understood no deal had been offered in that meeting but that there was room for further negotiations. There was \"some possibility\" of the strike action being avoided, he added.",
    "The world's dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network.\nThe Wolong Nature Reserve in the Sichuan Province of southwest China is home to 20% of the remaining 1,500 giant pandas in the world. A broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas' daily activities. The data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world. The reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology.\nUsing the network, vets have been able to observe how infant pandas feed and suggest changes to improve the tiny cubs' chances of survival.\n\"Digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside Wolong and with the rest of the world,\" said Zhang Hemin, director of the Wolong Nature Reserve. \"Our researchers now have state-of-the-art digital technology to help foster the panda population and manage our precious surroundings.\" The network has been developed by Intel, working closely with the staff at Wolong. It includes a 802.11b wireless network and a video monitoring system using five cameras to observe pandas around the clock.\nBefore the new infrastructure arrived at the panda park, staff walked or drove to deliver floppy disks across the reserve. Infant panda health was recorded on paper notebooks and research teams in the field had little access to the data. To foster cultural links across the globe, a children's learning lab has been incorporated in the network, in collaboration with Globio (Federation for Global Biodiversity Education for Children), an international non-profit organisation. It will enable children at local primary schools to hook up with their peers in Portland, Oregon in the US. \"Digital technology brings this story to life by enabling a global dialogue to help bridge cultures around the world,\" said Globio founder Gerry Ellis.",
    "US banking giant Citigroup has sold its Travelers Life & Annuity insurance arm to Metlife for $11.5bn (£6.1bn).\nThe sale is a further move by Citigroup away from its 1990s strategy of offering every financial service - insurance, broking and banking. Profit growth in the insurance market has not matched expansion at Citigroup's other businesses. For Metlife, the US's leading insurance company, the purchase gives it access to a much larger distribution network.\nRobert Benmosche, Metlife's chairman and chief executive, said that it was a \"great opportunity for the brand of Metlife to be distributed through Citigroup\". Under the agreement, Metlife will be able to sell its products through Citigroup over the next 10 years. The deal includes Smith Barney retail brokerages and Citibank branches. The company will pay between $1bn and $3bn in Metlife stock with the rest being made up of cash. Travelers had sales of $5.2bn in 2004 and made a profit of $901m. It has total net assets of $96bn. \"This deal employs some of Metlife's excess capital in a potentially higher-return business and gives it more distribution,\" said Stuart Quint, an analyst at Gartmore.",

    "Ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming UK general election is fairly run.\nThe move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. A report by two MPs committees called on Thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. But in a written response to Labour MP Gordon Prentice, the government said it would normally invite observers to any UK election.\nJunior constitutional affairs minister Christopher Leslie said: \"I fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced.\" The government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.\nBut trial all-postal ballots in four English regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges \"on a scale not seen since the 19th Century\". Thursday's report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA). It said that, with the growth of postal voting, there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually, rather than by household. It also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so.\nFigures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24, and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll. Young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. ODPM committee chairman Andrew Bennett said individual voter registration, as opposed to registration by household, should be quickly introduced as it could \"dramatically reduce the chances of fraud\". But his counterpart on the DCA committee, Alan Beith, said it should be delayed \"until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective.\" Shadow Constitutional Affairs Secretary Oliver Heald accused the government of \"dragging its feet\" over \"this badly needed measure\". \"It is vital that we move ahead with the Northern Ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the Britain's electoral system,\" he said.\nThe report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in Northern Ireland when it was introduced in 2002. The report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters, but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. It said incentives to register, such as £20 council tax rebate, were likely to be seen as \"gimmicks\" and risked undermining the integrity of the system, MPs said. Instead they called for \"imaginative campaigns\" to boost interest.",
    "The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.\nShe told the Guardian newspaper there would be no \"Las Vegas-style\" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes \"a pile of pants\". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. \"You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots,\" Mr Pound told the Today programme. \"I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,\" he said.\nMs Jowell complained of the \"scale of misrepresentation\" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to \"protect children and the vulnerable\" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: \"We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing.\" And continued: \"We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way.\" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.",
    "The explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005, delegates at the world's largest gadget show, in Las Vegas, have been told.\nThe number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by 11%, while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important. \"Everything is going digital,\" Kirsten Pfeifer from the Consumer Electronics Association, told the BBC News website. The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) featured the pick of 2005's products. \"Consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like HDTVs [high-definition TVs], digital radio, and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005. \"All the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry.\" Despite showing diversity, some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much \"wow factor\" as in previous years.\nThe portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of CES, which was the \"time and place shifting\" of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere, at any time. At the start of last year's CES, the CEA predicted there would be an average growth of 4% in 2004. That figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players, personal video recorders and digital cameras. It was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice, with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed. Part of this has been the rise in spending power of the \"generation X-ers\" who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them. More than 57% of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers, according to CEA research. Hybrid devices, which combine a number of multimedia functions, were also in evidence on the show floor. \"A lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it,\" said Stephen Baker, a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm NPD Group. \"Some of these functions cost next to nothing to add.\"\nAs well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable MP3 players to giant high-definition TVs, several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders, such as Microsoft chief Bill Gates. Despite several embarrassing technical glitches during Mr Gate's pre-show speech, he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the US market. He unveiled new ways of letting people take TV shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices. He disappointed some, however, by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the Xbox games console. Another disappointment was the lack of exposure Sony's new portable games device, the PSP, had at the show. Sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in March for the US and Europe. It went on sale in Japan before Christmas. There were only two PSPs embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details. A Sony representative told the BBC News website this was because Sony did not consider it to be part of their \"consumer technology\" offering.\nElsewhere at the show, there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens, including Samsung's 102-inch (2.6 metre) plasma - the largest in the world. Industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in 2005, with new formats for DVDs coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional DVDs. With so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage, like Seagate's 5GB pocket sized external hard drive, which won an innovation for engineering and design prize.

Mirza, ranked 134 in the world, sunk to her knees in celebration after serving out the match against Bondarenko. \"It is a big moment in my career and I would like to thank everyone who has been a part of my effort,\" she said. \"This win has made me believe more in myself and I can now hope to do better in the coming days. \"I wanted to win this tournament very badly since it was in my hometown.\" At the Australian Open in January, Mirza became the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam before losing to eventual champion Serena Williams.\nAnd a year ago, she became the youngest Indian to win a professional title by claiming the doubles at the Hyderabad Open. Mirza, playing in her first WTA final, began nervously in front of a raucous home crowd - committing three double faults in her opening service game. But from 0-2 down, Mirza broke serve twice in a row and held on to her advantage to take the first set. In a see-saw second set, Bondarenko raced into a 5-2 lead and though Mirza hauled herself level, the Ukrainian broke again before finally levelling the match. Mirza rediscovered the aggressive strokes that took her to the first set in the decider established a 5-2 lead. At 5-3, the stadium erupted in celebration when Mirza thought she had delivered an ace to secure victory but the serve was ruled to have clipped the net. Mirza eventually lost the point but to the relief of the crowd, she broke Bondarenko again in the next game to clinch the title.",
    "Olympic champion Justine Henin-Hardenne will return to action in January's Sydney International tournament.\nThe Belgian has not competed since losing her top world ranking at the US Open in September, where she was beaten in the fourth round by Nadia Petrova. She took time out to shake off a virus but will defend her titles in Sydney and at the Australian Open. Women's world number one Lindsay Davenport and French Open champion Anastasia Myskina will also compete.\nIn the men's event, world number three Lleyton Hewitt returns to defend his title, along with runner-up Carlos Moya. Moya, Spain's Davis Cup final hero in their recent win over the US, had to retire with an ankle injury in the first set of the final.\nTournament director Craig Watson said: \"I had a message relayed to me from him after Spain's Davis Cup victory, saying he was looking forward to trying to make up for his disappointment in the (2004) final. The tournament will take place from 9-15 January.",
    "Wales fly-half Stephen Jones admitted he was happy to hand Gavin Henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against England.\nJones had missed three earlier shots at goal when Wales, 9-8 down, were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in Cardiff. \"I knew the percentages of Gavin reaching it were far higher than me,\" Jones said. \"When he said he wanted it, there were no problems.\" Jones had seen a long-range effort fall a whisker under the crossbar on the hour, before Charlie Hodgson put England in front with 10 minutes left. \"I looked at where it was and I knew I was going to struggle to make it,\" Jones added. \"I said to Gareth (Thomas, the Wales captain) 'This is touch and go.' It was out of my range and obviously Gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance. He was confident and fancied it. \"There were no questions that he'd miss it the way he was playing. He had a superb game.\" Jones was happy to hail Henson's heroic contribution to Wales' first win over England in Cardiff since 1993. \"Physically he's a specimen: he's a balanced player, he glides when he runs and obviously he's got a great kicking game as well,\" Jones said.\n\"His defence was superb, he made some great hits and he had a great game. \"I'm glad he's Welsh.\" Victory over England for the first time since 1999 will no doubt fuel expectations of what Wales might achieve in this year's Six Nations. But they now face three away fixtures in Italy, France and Scotland before completing their campaign against Ireland in Cardiff. \"People all over the world want to see Wales back at the top table of world rugby,\" said a proud coach Mike Ruddock. \"But we are not there yet. The next step is finding the consistency to get further wins. \"We have to travel this week and we can't afford to get too giddy about this result. \"We have got to be professional and keep focused on facing Italy.\"\nNone more so than Henson, who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of Jonny Wilkinson and Brian O'Driscoll. The confident 23-year-old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however. \"I'm the sort of player who likes pressure on me,\" he said. \"It makes me more concentrated and I think I perform better under more pressure. \"I set a high standard against England and I've got to back it up next week. \"Two years ago when we played Italy I wasn't involved and we lost, so we've got to put that right next week.\"",
    "Tony Blair has said voters will have to wait for Labour's manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax.\nThe premier was responding to a challenge from Tory leader Michael Howard who said Labour would raise taxes in its post-election Budget. Mr Blair derided Tory claims they could cut £35bn in \"wasteful spending\" saying the party had got its sums wrong. The two political leaders clashed just days after the opening salvoes of the pre-election period. Mr Howard told MPs that \"every independent expert\" from the International Monetary Fund to the Institute of Fiscal Studies had suggested the \"government was spending more than it is raising and a Labour chancellor would have to put up taxes\". Mr Blair replied: \"I think they are wrong for this very simple reason: that the Treasury forecasts on the economy have been proven right.\" The Tories on Monday highlighted their plans for tax cuts worth £4bn, although the specific taxes to be cut have not been announced.\nThey also spelled out their plans for reduced government borrowing and more spending on key services. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have said the party's sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. But Mr Howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under Labour and Tory value for money and lower taxes. The Liberal Democrats have also launched their pre-election platform, with leader Charles Kennedy saying his party was the \"authentic opposition\", particularly on the Iraq war, council tax and university tuition fees. Labour hit back at the Tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator Alan Milburn accusing Mr Howard of producing a \"fraudulent prospectus\".",
    "Spin the radio dial in the US and you are likely to find plenty of Spanish-language music. But what you will not find is much Spanish-language hip-hop.\nHip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the Spanish-speaking world, but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. But now, a US company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. Los Caballeros de Plan G are one of Mexico's hottest hip-hop acts. They have a devoted fan base in their native Monterrey. But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.\n\"You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible,\" says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. \"It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.\" Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.\nMainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing \"export quality\" rap.\nThe web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its \"infant stage\". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. \"He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,\" Millan says. \"He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world.\" Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. \"Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,\" Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.\nBut one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. \"It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now,\" Millan says. \"And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing.\" Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.",
    "UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered £960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.\nIn a speech, he called for action to reach the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. Mr Brown has just returned from a tour of African nations. The £1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health.\nThe chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK's Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday. Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra £0.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation. That could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. As well as pledging £960m over 15 years to the immunisation IFF, Britain urged other donors to contribute.\nIf Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued. Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. War on Want's John Hilary said: \"Compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. \"As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.\"",
    "Ministers have been asked to explain how Budget details were printed in a London newspaper half an hour before Gordon Brown made his speech.\nThe Tories said a large chunk of the Budget appeared to have been leaked in what they describe as a \"serious breach of Treasury confidentiality\". The Lib Dems called for Commons leader Peter Hain to make a statement and said chancellors had resigned over leaks. They were told it would be brought to Speaker Michael Martin's attention. In the Commons, Tory frontbencher Andrew Tyrie MP demanded an immediate ministerial statement about how measures had been \"clearly, or at least apparently, leaked to the Evening Standard\".\nRaising a point of order, he said it was \"the latest in a long line of discourtesies to this House\", as well as a breach of confidentiality. He said: \"I can only hope it is unintentional. If it were planned it would be a very grave matter indeed. A previous Labour chancellor resigned after he leaked the Budget.\" Hugh Dalton resigned after leaking details of his 1947 budget to journalist John Carvel, who published them in a London newspaper, just minutes before they were announced to the House of Commons. Liberal Democrat David Laws said it was a \"very serious matter\" and said Mr Hain should make a statement on Thursday. Deputy Speaker Sylvia Heal agreed it was \"of concern\" but said nothing could be done immediately but the issue would be brought to Mr Martin's attention.",
    "The world's biggest carmaker General Motors (GM) is recalling nearly 200,000 vehicles in the US on safety grounds, according to federal regulators.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the largest recall involves 155,465 pickups, vans and sports utility vehicles (SUVs). This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said. Those vehicles with potential faults are the Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC Savana, Sierra and Yukon.\nThe NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. GM is also recalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. However, GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. News of the recall follows an announcement last month that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. The world's biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European business, weak US sales and now a product recall. In January, GM said higher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005.",
    "A Conservative MP and former minister has defected to Labour.\nRobert Jackson, 58, MP for Wantage in Oxfordshire, said he was disillusioned with the party's leadership and its \"dangerous\" views on Europe. Prime Minister Tony Blair declared himself \"delighted\", saying Mr Jackson would be warmly welcomed by Labour MPs. Mr Jackson, who has clashed with his leaders over tuition fees and Europe in the past, served as higher education minister between 1987 and 1990. In a letter to his constituency chairman he wrote: \"It is in the country's best interest that Tony Blair rather than Michael Howard should form the next government.\" While saying he admired Mr Blair's \"courageous\" leadership of the country, he bitterly criticised the Conservatives stance on Europe. \"The Conservative Party's hostility to Europe has now hardened to the point at which it advocates the unilateral denunciation of Britain's treaty obligations,\" he wrote.\nMr Blair said Mr Jackson was a \"decent, fair-minded and dedicated public servant... who will be warmly welcome by Labour MPs and members\". \"As he rightly says, [the Conservatives] have learned nothing from their two election defeats and are, if anything, drifting further rightwards,\" he added. A spokesman for Michael Howard said Mr Jackson's views on policy issues were \"very different\" from those of the party leadership. \"He believes students should pay tuition fees, that Tony Blair should not be criticised over his handling of the Iraq war and that more powers should be given to Europe,\" the spokesman said. He added that it was not surprising Mr Jackson had chosen to leave the Conservatives. Mr Jackson is due to stand down at the next election. He is the third Conservative MP to defect to Labour since 1997.",
    "UK house prices dipped slightly in November, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) has said.\nThe average house price fell marginally to £180,226, from £180,444 in October. Recent evidence has suggested that the UK housing market is slowing after interest rate increases, and economists forecast a drop in prices during 2005. But while the monthly figures may hint at a cooling of the market, annual house price inflation is still strong, up 13.8% in the year to November. Economists, however, forecast that ODPM figures are likely to show a weakening in annual house price growth in coming months. \"Overall, the housing market activity is slowing down and that is backed up by the mortgage lending and the mortgage approvals data,\" said Mark Miller, at HBOS Treasury Services. \"The ODPM data is a fairly lagging indicator.\"\nThe figures come after the Bank of England said the number of mortgages approved in the UK has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade. The Halifax, meanwhile, said last week that house prices increased by 1.1% in December - the first monthly rise since September.\nThe UK's biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1% over the whole of 2004, but by only 2.8% in the second half of the year. It is predicting a 2% fall in overall prices in 2005 as the market stabilises after large gains in recent years. The ODPM attributed the monthly fall of prices in November to a drop in the value of detached houses and flats. It said annual inflation rose between October and November because prices had fallen by 1.1% in the same period in 2003.\nThe ODPM data showed the average house price was £192,713 in England; £139,544 in Wales; £116,542 in Scotland, and £111,314 in Northern Ireland.\nAll areas saw a rise in annual house price inflation in November except for Northern Ireland and the West Midlands, where the rate was unchanged, the ODPM said. The North East showed the highest rate of inflation at 26.2%, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber on 21.7%, and the North West on 21.1%. The East Midlands, the West Midlands and the South West all had an annual inflation rate of more than 15%. In London, the area with the highest average house price at £262,825, annual inflation rose only slightly in November to 7.1% from 7% the previous month.",
    "James McIlroy stormed to his second international victory in less than a week, claiming the men's 800m at the TEAG indoor meeting in Erfurt.\nThe Northern Ireland runner set a new personal best of one minute, 46.68 seconds - a time good enough to qualify for the European Indoor Championships. \"I'm qualified now and that's what matters most,\" said the 28-year-old. McIlroy is now hoping to gain a late entry into Sunday's international indoor meeting in Leipzig. The Northern Irishman is hoping manager Ricky Simms can swing it for him to compete after he initially withdrew after contracting a cold. After three successive wins over the past fortnight, McIlroy is brimming with confidence. \"I've been waiting over six years for this to happen and now I'm certain my career has turned the corner.\" On Friday, McIlroy delivered an impressive run despite suffering from his bad cold. The AAA indoor and outdoor champion accelerated away from the field in the final 300m, beating German Wolfram Mulle by 0.90 seconds. McIlroy set a world-leading mark for 1,000m at the Sparkassen Cup in Stuttgart last weekend. And his time in Erfurt makes him third fastest over 800m in the world this year.",

Also capitalising on Brits success were the Scissor Sisters whose eponymous album moved three places to number two. U2's latest single Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own took the top spot in the singles chart, ahead of Elvis. The track, from their current album How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, pushed Eminem's Like Toy Soldiers from number one to number three.\nElvis' Wooden Heart, which entered the chart at number two, is the sixth in a series of 18 reissues to mark the 70th anniversary of Presley's birth.

    "The stage adaptation of children's film Mary Poppins has had its opening night in London's West End.\nSir Cameron Mackintosh's lavish production, which has cost £9m to bring to the stage, was given a 10-minute standing ovation. Lead actress Laura Michelle Kelly soared over the heads of the audience holding the nanny's trademark umbrella. Technical hitches had prevented Mary Poppins' flight into the auditorium during preview performances. A number of celebrities turned out for the musical's premiere, including actress Barbara Windsor, comic Graham Norton and Sir Richard Attenborough.\nThe show's director Richard Eyre issued a warning earlier in the week that the show was unsuitable for children under seven, while under-threes are barred. Mary Poppins was originally created by author Pamela Travers, who is said to have cried when she saw Disney's 1964 film starring Julie Andrews. Travers had intended the story to be a lot darker than the perennial family favourite.

He made his comments at the start of a day of appearances on Channel Five in a session on The Wright Stuff programme. Questions from callers, a studio audience and the show's presenter covered Lib Dem tax plans, anti-terror laws and immigration.\nMr Kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in Parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of British politics. \"1983 was when I was first elected as an MP - so Tony Blair, Michael Howard and myself were all class of '83 - and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition,\" he said. \"We don't actually hear the argument any longer: 'Lib Dems, good people, reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here - it's a wasted vote'. \"You don't hear that because the evidence of people's senses demonstrates that it isn't a wasted vote.\" But he said Mr Blair had lost the trust of the British people. \"There is a fundamental lack of trust in Tony Blair as prime minister and in his government,\" he said.\n\"What we've got to do as a party - what I've got to do as a leader of this party - is to convey to people that what you see is what you get.\" Mr Kennedy also used his TV appearance to defend his party's plans to increase income tax to 50% for those earning more than £100,000, saying it would apply to just 1% of the population. He said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top-up fees, introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax.

The legal action accuses Mr Spector of murdering the actress at his LA home. Mr Spector is currently free on $1m (£535,000) bail and is awaiting trial. The 64-year-old has denied the killing, saying her death was accidental.\nMs Clarkson's legal action, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, also accuses Mr Spector of negligence and battery, alleging he \"grabbed, hit, fought with and restrained\" Lana Clarkson before shooting her to death. Her lawyers said in a statement: \"The Clarkson family had hoped that there would be some resolution with regard to the criminal proceedings before moving forward with the civil action. \"However, Ms Clarkson and her family understand that the fair administration of justice takes time and in light of the numerous changes Mr Spector has made in his legal defence team over the last two years, Ms Clarkson was forced to file the action before (the statute of limitations expired) on 3 February 2005.\" Mr Spector, known for his work with the Beatles, has claimed that Lana Clarkson committed suicide. His lawyers, led by Bruce Cutler, have vowed to prove him innocent at trial.\nMr Cutler said: \"Phil did not cause the death of this woman, he's not criminally responsible and he's not civilly responsible either. \"But I'm not surprised they filed a suit for money, that seems to be de rigueur nowadays.\" A Los Angeles Superior Court judge is expected to set a trial date later this month for Spector, who was indicted on murder charges in September.

Quirky comedy Sideways was named best screenplay and best comedy. Ray star Jamie Foxx was best actor in a musical/comedy while Briton Clive Owen and Natalie Portman won prizes for best supporting roles in Closer.\nThe Aviator, in which DiCaprio plays millionaire Howard Hughes, edged ahead of its rivals at the Beverly Hills ceremony by winning the best original score prize. This give it a total of three awards while Million Dollar Baby, Sideways and Closer took two Golden Globes each. Accepting his best dramatic actor prize, DiCaprio described director Martin Scorsese as \"one of the greatest contributors to the world of cinema of all time\".\nAnnette Bening won best actress in a musical/comedy for Being Julia while Spanish movie The Sea Inside was named best foreign language film. Swank, who previously won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Boys Don't Cry, paid tribute to Million Dollar Baby director and co-star Clint Eastwood. \"You guided us so brilliantly, while you also, in my humble opinion, gave the performance of your career,\" she said. Foxx was nominated for three awards but was beaten to the best supporting actor title by Owen and the best actor in a TV movie prize by Geoffrey Rush in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers.\nA BBC co-production, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers was also named best TV movie.

Unlike the Oscars, the Golden Globes split awards by genre - one prize for dramas and the other for musicals and comedies. The Globes also honour the best in television, with suburban series Desperate Housewives named best TV comedy show.

    "Computer firm Apple has issued a lawsuit to prevent online leaks of information about future products.\nThe lawsuit, against an unidentified individual, comes just weeks before the MacWorld conference in San Francisco, used to showcase new products. The complaint said an \"unidentified individual... has recently misappropriated and disseminated confidential information\". The lawsuit was filed with the Santa Clara California Superior Court. Apple is famously secretive about its future product launches while Apple users are equally famous for speculating about new technology from the company. Fans have speculated in recent weeks about the possibility of a new type of iPod being announced at the MacWorld conference.\nApple said in the seven-page complaint, filed on 13 December, that it did not know the \"true names or capacities, whether individual, associate, corporate or otherwise,\" of the defendants. The company said it would amend the complaint once they had discovered the names of those who had allegedly leaked information. It is not the first time Apple has sued people who have posted information about future products on the internet. In December 2002, Apple sued a former contractor who allegedly posted online drawings, images and engineering details of the company's PowerMac G4 computer. In a statement, Apple said of the current lawsuit: \"Apple has filed a civil complaint against unnamed individuals who we believe stole our trade secrets and posted detailed information about an unannounced Apple product on the internet.\"",
    "Oil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three-month lows after news that US crude stocks have improved ahead of winter.\nLondon Brent crude closed at $40.15 on Thursday - a drop of 5.1% - having dived below $40 a barrel for the first time since mid-September. US light crude traded in New York lost more than $2 to $43.25, its lowest close since 10 September. The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days. The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices. \"It's amazing how quickly sentiment changed,\" said Rick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis. Analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil.\nThe stronger fuel inventories helped boost US stock markets to nine-month highs on Wednesday, though only the Nasdaq index had hung onto those gains by the end of Thursday.\nIn London, the FTSE 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. However, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.\nThe price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October. Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September. Traders were also encouraged by comments on Wednesday from the energy minister of Opec member Algeria. Chakib Khelil said the cartel was likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week. However, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec's attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output.\nFears still remain over the level of US heating oil stocks, which are rising but remain down on 2004 levels. A cold spell in north America would start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises. Analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise. \"Mother Nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks,\" said Kyle Cooper, at Citigroup Global Markets. \"Long term I think we're headed to $30-35 but I don't think we're doing that yet. We have a lot of winter left.\" John Person, president of National Futures Advisory Services, said the EIA data indicated there should be adequate supplies for the next three months in the US. .",
    "Chancellor Gordon Brown's closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a Budget giveaway on 16 March.\nEd Balls, ex-chief economic adviser to the Treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day. But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.\nMr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - \"with a margin to spare\". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.\nHe also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he told a Parliamentary lunch. \"This is a big change in our political culture.\"\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown's Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. \"I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,\" he said.\nHis assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. His message to the chancellor was: \"Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering.\" Sir Digby added: \"I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. \"We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'. \"That would be a good way to spend any excess.\"\nMr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. \"I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,\" Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.",
    "Gordon Brown has failed to tackle the \"fundamental unfairness\" in the tax system in his ninth Budget, Charles Kennedy has said.\nHow was it right that the poorest 20% of society were still paying more as a proportion of their income than the richest 20%, the Lib Dem leader asked. The new £200 council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the \"unfair tax\", he added. The government could not go on \"patching up\" the system, he added. Speaking in the Commons after Mr Brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last Budget before the general election, Mr Kennedy acknowledged that the UK was one of the most successful economies in the world.\nBut he criticised both the chancellor and the Tories for failing to address the \"ticking bomb\" of council tax revaluation. He said the recent experience of Wales indicated seven million households in England would pay significantly more after revaluation. The chancellor's announcement that he was to offer a £200 council tax rebate paid by pensioner households was merely a \"sticking plaster\" to a much bigger problem. The Lib Dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than £450 a year, with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off.\nOn pensions, Mr Kennedy said it was a \"scandal\" that the system discriminated against women who had missed making National Insurance payments when they were having children. He said a residency criteria would end \"at a stroke this fundamental iniquity\". Mr Kennedy added his party's priorities of free long-term care for the elderly, abolishing top-up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging 50% income tax to those earning more than £100,000 per annum. He contrasted his approach with Mr Brown's pledge in 2001 not to increase income tax. The chancellor went on to put up National Insurance contributions after the election. \"For most individuals, most families, most households, it adds up to exactly the same thing,\" said Mr Kennedy. \"And they wonder why people get cynical about their politicians when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election.\"",
    "David Blunkett has spoken of his love for married publisher Kimberly Quinn for the first time.\nThe home secretary described how it affected his friends and personal life, but said he was a great believer in personal responsibility. Mr Blunkett is taking legal action to gain access to Mrs Quinn's two-year-old son. She denies he is Mr Blunkett's. The interview with BBC Radio Sheffield was made before allegations he fast-tracked a visa for Mrs Quinn's nanny. The allegations, which he has denied, are being investigated by Sir Alan Budd. Mr Blunkett talked about how he fell in love - but that she resisted his desire to go public.\nIn an apparent reference to his court action to gain access to her son, he says he was a great believer in responsibility and consequences, even when they were painful. Mr Blunkett told BBC Radio Sheffield: \"I fell in love with someone and they wouldn't go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer, and then the News of the World picked up the story. \"I tried for three years to make something work. \"I haven't spoken about it and I don't intend to. Even in the biography that's being written about me I've ensured that there's as little as possible.\" BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said the timing of the broadcast was unlikely to help his efforts to show that he is concentrating on getting on with the job of home secretary. Shadow home secretary David Davis says Mr Blunkett should quit if he is found to have influenced the visa process even indirectly.\nReports have claimed Mr Blunkett chaired a meeting to discuss delays in the visa system after he learned of nanny Leoncia Casalme's wait. The Home Office has said it would be up to Sir Alan's inquiry to decide if any such meeting was relevant. Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart said she hoped Mr Blunkett would survive in his job. \"I work with him every day and I have always been surprised by how focused he is on the job in hand, on working to deal with things,\" she said. She told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme: \"He is just really down for the job and I hope he does (survive).\"",
    "Older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study.\nThe number of women buying programs to protect PCs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. The study, for net security firm Preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. It is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. For the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. But more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. The research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers.\nThe study predicts that 40% of all home PC net security buyers will be women in 2005. They could even overtake men as the main buyers by 2007, if current rates persist, according to the research. \"I think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their PCs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong\", said one over-60 woman who took part in the research.\n\"You started off with young male stereotype computer users for last 10 years,\" Paul Goosens, head of Preventon told the BBC News website. \"Now we are seeing real people - both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home.\" But net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online, particuarly if they are new to broadband, he said.\nPrograms also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dial-up users with a slower connection too, said Mr Goosens. Security software should be easy to use, with simple interfaces and instructions written in non-technical language, he added. The nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about e-mail viruses. High-profile complaints about rogue diallers, and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers, have also raised awareness about the need to have a combination of anti-virus, firewall and spyware-removal programs too. Without protection, these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally.\nMore than 30,000 PCs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses, a study from security from Symantec showed last year. Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer, according to net security experts. Programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs, many based in Eastern Europe, over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance. The research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because, said Mr Goosens, they are reported in the press much more. \"You are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat. They are asking the right questions,\" he explained. \"It is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using a reputable service provider, that they are safe to connect to the net.\" An unprotected computer on a broadband connection can be breached and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes. By the end of the year it is thought that more than 30% of UK homes will have broadband net access. In July last year, the number of UK households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time, according to the Office of National Statistics.",
    "The Mac mini has been welcomed by Apple fans, industry experts and PC users.\nThe release of the tiny, low-cost machine is seen as a good move for Apple which currently has a small share of the desktop computer market. Mac watchers and some analysts say the Mac mini will go a long way to help Apple appeal to the mass of consumers. They speculate that the Mac mini will be bought by iPod owners and those wanting an easy-to-use and administer second home computer.\n\"It's the bravest move they have made yet,\" said Jonny Evans, news editor at Macworld magazine. Mr Evans said the combination of low cost, small size and huge numbers of iPod users could make it a big success.\nHe thought that the machine would appeal to those that like Apple technology but who before now have balked at paying high prices for its hardware. \"It's deeply affordable,\" he said. \"Plus you know that you do not get viruses or all of the associated problems.\" Already, he said, PC owning friends had declared that they would be buying one. Interest in the new products launched at Macworld expo was so strong that websites for Apple's store and the show struggled to cope with demand. According to response statistics gathered by Netcraft many visiting the Apple store in the wake of Mr Jobs' speech suffered lengthy response times. The Macworld Expo site was completely overwhelmed and went offline.\n\"I think fundamentally it's a good idea because it's cheap even for a PC,\" said Nick Ross, deputy labs editor at PC Pro. Apple's work on making things easy to use would also help the Mac mini win fans, he said. \"I think people expect it just to work now and really it should,\" hesaid. The Mac mini could find a role in homes that need a second computer that is easy to install and administer, he said. \"For browsing the web, e-mail and all kinds of basic duties it's going to be absolutely adequate,\" said Mr Ross. Ian Fogg, broadband and personal technology analyst at Jupiter Research, agreed that the Mac mini could be very popular. \"Apple has been hoping that sales of the iPod will have a halo effect on the sales of the Mac,\" he said.\nBefore now, he said, Apple has been seen as a premium brand. But, he said, the Mac mini changed that perception. \"It's a particularly good price when you see that it's Apple that is doing it,\" he said. Apple expects the Mac mini to sell for £339 in the UK and $499 in the US. Adding extras such as a larger hard drive, more memory and networking options will increase the basic price. It will go on sale from 22 January. \"For consumers interested in style, design and small size - which is what the majority of iPod customers are interested in - it's a natural next step,\" said Mr Fogg. Apple has traditionally done well in the market that the Mac mini is aimed at, said Mr Fogg, who also expected many PC makers to release copycat devices in reaction.\nHis only misgivings were over how easy other consumers, other than iPod owners, would find using the machine. He said anyone wanting to use the Mac mini with the peripherals from an old computer may find it odd to have something so small and sleek next to a hulking monitor. \"They'd be much more likely to pair a Mac mini with a LCD or flat panel monitor which increases the upgrade cost,\" he said. Those with flat screens and LCD monitors are likely to have bought them recently and not be in the market for a new machine.\nThere are also questions over whether the Mac mini will work with very old peripherals, such as display, keyboard and mouse. The Mac mini also fell short of being a media server that can be a video recorder as well as a store for all the digital music, movies and images people accumulate, said Mr Fogg. \"The Mac mini is not quite ready for that yet,\" he said. \"It does not have the right connectors that fit a TV screen or enough storage.\" Said Mr Fogg: \"It's very much a computer.\" One dissenting opinion came from Brian Gammage, vice-president of research at analysts Gartner. He said: \"I don't think it changes the world.\" Although the Mac mini was very cheap for an Apple computer, it was still expensive compared to many PCs. Also, he said, it appealed in categories that few consumers care about when buying a home computer. \"The PC world is a pile-em-high, sell-em-cheap market,\" he said, \"and all of them are pretty interchangeable.\" \"Since the days when Apple ruled the personal computing world its market share has been on a long, slow decline,\" he said. \"Every few years it does something to give its market share a kick then it starts to go back down again,\" said Mr Gammage. The release of the Mac mini fit perfectly with this trend, he said.",
    "The United States kept the Davis Cup final alive with victory in Saturday's doubles rubber, leaving Spain 2-1 ahead going into the final day.\nMasters Cup champions Mike and Bob Bryan thrashed Juan Carlos Ferrero and Tommy Robredo 6-0 6-3 6-2 in front of a partisan crowd in Seville. Victory would have given Spain the title but they were outclassed. In Sunday's reverse singles, Carlos Moya takes on Andy Roddick before Rafael Nadal faces Mardy Fish. \"It feels good, but it's not going to be as good if we don't win two tomorrow,\" said Mike Bryan. \"It feels good to give those guys another shot, and Spain has to go to sleep on that.\" Bob Bryan added: \"I'm really confident in Andy winning that first match, and then anything can happen.\" Spain coach Jordi Arrese chose to rest 18-year-old Nadal in the doubles after his epic singles win over Roddick on Friday. He was replaced by former world number one Ferrero, but the Spanish pair were out of their depth against one of the world's best doubles teams.\nThe 26-year-old Bryan twins have won all four of their Davis Cup matches this year. And they quickly silenced the huge crowd at the Olympic Stadium, racing through the opening set to love. The Spaniards then twice surrendered breaks of serve at the start of the second before the Bryans broke to go 5-3 ahead and served out. When Robredo dropped serve in the opening game of the third set the match was all but over, and the unflappable Bryan brothers powered on to an impressive win. Ferrero, who was upset to be dropped for Friday's singles, hinted at further dissatisfaction after the defeat. \"It was a difficult game against the best doubles players,\" he said. \"They have everything calculated and we had very little to do. \"I was a bit surprised that I was named to play the doubles match because I hardly play doubles.\" Arrese said: \"Juan Carlos hasn't played at all badly. He played the right way but the Bryans are great doubles players.\"",
    "UK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report.\nOptimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at BDO Stoy Hayward. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May. The BDO optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.\nThe only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said. Its BDO's output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. However, the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterling's strength against the dollar and high oil prices, the group noted. Its inflation index, which has risen continuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in January from 108.0 in October last year. \"The UK is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,\" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. \"Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services.\"",
    "Householders who injure or even kill intruders are unlikely to be prosecuted - providing they were acting \"honestly and instinctively\", new guidelines say.\nThe law also protects those who use \"something to hand\" as a weapon. The leaflet, published by police and prosecutors, aims to combat confusion about current legislation, which lets people use \"reasonable force\". The guidance, relating to England and Wales, follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law. Doing what you \"honestly and instinctively\" believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully, the guidance said.\nAnd the law protects those who use \"something to hand\" as a weapon, said the leaflet published jointly by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).\nAs a general rule, the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt, the more force can be used lawfully in self-defence, it said, adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves. But knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further, or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of \"excessive and gratuitous\" force. The Tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use \"grossly disproportionate\" force. Their demands have been backed by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens. Tory frontbencher Patrick Mercer is now pursuing the proposal through a private member's bill in Parliament.\nThe government instead mounted a publicity campaign to clear up public uncertainty after a review concluded no law change was necessary. Home Secretary Charles Clarke said: \"I believe in that old adage 'an Englishman's home is his castle'. That's exactly what should be the case and I believe the current law provides that.\" An \"informal trawl\" of CPS records found 11 people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past 15 years, five of whom were convicted. They included a man who laid in wait for a burglar on commercial premises in Cheshire, before beating him up, throwing him into a pit and setting him on fire.\nA CPS spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder. In one of Britain's highest profile cases, Norfolk farmer Tony Martin was jailed for life for murdering 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras, in 1999. The conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal and the sentence cut to five years. Mr Martin was freed from prison in July 2003. The guidance published on Tuesday, said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury. In cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were \"determined\" they would be dealt with \"as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible\", it said.",
    "The release of a film about the Mumbai (Bombay) blasts in 1993 has been postponed following protests by those on trial for the bombings.\nInvestigating the blasts which killed more than 250 people and wounded 1,000, the film Black Friday had been due to open across India on Friday. But 36 people accused in connection with the blasts said it should not be screened until the trial is over. Mumbai High Court postponed the film's launch until 3 February.\nBlack Friday is based upon the novel of the same name written by journalist S Hussain Zaidi, which looks at the 15 explosions which rocked Mumbai on 12 March 1993. Director Anurag Kashyap said the film's release should not be delayed as the book has already been on sale for two years. \"If you have not gone against the book, then how can you go against the movie?\" Mr Kashyap's lawyer Mihir Desai said. This is the second time that those accused in connection with the blasts have sought legal intervention regarding the film.\nThey previously asked that a line from the movie's poster, which claimed the film portrayed \"the true story of the Bombay bomb blasts\", be removed. Their lawyer, Majeed Memon, said: \"We had argued that how can a film say it is telling the true story when the court itself is struggling to find the truth? \"So we said they should remove the line from their promotional posters and they did give us an assurance that they would do so.\" The Mumbai bombings case is one of India's longest-running trials. A special court was set up to hear the case and regular hearings have taken place there for the last nine years, with more than six hundred witnesses questioned.",
    "News Corporation is seeking to buy out minority investors in Fox Entertainment Group, its broadcasting subsidiary, for about $5.4bn (£3.7bn).\nThe media giant, run by Rupert Murdoch, owns 82% of the shares in the company, home to the Fox television network and the 20th Century Fox film studio. The move follows News Corp's decision to register its business in the US. 20th Century Fox's recent film releases include I Heart Huckabees and I, Robot, while Fox puts out hit TV series 24.\nUnder the terms of the offer, minority Fox shareholders will receive 1.90 News Corp shares in return for each Fox share they hold. Analysts said the decision to list News Corp in the US - which will result in the firm's shares trading in New York rather than Sydney- nullified the need to retain a separate stock market listing for Fox Entertainment shares. News Corp investors voted in October to approve the transfer of the company's corporate domicile from Australia to the US state of Delaware. The move is designed to help News Corp attract more investment from the largest US financial institutions, and make it easier to raise capital. Fox Entertainment Group generated revenues of $12bn last year. News Corp shares fell 25 cents to $17.65 after the share offer was announced while Fox shares were up 19 cents at $31.22.",
    "Standard Life, Europe's largest mutual life insurer, has cut bonuses for with-profit policyholders.\nAnnual bonus rates on its with-profits life policies were cut from 2.5% to 2%, while bonuses on pension policies were reduced from 3.25% to 2.5%. It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004. The insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates.\nWith-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. Profits made in good years are kept in reserve to pay investors an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly. Slumping share prices throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. Standard Life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002. The insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered. Recently, Norwich Union and Axa Sun Life both cut their with-profit bonus rates.\nJohn Gill, managing director of the insurer's life and pensions division, said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only \"partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002\". In addition, low interest rates meant that \"long-term investment returns are well below historic levels\", Mr Gill added. However, Mr Gill maintained that with-profits continued to perform well over the long term. \"Our payouts continue to stand up well against other types of long-term investments over similar periods,\" he said. Standard Life has an estimated 2.4 million with-profits policyholders. Last year, the company announced that it was looking to float on the stock market in 2006.",
    "The Conservatives have expressed \"serious misgivings\" about government plans for keeping UK and foreign terror suspects under house arrest.\nMichael Howard said he would not back the Home Secretary's plans for \"control orders\" which include home detention. \"I do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician,\" he said. The Lib Dems also oppose the proposals, but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat.\nThe government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws. New Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair has backed the control orders, saying: \"I'm sorry. It is a dilemma, but there is only one choice.\" But Mr Howard said: \"We have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the British way of life.\"\nHe argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison - not at home - while they await trial. Mr Howard said he feared \"internment without trial creates martyrs\" and could be \"a very effective recruiting sergeant\" for terrorists\". His party plans to move an amendment to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court. He called on the prime minister to \"enter into constructive discussions\" with his party to find a \"better way forward\". Controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the UK without trial or charge since December 2001 was freed from jail.\nHome Secretary Charles Clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the Egyptian man, known only as C, certified as a terrorist suspect. On Monday, the legal team for two Algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest. Most of the terror suspects are detained at Belmarsh Prison in London. The Liberal Democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure. Home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's a matter of principle for us that we can't have a situation where the Home Secretary is able to impose house detention now on UK nationals as well as foreign nationals.\"\nThe Lib Dems believe the Home Secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions. \"We think there could be a role for some form of control order - tagging, surveillance, limitation on use of mobile phones - but not with the Home Secretary's say so. That must be done with a proper judicial process, a judge involved in making those decisions,\" said Mr Oaten. Mr Clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk. He said prosecutions were the government's first preference and promised the powers would only be used in \"serious\" cases, with independent scrutiny from judges.",
    "US rap duo OutKast's trio of trophies at the MTV Europe Awards crowns a year of huge success for the band.\nThe latest triumph adds to the three Grammys and four American MTV gongs won earlier in this year. Andre 3000 and Big Boi's album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below has been critically acclaimed since its release and sold in large quantities around the world. The double album - which saw the pair produce one disc each - topped the charts in the US at the same time as single Hey Ya! It took another track from the exponents of southern hip-hop - The Way You Move - to displace it from the top spot. The Georgia pair's year of critical and commercial triumph leaves them with a tough act to follow - what can be next for a musical act that has done it all?\nG Money, a presenter on the BBC's urban music station 1Xtra, thinks a hiatus is inevitable after such a sustained period of exposure - giving the band time to think about other interests. \"They might be more appearances outside the band, such as producing for other artists, while they have a number of fringe music projects. \"Andre 3000 would like to go into acting, so we might see him a film, while Big Boi already has a dog-breeding business,\" says the DJ.\n\"But in a couple of years they will be back with another album which will be a collaboration unlike their double CD. \"Their greatness has become clear with Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. We haven't seen the last of them,\" he adds. OutKast's musical career spans 10 years and they have enjoyed commercial and critical success in the past, with their debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik going platinum. But it took until 2001 for the pair to score their first hit in the UK with Ms Jackson, while their album Stakonia saw their fame spread beyond the US.\n1Xtra's G Money says it took the latest album, released in 2003, for him to be \"assured of their genius\". \"They have always been experimental, some of it has worked and some hasn't,\" he adds. But G Money acknowledges that making the next move for a band that has reached a pinnacle can be tough. \"What can you do next when you've done it all?\" he says.

    "World 5000m champion Eliud Kipchoge won the 9.2km race at the View From Great Edinburgh Cross Country.\nThe Kenyan, who was second when Newcastle hosted the race last year, was in front from the outset. Ethiopian duo Gebre Gebremariam and Dejene Berhanu made last-gasp efforts to overtake him, but Kipchoge responded and a burst of speed clinched victory. Gavin Thompson was the first Briton in 12th place while Nick McCormick held of his British rivals to win the 4km race. The Morpeth Harrier led from the end of the first lap and ended Mike Skinner and Andrew Baddeley's hopes with a surge in the lasp lap. \"My training has gone so well I wasn't really worried about the opposition asI knew I was in great shape,\" said McCormick, who now hopes to earn a 1,500m place in the British team for the World Championships in Helsinki. In the women's race, Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba won a battle with world cross country champion Benita Johnson to retain her title. Australian Johnson, who shocked her African rivals in Brussels last March, looked to be on course for another win in the 6.2km race. But world 5000m champion Dibaba make a telling strike for the finishing line in the final 20 metres. Britons Kathy Butler and Hayley Yelling were out of contention early on.",
    "The Brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country's biggest airline.\nBrazil's airport authority chief Carlos Wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save Varig, Brazil's flagship airline. However, the country's vice president Jose Alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution. Varig is struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of 6.5 billion reais ($2.3bn or £1.2bn). Asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting of the country's Congress to discuss the airline's crisis, Mr Alencar replied: \"No, I don't think so. We will see.\"\nEarlier, Mr Wilson had said that president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week. \"In practice, it will be an intervention, although this is not the technical name used\", he said. An intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances. For that to happen Varig's main shareholder, the non-profit Ruben Berta Foundation which represents the airline's employees, would have to be removed, Mr Wilson said. However, no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying, he added. Varig, which operates in 18 countries apart from Brazil, has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country's economic downturn.\nThe depreciation of Brazil's currency has had a direct impact on the airline's dollar debt as well as some of its costs. Business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the Brazilian economy. The airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government. On Tuesday the courts awarded Varig 2bn reais ($725m), after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992. But the government can appeal the decision.",
    "Andy Roddick will play Cyril Saulnier in the final of the SAP Open in San Jose on Sunday.\nThe American top seed and defending champion overcame Germany's Tommy Haas, the third seed, 7-6 (7-3) 6-3. And Saulnier survived an injury scare in his semi-final with seventh-seeded Austrian Jurgen Melzer. The Frenchman twisted his ankle early in the second set but overcame Melzer, who was left fuming over a series of line calls, 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-3. \"I was feeling horrible earlier in the week,\" Roddick said. \"I thought tonight was another step in the right direction. \"On my returns, I was standing in more and I'm getting a little more depth, even if I don't hit a perfect return.\"\nRoddick won the last four points of the first-set tie-break before being broken at the start of the second set. But he broke straight back and then broke Haas again to lead 4-2. \"It's extremely frustrating when you have chances against a top-five player and don't do anything with them,\" admitted Haas. \"I rushed a few backhands and he took advantage.\" Saulnier will move into the world's top 50 for the first time after his passage through to the final. \"It's taken a lot of work and a lot of fighting in my mind,\" he revealed. \"Sometimes I didn't believe I could get to a final and now I am here. I've stayed mentally strong. \"I'm on the way. I'll keep fighting and work a lot and I'll be up there.\"",
    "UK interest rates are set to remain on hold at 4.75% following the latest meeting of the Bank of England.\nThe Bank's rate-setting committee has put up rates five times in the past year but rates have been on hold since September amid signs of a slowdown. Economic growth slowed in the previous quarter, as manufacturing output fell, while consumer confidence has slipped. There is also growing evidence that the previously booming UK housing market is now cooling.\nHouse prices fell 0.4% in October, according to the Nationwide, their biggest monthly fall since February 2001. Last month, Bank of England governor Mervyn King said that the economy had hit a \"softer patch\" after rapid economic growth in the first half of 2004. Richard Jeffrey, chief economist at Bridgewell Securities, said it was very unlikely that the Bank of England would put rates up again this time around. \"There have been sufficient signs in the economy of a slowdown to stay the Bank of England's hand,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. However, Mr Jeffrey said he believed the slowdown in economic activity was temporary and it was dangerous to assume that rates had peaked. \"I still think interest rates are going up,\" he said. \"We are not out of the woods.\"",
    "Car-maker Honda's humanoid robot Asimo has just got faster and smarter.\nThe Japanese firm is a leader in developing two-legged robots and the new, improved Asimo (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility) can now run, find his way around obstacles as well as interact with people. Eventually Asimo could find gainful employment in homes and offices. \"The aim is to develop a robot that can help people in their daily lives,\" said a Honda spokesman.\nTo get the robot running for the first time was not an easy process as it involved Asimo making an accurate leap and absorbing the impact of landing without slipping or spinning. The \"run\" he is now capable of is perhaps not quite up to Olympic star Kelly Holmes' standard. At 3km/h, it is closer to a leisurely jog. Its makers claim that it is almost four times as fast as Sony's Qrio, which became the first robot to run last year. The criteria for running robots is defined by engineers as having both feet off the ground between strides. Asimo has improved in other ways too, increasing his walking speed, from 1.6km/h to 2.5km, growing 10cm to 130cm and putting on 2kg in weight. While he may not quite be ready for yoga, he does have more freedom of movement, being able to twist his hips and bend his wrists, thumbs and neck.\nAsimo has already made his mark on the international robot scene and in November was inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame. He has wowed audiences around the world with his ability to walk upstairs, recognise faces and come when beckoned. In August 2003 he even attended a state dinner in the Czech Republic, travelling with the Japanese prime minister as a goodwill envoy. He is one of a handful of robots used by tech firms to trumpet their technological advances. Technology developed for Asimo could be used in the automobile industry as electronics increasingly take over from mechanics in car design. For the moment Asimo's biggest role is an entertainer and the audience gathered to see his first public run greeted his slightly comical gait with amusement, according to reports. Robots can fulfil serious functions in society and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe predicts that the worldwide market for industrial robots will swell from 81,000 units in 2003 to 106,000 in 2007.",
    "The dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the US economy.\nThe greenback hit $1.3516 in thin New York trade, before rallying to $1.3509. The dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded about $1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the US trade and budget deficits. Meanwhile, France's finance minister has said the world faced \"economic catastrophe\" unless the US worked with Europe and Asia on currency controls. Herve Gaymard said he would seek action on the issue at the next meeting of G7 countries in February. Ministers from European and Asian governments have recently called on the US to strengthen the dollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies. \"It's absolutely essential that at the meeting of the G7 our American friends understand that we need coordinated management at the world level,\" said Mr Gaymard.\nThursday's new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the US had fallen 12% in November - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity.\nCommerce Department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the US economy - grew just 0.2% last month. The figure was weaker than forecast - and fell short of the 0.8% rise in October. The official US policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters.\nThe US government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from \"abnormal and dangerous heights\" set in 2002. The US says it will let market forces determine the dollar's strength rather than intervene directly. Statements from President Bush in recent weeks highlighting his aim to cut the twin US deficits have prompted slight upturns in the currency. But while some observers said the quiet trade on Thursday had exacerbated small moves in the market, most agree the underlying trend remains downwards. The dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further, albeit less dramatic weakening, in 2005. \"I can see it finishing the year around $1.35 and we can see that it's going to be a steady track upward for the euro/dollar in 2005, finishing the year around $1.40,\" said Adrian Hughes, currency strategist with HSBC in London.",
    "Chancellor Gordon Brown has been given a £2.1bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule, which allows him to borrow only for investment.\nThe extra leeway came after the Office for National Statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years. It comes just weeks ahead of the Budget and an expected general election. Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: \"At best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government.\"\nA review by the ONS found it had made a mistake by \"double counting\" some spending on roads since 1998/9. Correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment, thus helping Mr Brown to meet his \"golden rule\" of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle. Economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the Budget.\nThe changes by the ONS increase the current budget measure for the past five years by £2.1bn in total. Mr Letwin said: \"This is a very murky area... There will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled.\" The Conservatives also said Mr Brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual £10.5bn \"black hole\" in the nation's coffers. But the Treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions.\nIn January the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Mr Brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year's Budget. It also said the government might narrowly miss its \"golden rule\" if the current economic cycle ended in 2005/06. After the ONS announcement, economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about £400m. \"None of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years,\" said Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. \"Accordingly, it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course.\"",
    "Has there been a better Six Nations match than Saturday's epic in Paris?\nAnd can the Welsh revival continue all the way to a first Grand Slam since 1978? Those are the two questions occupying not just Wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in Paris. Welsh legend Mervyn Davies, a member of two of three Grand Slam-winning sides of the 1970s, hailed it as \"one of the great performances of the past three decades\". Martyn Williams, Wales' two-try scorer on the day, called it \"one of the most surreal games I have ever played in\". A crestfallen France coach, Bernard Laporte, simply observed: \"There was a French half and there was a Welsh half\". And what a half it was for the Red Dragonhood, transforming a 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period. But while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure, the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this Welsh side. That they recovered from a battering in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time, then reverse it on the resumption, was remarkable enough. But in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of French pressure in a nail-biting final five minutes, Wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve.\nIn international rugby, any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day, but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis. England suffered some infamous Six Nations disappointments en route to World Cup glory, the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered. Wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light. But the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline. Ten of the 22 on duty on Saturday were also involved when Wales were trounced 33-5 in Paris two years ago. But since they threw off the shackles against New Zealand in the 2003 World Cup, Wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place.\n\"The confidence in the squad has been building and building since the World Cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class,\" noted coach Mike Ruddock. The likes of Michael Owen, Gethin Jenkins, Dwayne Peel and Gavin Henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer's Lions tour to New Zealand. And players like Stephen Jones, Martyn Williams, Shane Williams and Gareth Thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve. Jones, after his superb man-of-the-match display, observed that \"we are a very happy camp now\". Ruddock and Thomas can take much of the credit for that, ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred Welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad. The\njoie de vivre\nso evident in that magical second-half spell in Paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s.\nIf England had half the innate attacking exuberance Wales have produced in this championship, they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats. Similarly, Wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches, and that forward power, mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure are equally important. So on to Murrayfield, where Wales have not won on their last three visits. While the hype in the Principality will go into overdrive, the players will set about the task of beating Scotland. Only then - with the visit of Ireland to finish - can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s, and writing their own names into Welsh legend.",
    "A TV station in the US has refused to show a controversial new series where adopted children try and pick their birth father - and win a cash prize.\nThe WRAZ-TV Fox affiliate in North Carolina was the only one of 182 stations to refuse Monday's show. Who's Your Daddy promises $100,000 (£52,000) to the contestant if she correctly identifies her father. It was met with protests by the National Council for Adoption, which said it \"exploits\" sensitive emotions. \"It exploits the sensitive emotions of adoption,\" said Thomas Atwood, president of the National Council for Adoption. \"It trivialises them. Adoption is a very personal, meaningful experience and it should not be commercialised like this.\" On the pre-taped programme, the contestant is presented with eight men who may or may not be her natural father.\nIf she picks the correct man from the line-up, the contestant wins the jackpot prize of US$100,000 (£52,590). However, if she picks the wrong man, then the impostor takes the money. Fox producers defended the show, saying it was a \"positive experience\". They have made six specials, though only one episode has so far been broadcast.\n\"The special was thoroughly vetted by our standards and practices department to ensure that it was appropriate for broadcast,\" said a Fox spokesman. \"However, any network affiliate that feels the programming may be inappropriate for their individual market has the right to pre-empt the schedule.\" WRAZ-TV instead chose to air an independently-produced film, I Have Roots and Branches... Personal Reflections on Adoption, a documentary about families with adopted children. \"We just don't think adoption is a game show,\" said Tommy Schenck, WRAZ-TV's general manager, though he said his decision had not been influenced by public protests.",
    "Tory leader Michael Howard says his party can save £35bn in government spending by tackling waste.\nThe money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the NHS and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes. The Tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his MPs, Robert Jackson, a former minister, to Labour. Mr Howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election. \"Let's be realistic - the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what Mr Jackson did\", he told BBC 1's Breakfast with Frost programme. However the defection on Saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the Conservatives' spending plans. Fuller details are due to be unveiled on Monday.\nThe bulk of the £35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, Mr Howard said. The £12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing, he added. However, the remainder would deal with some of the \"unfair taxes\". \"Almost every independent expert says if you get another Labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes,\" Mr Howard insisted. \"Because borrowing is going up, it is out of control, that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both. \"So part of the £12bn we are going to apply to filling the government's black hole, reducing the borrowing. \"The rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today.\"\nMr Howard is expected to say that around £6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on Monday. The cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble-shooter David James. Home Office spending could be cut by £1.6bn, according to the final instalment of his year-long review. Savings of £153m at the Foreign Office and £336m at the Department for Culture Media and Sport, have also been identified. In all, almost a quarter of a million jobs and 168 public bodies would go under Mr James' proposals.\nMr Howard said: \"All this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a Conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less.\" However, Chief Treasury Secretary Paul Boateng said: \"None of the Tories' figures add up so they can't make these savings and can't pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the Tories is £35bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard.\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy added: \"People will not be taken in by Michael Howard's claims of £35bn worth of savings. \"This can't be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities.\" A poll for the News of the World newspaper suggests the Conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century. Labour will hold key marginal constituencies, winning a majority of 160, the Populus survey suggests. And the Liberal Democrats will take three key seats from the Conservatives, leaving the Tories with just 163 MPs, two less than they returned atLabour's 1997 landslide and their worst showing since 1906.",
    "Australian airline Qantas has posted a record fiscal first-half profit thanks to cost-cutting measures.\nNet profit in the six months ending 31 December rose 28% to A$458.4m ($357.6m; £191m) from a year earlier. Analysts expected a figure closer to A$431m. Qantas shares fell almost 3%, however, after it warned that earnings growth would slow in the second half. Sales will dip by at least A$30m after the Indian ocean tsunami devastated many holiday destinations, Qantas said.\n\"The tsunami affected travel patterns in ways that we were a bit surprised about,\" chief executive Geoff Dixon explained. \"It certainly affected Japanese travel into Australia. As soon as the tsunami hit we saw ... a lessening with bookings for Australia.\" Higher fuel costs also are expected to eat into earnings in coming months. \"We don't have as much hedging benefit in the second half as we had in the first,\" said chief financial officer Peter Gregg. Qantas is facing increased pressure from rivals such as low-cost carrier Virgin Blue and the Australian government is in talks about whether to allow Singapore Airlines to fly between the Australia and the US - one of Qantas' key routes.\nEven so, the firm is predicting that full-year earnings will increase from the previous 12 months. Analysts have forecast full-year profit will rise about 11% to around A$720 million ($563 million). Qantas boss Mr Dixon also said he would be reviewing the group's cost-cutting measures. During the first six months of the fiscal year, Qantas made savings of A$245m, and is on track to top its target of A$500m for the full year. Last month, the company warned it may transfer as many as 7,000 jobs out Australia, with Mr Dixon quoted as saying that the carrier could no longer afford to remain \"all-Australian\".",
    "Aid workers trying to house, feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the Sudanese region of Darfur are getting a helping hand from advanced mapping technology.\nA European consortium of companies and university groups known as Respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps. The aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed. Respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly. \"Respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks, for the rivers and for the villages, to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes,\" said Einar Bjorgo from Unosat, the UN satellite mapping organisation that is part of the Respond consortium.\nThe group uses satellites from Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation. The satellite data is transmitted to ground stations. From there, the information makes its way to Respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data. \"You have to convert the data into images, then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis, damage, or situation maps,\" said Stefan Voigt, who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations, the German Aerospace Centre.\nThis kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but Respond gets it done in about 12 hours. \"Our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery, reading satellite maps, so it's our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very, very efficiently,\" said Mr Voigt. Respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web, and on compact disc. But the best map is one you can hold in your hands, especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce. \"A map is a working document,\" explains Herbert Hansen of Respond's Belgian partner Keyobs. \"You need to use it, you need to write on it, correct, give feedback and so on, so you need paper to write on. \"We print maps, we laminate the maps, we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map, it's completely protected.\"\nHumanitarian groups in Darfur have been making good use of Respond's maps. They have come in especially handy during Sudan's rainy season, when normally dry riverbeds, or wadis, became flooded. \"These wadis had a very small amount of flooding, generally, in terms of depth, but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground,\" says Stephen Candillon of Respond imaging partner Sertit. Respond's rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis, allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times. Aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it.\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production",

We took some time off for Christmas, but generally we're doing another record,\" Barrow told the digital radio station. News of their album plans comes after confirmation the Bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam's Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.\n\"We've just had our heads down really, we've never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. \"So for us it just seems, even though we haven't played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven't released a record for a long time.\" Portishead will not play any new material at next month's concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Other acts appearing include Liverpool band The Coral and former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Dummy was a critics' favourite in 1994, hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.",

    "French stock market regulator AMF has filed complaints against media giant Vivendi Universal, its boss and another top executive.\nIt believes the prospectus for a bond issue was unclear and that executives may have had privileged information. AMF has begun proceedings against Vivendi, its chief executive Jean-Rene Fourtou and chief operating officer Jean-Bernard Levy. Vivendi advisor Deutsche Bank was also the subject of a complaint filing. Deutsche Bank, which was responsible for selling the convertible bonds to investors, could face penalties if the complaint is upheld.\nVivendi has said it believes there is \"no legal basis\" for the complaints. The watchdog is said to believe the executive pair were party to \"privileged information\" surrounding the issue of the bonds. Both men bought some of the bonds, the Associated Press news agency reported. AMF is investigating claims that the duo were aware of an interest in Vivendi's US assets from investor Marvin Davis, at the time of the bond sale. Vivendi, however, has said that the information was public knowledge as Mr Davis' offer for the US assets had already been rejected by Vivendi's board. AMF is also looking into whether the executives knew that Vivendi was considering exercising its right to buy British Telecom's shares in Cegetel. Vivendi has rejected the charge, saying the decision to buy the Cegetel shares was \"no more than a possibility, of which the public was perfectly aware\" at the time of the bond issue. Back in December, Vivendi and its former chief executive Jean-Marie Messier were each fined 1m euros ($1.3m; £690,000) by AMF. The fines came after a 15-month probe into allegations that the media giant misled investors after a costly acquisition programme went wrong.",

    "Talks aimed at averting national strikes over pension reforms have ended without agreement after 90 minutes.\nFive public sector unions met Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at the Labour spring conference in Gateshead. They want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. Up to 1.4 million workers could take part in strikes earmarked for 23 March. Discussions will resume next week.\nA spokesman for Unison, Britain's biggest union, said after Saturday's meeting: \"At least we are still talking.\" All sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape. In four days, Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes. Other public sector unions have pledged to follow. The five unions which met Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. This would allow months of tough negotiations to follow, said our correspondent. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April.\nPrivately ministers believe this will be the \"less painful\" option, our correspondent added. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. \"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.\"\nUnison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. It is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.",
    "President Bush has presented his 2006 budget, cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at $427bn (£230bn) this year.\nThe $2.58 trillion (£1.38 trillion) budget submitted to Congress affects 150 domestic programmes from farming to the environment, education and health. But foreign aid is due to rise by 10%, with more money to treat HIV/Aids and reward economic and political reform. Military spending is also set to rise by 4.8%, to reach $419.3bn. The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.\nCongress will spend several months debating George W Bush's proposal.\nThe state department's planned budget would rise to just under $23bn - a fraction of the defence department's request - including almost $6bn to assist US allies in the \"war on terror\". However, the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle HIV/Aids, the BBC's Jonathan Beale reports, and planned spending would almost double to $3bn, with much of that money going to African nations. Mr Bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his Millennium Challenge Corporation. The scheme has been set up to reward developing countries that embrace what the US considers to be good governance and sound policies. Yet Mr Bush's proposed spending of $3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of $5bn.\nA key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration's proposed radical overhaul of Social Security, the pensions programme on which many Americans rely for their retirement income.\nSome experts believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5 trillion over a 20-year period. Neither does the budget include any cash to purchase crude oil for the US emergency petroleum stockpile. Concern over the level of the reserve, created in 1970s, has led to rises in oil prices over the past year. The Bush administration will instead continue to fill the reserve by taking oil - rather than cash - from energy companies that drill under federal leases.\nThe outline proposes reductions in budgets at 12 out of 23 government agencies including cuts of 9.6% at Agriculture and 5.6% at the Environmental Protection Agency. The spending plan for the year beginning 1 October is banking on a healthy US economy to boost government income by 6.1% to $2.18 trillion. Spending is forecast to grow by 3.5% to $2.57 trillion. But the budget is still the tightest yet under Mr Bush's presidency. \"In order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government,\" Mr Bush said in his budget message to Congress. Mr Bush has promised to halve the US's massive budget deficit within five years. The deficit, partly the result of massive tax cuts early in Mr Bush's presidency, has been a key factor in pushing the US dollar lower. The independent Congressional Budget Office estimates that the shortfall could shrink to little more than $200bn by 2009, returning to the surpluses seen in the late 1990s by 2012. But its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent, in line with the promise when they were passed that they would \"sunset\", or disappear, in 2010. Most Republicans, however, want them to stay in place. And the figures also rely on the \"Social Security trust fund\" - the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions - being offset against the main budget deficit.",
    "Fans who buy tickets for this year's Glastonbury festival will be issued with photo ID cards in an attempt to beat touts, it has been confirmed.\nThe cards will include a photograph of the ticket-holder plus an electronic chip with their details to prevent tickets being sold on or forged. Tickets for the June event are expected to go on sale in April. \"There is only one place in the world where you will be able to get tickets,\" festival organiser Michael Eavis said. \"That will be the official source. If you get them anywhere else, you won't get in.\" Fans not wanting to carry the entrance card could present their passport or driving licence instead, he added.\nMore than 153,000 people are expected to travel to Mr Eavis' Somerset farm from 24-26 June, but the event's rising popularity has meant an extremely high demand for tickets in recent years. When the ID card idea was floated, Mr Eavis' daughter Emily said it would be \"quite a big step in terms of ticketing for events\" if implemented and they were \"going as far as we can\" to cut touting. \"As long as it's approached in the right way, it might really work, it might really change the system,\" she said. In 2004, all 112,000 tickets for the public sold out in 24 hours. They were personalised with the names of purchasers, who were asked to bring identification, such as a driving licence, passport or household bill. But some forgot to take the right information while some touts simply offered to supply their own bills along with the ticket bearing their name. No details of this year's line-up have been confirmed but rumours have suggested U2 and Coldplay may be among the headliners.",
    "A British author has had the film rights to her children's bestseller snapped up for a seven-figure sum, with Ridley Scott set to direct.\nMichelle Paver's Wolf Brother, a fantasy set 6,000 years ago, is the first in a planned series of six books. Film studio Fox has bought the rights for around $4m (£2.13m) for Scott's company Scott Free to develop. The director said he was \"thrilled\" with the project. \"Wolf Brother is an enchanting book,\" he said. Paver, who lives in London and previously worked as a lawyer, began writing the book in 1982 while studying biochemistry at Oxford University.\nShe was an established author of love stories when she turned the work-in-progress into a children's novel. It was published in 2004, with Paver earning an advance of $5m (£2.8m) - the highest sum ever paid for a debut children's book. Wolf Brother tells the story of Torak, a 12-year-old hunter who lives in the forest. After his father is killed he teams up with a wolf cub and sets out to rid the forest of an evil force. Paver is currently writing the second book in the series. \"Michelle Paver lives and breathes the worlds she writes about,\" said a spokesman for the author. \"I've told her about the film deal but at the moment she is writing the second book and her mind is 6000 years away deep in the primeval forest.\"",
    "Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet \"rogue-dialling\" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.\nIt has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge. Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. They must warn people earlier about possible fraud, Icstis said.\nPeople who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. Victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: \"Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. \"If my bill goes over the usual £50 a month I want to know about it straight away - I don't want to be told when it's hit £750.\"\nPhone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said. \"We alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers,\" he added.\nTelecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said: \"Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary. \"So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach.\" The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.\nGavin Patterson, group managing director for BT Consumer, said \"We do look at customer's calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. \"We're looking at the moment at whether we can improve this.\" But as BT handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was \"quite a task in itself\", he added. The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. At the moment, it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down.\nI use free anti-virus software (AVG) and free firewall protection (ZoneAlarm). Both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter's love of music sites. How about ISPs informing all customers of such facilities? The responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues.\nIgnorance is and always has been an expensive business.\nDoes any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised? The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ?\nThese diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal MP3s, porn and pirated software. If people didn't visit such sites they'd be considerably less at risk. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? It seems everyone has to be a 'victim' these days!\nPart of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. A secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user's knowledge.\nThese scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. They should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. Or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going?\nWhy don't BT et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request? To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. After you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions, they cannot insist on you paying the bill. To do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. No customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills.\nDisable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. Or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. You would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your PC? Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault!\nI was very impressed with our phone company recently. I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number. Great service. And I got the tickets as well!\nI have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. Three months later another huge bill of over £1,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place. Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.\nI have been scammed of £139. The operator will do nothing about this and, to add insult to injury, I was charged VAT by the government.\nPremium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.\nI know people who have run up large bills, despite being IT-literate. From talking to BT in Belfast, I believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. It's not the fault of phone companies, and at last they are doing something about it.\nIt's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! Not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly.\nI haven't \"fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam\" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. In most cases the user is entirely at fault, which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them.\nMy telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal £3 to £5, to £320. This was because of the scam. They simply billed me. What particularly galls me, over and above having over £300 stolen, is that the supplier and the government (through VAT) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses.\nHow about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted? That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. At least any disputed amount would be limited, far easier for a telecoms operator to write off £20 than it is £750.\nA few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection.\nHow about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date? That should prevent the vast majority of these scams.",
    "Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.\nLabour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. She says she will fight on her record \"as a hard-working constituency MP\". Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to \"change the face\" of UK politics. His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point.\nOn Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". He said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration and promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.\nUKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.\nUKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. UKIP's leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.",
    "UK firms are embracing internet trading opportunities as never before, e-commerce minister Mike O'Brien says.\nA government-commissioned study ranked the UK third in its world index of use of information and communication technology (ICT). The report suggests 69% of UK firms are now using broadband and that 30% of micro businesses are trading online. Mr O'Brien said UK businesses were sprinting forward in ICT use, but that there were more challenges ahead. The report, carried out independently by consultants Booz Allen Hamilton and HI Europe, placed the UK third behind Sweden and Ireland for business use of ICT.\nIt showed British business brought greater maturity to their ICT use, by using broadband in increased numbers, bringing ICT into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences. Mr O'Brien said: \"The increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that UK companies are embracing the opportunities that ICT can bring. \"It is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years.\" The government would play its part in \"cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish\", Mr O'Brien said. The \"clear message\" the report sends is that effective use of ICT can bring real improvements in business performance for all business.\n\"However, we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the UK is to reach its aim of becoming a world-leading e-economy,\" he added. The International Benchmarking Study was based on 8,000 telephone interviews with businesses, of which more than 2,700 were UK businesses. It is the eighth in a series of examining the adoption and deployment of ICT in the world's most industrialised nations.",
    "British TV viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading US shows from the net, according to research.\nNew episodes of 24, Desperate Housewives and Six Feet Under, appear on the web hours after they are shown in the US, said a report. Web tracking company Envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the UK and that downloads of TV programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. About 70% were using file-sharing program BitTorrent, the firm said. \"It's now as easy to download a pirate TV show as it is to programme a VCR,\" said Ben Coppin from Envisional. A typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100,000 people globally, said the report, and an estimated 20,000 of those were from within the UK.\nFans of many popular US TV programmes, like 24, usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the UK. But in some cases, said the report, people were able to watch the new episodes in Britain before US audiences on the west coast of the country. \"Missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet,\" explained Mr Coppin.\n\"Two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. In effect, the internet is now a global video recorder.\" Exact figures are difficult to pin down, but it is thought that about 80,000 to 100,000 people in the UK download TV programmes. Some may just want the odd episode, others are downloading regularly. Many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content, like TV programmes. This presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. It is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. The industry has coined the term \"time-shifting\" to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want, when you want. The increased popularity of personal digital video recorders, TiVo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like Sky+, have also contributed to the trend. There are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store TV programmes for viewers, effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer.\nWithin half an hour, recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. Because they tend to be shorter then full-length films, they can be processed - digitised - quickly. More people with high-speed broadband connections in the UK also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly.\nAccording to Jupiter Research 40% of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. The Envisional reports said that the TV industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. The BBC ran a trial of what it calls the Interactive Media Player (iMP) last year, which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. It let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. It is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. The BBC already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. About six million people in the UK now have a fast, always-on net connection via cable or phone lines.",
    "The top civil servant at the centre of the David Blunkett visa affair has been knighted in the New Year Honours.\nSir John Gieve was Home Office permanent secretary during the saga which ended with Mr Blunkett quitting. He and other civil servants were criticised for failing to recall how the visa for Mr Blunkett's ex-lover's nanny came to be fast-tracked. The outgoing head of the troubled Child Support Agency Doug Smith also earns an honour in the New Year's list. Mr Smith, 57, whose retirement was announced by Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Smith in November, is made a Commander of the Order of Bath.\nBoth men were giving evidence to a Commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency, which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments, when the announcement was made. The knighting of Sir John, 54, will be received with astonishment by opposition politicians.\nThe Liberal Democrats said it \"beggared belief\" he and fellow officials could not remember how Leoncia Casalme's application for indefinite leave to remain went from Mr Blunkett's office to the head of the Immigration and Nationality Department. Meanwhile, the Conservatives accused officials of a \"collective failure\" of memory. But Sir Alan Budd, who led an inquiry into the affair, said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information.\nDowning Street defended the decision to honour both men, with a spokesperson saying: \"You have to look at their whole career.\" Sir John was made permanent secretary in April 2001 following a Civil Service career which dates back to 1974. He has also worked in the Treasury and the Department of Employment. A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said of Mr Smith's honour: \"The award reflects all that he has achieved in a Civil Service career, principally in the Inland Revenue, spanning over 40 years - not just his role as chief executive of the Child Support Agency.\n\"In his career he has personally led a number of successful major change programmes.\" Mr Smith is set to stay on at the CSA until March. Less controversial will be the knighthoods for Derek Wanless and Mike Tomlinson, who undertook major government reviews on health and education respectively. Former NatWest chief executive Mr Wanless, 57, has delivered not one but two major reports on the NHS. Ex-chief inspector of schools Mr Tomlinson, 62, has recommended replacing A-Levels and GCSEs with a new diploma system in a shake-up of the exams system.",

    "Ulster clung on for a morale-boosting Celtic League win over bottom club Borders at Netherdale on Friday night.\nA late try by Borders substitute Jonny Weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the Scottish side could not complete the fightback. Ulster had led 20-6 with tries from Paul Steinmetz and Bryn Cunningham. But the Irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. Calum MacRae surrendered possession before centre Steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. Substitute Joe Pattison - who had come on for the injured Gareth Morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.\nThe speedy Steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving Adam Larkin an easy conversion. Ally Warnock clawed back three points for Borders, but they were soon hit by another double-blow. First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward. Larkin again added the extras. Even worse was to come for Borders when Larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to Kelly Brown being sin-binned. The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end. And he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory. \"Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time,\" said McCall. \"In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.\"\nMorton, Moffat, MacRae, Hore, Berthinussen, Warnock, Moore, Thomson, Ford, Douglas, Blair, Stewart, Gray, Brown, McEntee.\nKay, Parr, McGee, Rennick, Weston, Millar, Pattison.\nCunningham, Maxwell, Bell, Steinmetz, Howe, Larkin, Campbell, S.

    "Two moments of magic from Brian O'Driscoll guided Ireland to a workmanlike victory against Italy.\nA pair of classic outside breaks from the Ireland captain set up tries for Geordan Murphy and Peter Stringer. Italy led 9-8 early in the second half but Stringer's try gave Ireland a lead they never lost. The hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through Ludovico Nitoglia, but Denis Hickie's try ensured an Irish victory. Italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a Luciano Orquera penalty after seven minutes.\nIt could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and Ireland drew level with a Ronan O'Gara penalty midway through the first half. The Italians were driving at the heart of the Irish defence and, for the first quarter, the Irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs.\nWhen they finally did, just before the half-hour mark, O'Driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for Murphy. The Ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving Murphy in at the corner. O'Gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. Roland de Marigny took over the kicking duties for Italy from the hapless Orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge Italy into a 9-8 lead.\nThe only Ireland player offering a real threat was O'Driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. Shane Horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and Stringer scooted over, with O'Gara landing the tricky conversion. A penalty apiece saw Ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when Italy launched a series of attacks. Winger Nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and Italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul.\nAn O'Gara penalty put Ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when Hickie latched onto an inside pass from Murphy and crossed for a converted try. O'Driscoll limped off late on, joining centre partner Gordon D'Arcy on the sidelines, and the final word went to Italy. Prop Martin Castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an Italian pack which had kept the Irish under pressure throughout.\nDe Marigny; Mi Bergamasco, Canale, Masi, Nitoglia; Orquera, Troncon; Lo Cicero, Ongaro, Castrogiovanni; Dellape, Bortolami; Persico, Ma Bergamasco, Parisse.\nPerugini, Intoppa, Del Fava, Dal Maso, Griffen, Pozzebon, Robertson.\nMurphy, Horgan, O'Driscoll, D'Arcy, Hickie, O'Gara, Stringer, Corrigan, Byrne, Hayes, O'Kelly, O'Connell, S Easterby, Leamy, Foley.\nSheahan, Horan, O'Callaghan, Miller, G Easterby, Humphreys, Dempsey.\nP O'Brien (New Zealand)",
    "When you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential.\nIreland coach Eddie O'Sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run-up to this season's Six Nations Championship. He decreed after the 2003 World Cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year. That became a reality at the end of last summer with a 10-week period at the start of the this season. It may have annoyed his Scottish, and in particularly Welsh, cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the Celtic League. We will say nothing of Mike Ruddock ''poaching'' eight of the Dragons side that faced Leinster on Sunday. But, like O'Sullivan, he was well within his rights, particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it. The IRFU has thrown their weight behind O'Sullivan, who must be glad that in the main, there is centrally-controlled contracts. Bar Keith Gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg, everyone of O'Sullivan's squad is fit, fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season's campaign.\nBut I doubt whether O'Sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players. He is not that sort of person. However, he may look at the overworked and injury-hit England, Wales and France squads whose players have been overworked, and then pat himself on the back for his foresight. But there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game. Already Ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season. A first Grand Slam since Karl Mullen's led the team to a clean sweep in 1948. With England and France visiting Lansdowne Road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down, everything looks perfectly placed. But in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any Irishman.\nUnder the burden of great expectations, Ireland have crumpled. Take the Triple Crown-winning side of 1985 under Mick Doyle. They were expected to up the ante further for a Grand Slam, only the second in Ireland's history. What happened in 1986? Whitewashed. You see, Ireland, in any sport, love to be downsized. Then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary. It is the nature of the beast. But O'Sullivan's side are very capable of proving a salient point this season. After their first Triple Crown for 19 years, they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder. O'Sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players, and they have repaid him in spades ... and there is more to come. He has some old dogs in his squad, but he will come to this season's championship with a different box of tricks, and a new verve to succeed. Ireland can indeed succeed, but just whisper it.",
    "Former world number one Juan Carlos Ferrero insists he can get back to his best despite a tough start to 2005.\nThe 2003 French Open champion has slipped to 64 in the world after a year of illness and injuries in 2004, but is confident that his form will return. \"I don't know when it is going to happen,\" Ferrero told BBC Sport. \"But I have a lot of confidence in me that I will be the same Juan Carlos as I was before, and very soon. I feel 100% again mentally.\" The 25-year-old Spaniard joins a top field for the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam this week as he looks to add to just two wins in 2005. He opens against Rainer Schuettler and potentially faces fourth seed David Nalbandian in the second round. \"Because I'm no longer seeded it's tougher,\" Ferrero admitted. \"I had to play against Joachim Johansson in the first round last week in Marseille.\n\"In the past when I was a top seed I would have played a match like that in the quarters or semi-finals. \"This is the big difference but I have to do it to get higher in the rankings.\" Despite this, Ferrero insists he is feeling positive after chicken pox and a rib injury destroyed last season. \"Physically I am 100% since December of last year,\" said Ferrero. \"I was working very hard before the Davis Cup final to prepare and I've felt 100% from then until now. \"The difficult moments were when I knew that I had the chicken pox and that it would take two or three months to recover. \"I had to start from zero again physically because the virus left me at zero per cent. \"When I started to come back I had my rib broken when I fell on court and that was another two months out. Those five months were pretty difficult for me.\"\nAmong the low points of a difficult year for Ferrero was the decision of Spain captain Jordi Arrese to drop him for the Davis Cup final against the USA. \"It was difficult because I had been playing well for the whole year and the coaches told me that I would play,\" said Ferrero. \"But then I had some problems with my hand two days before the Friday matches so they decided to choose Nadal instead. \"It was difficult for me not to be in the Friday matches but I had to understand. \"Inside me I wanted to play but this was the decision of the captain and they had to make it.\"",
    "Mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales, according to research from technology analysts Gartner.\nMore than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally, said the report, the highest total sold to date. The figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions, Gartner said. Good design and the look of a mobile, as well as new services such as music downloads, could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005, said analysts. Although people were still looking for better replacement phones, there was evidence, according to Gartner, that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales.\n\"All the markets grew apart from Japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western Europe,\" mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi told the BBC News website. \"Japan is where north America and western European markets can be in a couple of years' time. \"They already have TV, music, ringtones, cameras, and all that we can think of on mobiles, so people have stopped buying replacement phones.\"\nBut there could be a slight slowdown in sales in European and US markets too, according to Gartner, as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. This means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade, said Gartner. Third generation mobiles (3G) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer, like video, could drive people into upgrading their phones, but Ms Milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen. \"At the end of the day, people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don't really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical.\" Nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. The majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms.\nMore likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics, as well as music services. The Motorola Razr V3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005, she added. This was not a \"women's thing\", she said, but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. It was not just about how the phone functioned, but about what it said about its owner. \"Western Europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design,\" said Ms Milanesi.\n\"People are after something that is nice-looking, and together with that, there is the entertainment side. \"This year music will have a part to play in this.\" The market for full-track music downloads was worth just $20 million (£10.5 million) in 2004, but is set to be worth $1.8 billion (£9.4 million) by 2009, according to Jupiter Research. Sony Ericsson just released its Walkman branded mobile phone, the W800, which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours' battery life, and a two megapixel camera. In July last year, Motorola and Apple announced a version of iTunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with Motorola mobile phones. Apple said the new iTunes music player would become Motorola's standard music application for its music phones. But the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the iPod. Ms Milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. But they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity, which would not put too much strain on battery life.",
    "Software giant Microsoft is taking the plunge into the world of blogging.\nIt is launching a test service to allow people to publish blogs, or online journals, called MSN Spaces. Microsoft is trailing behind competitors like Google and AOL, which already offer services which make it easy for people to set up web journals. Blogs, short for web logs, have become a popular way for people to talk about their lives and express opinions online.\nMSN Spaces is free to anyone with a Hotmail or MSN Messenger account. People will be able to choose a layout for the page, upload images and share photo albums and music playlists. The service will be supported by banner ads. \"This is a simple tool for people to express themselves,\" said MSN's Blake Irving. This is Microsoft's first foray into blogging, which has taken off as a web phenomenon in the past year. Competitors like Google already offer free services through its Blogger site, while AOL provides its members with journals. Accurate figures for the number of blogs in existence are hard to come by. According to blog analysis firm Technorati, the so-called blogosphere, has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. It now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million, although some speculate that less than a quarter are regularly maintained.",
    "All Blacks captain Tama Umaga has warned the British and Irish Lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour.\nBut Umaga, in England for Saturday's IRB Rugby Aid match, also backed New Zealand to win the three-Test series against the Lions. He told BBC Sport: \"It's potentially the most fearsome line-up I've ever come up against. They're awesome. \"But I'd back us all the way to beat them when they come over.\" Lions boss Sir Clive Woodward is set to announce his squad for the June-July tour next month.\nWhen Woodward was appointed last year, it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former England players. But Umaga said: \"He'd be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the Six Nations. \"Don't get me wrong, England have got a lot of talented guys and I'm sure there are some of them who'll make the Lions Test XV. \"But you can't disguise Wales and Ireland in particular. Some of the tries they've scored have been great. I'll admit it'll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of Brian O'Driscoll.\"\nUmaga will meet O'Driscoll in Saturday's Rugby Aid match at Twickenham, with the Irish captain leading the Northern Hemisphere side. O'Driscoll is among a host of players in the Northern Hemisphere squad, coached by Woodward, that are tipped for Lions call-ups. \"It'll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys, although a lot can change between now and June,\" Umaga said. The 31-year-old admitted interest in the Lions tour was immense, calling it \"the biggest thing to hit New Zealand since Lord of the Rings\". He added: \"As players, it's enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the Lions. In fact, it's not just us All Blacks - it's the talk of the country.\"\nUmaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of Saturday's charity game, which features a host of big names including George Gregan, Andrew Mehrtens and Chris Latham. But he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over. \"The second [Southern Hemisphere coach] Rod Macqueen made the approach, I didn't hesitate. It was great when New Zealand Rugby then gave me the all clear. \"Thankfully I didn't know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn't miss all the horrific reports on the news. \"There are so many people that were affected, are still affected and will be affected for a long time. It's just good to know we can do something minor to help out.\"\n- The match will be televised on BBC One at 1400 GMT on Saturday.",
    "Michael Howard is to make a pitch for Britain's ethnic vote urging people who feel \"taken for granted\" by Tony Blair to vote Conservative.\nHe will say Conservatives \"share the same values\" as the UK's minorities. And that he wants to build a \"better Britain\" where everyone, whatever the colour of their skin or religion, can \"make the most of their talents\". But the Tory leader will argue against positive discrimination saying it is \"outdated and unjust\".\n\"It sets family against family and it leads ethnic communities to doubt their own abilities,\" he will argue. Mr Howard - himself the son of immigrants - will acknowledge that racial discrimination still exists in the UK. \"People from ethnic communities, for example, still earn less than their white counterparts,\" he will say before arguing the answer to helping everyone to get on was \"free enterprise, free trade, free speech\". The Tory leader will also call for religious tolerance arguing that Hindus and Sikhs as well as Muslims got \"caught in the downdraft of Islamaphobia which was one of the terrible side effects of 9/11\".\nMr Howard will make his speech during a visit to support Tory Parliamentary hopefuls Robert Light and Sayeeda Warsi - \"the first British Muslim woman\" selected to run for MP as a Conservative candidate. He will attack Labour's record in government over issues such as tax and he will set out Tory plans for an immigration quota to be set by MPs. Mr Howard will also attack the Lib Dems for wanting to abolish faith schools, introduce compulsory sex education from the age of seven, and \"give contraceptives out in schools from the age of 11\". \"So I say to all those people from ethnic minorities who feel Mr Blair and the Liberal Democrats take their votes for granted - come join us,\" he will say. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes branded Mr Howard \"arrogant and wrong\" for claiming the Tories were the \"natural party\" for Britain's ethnic minorities. \"Given the Tories' considerably reduced support in urban areas, where many black and Asian Britons live, during their time in power, the evidence simply does not support his claims that the Conservatives are the party for these communities,\" he said.",
    "Newcastle centre Mathew Tait answered his critics as he scored one try and made another, but he could not stop Gloucester grabbing a draw.\nThe Falcons were 22-6 down at the break before Tait, recently axed by England after just one Six Nations outing, inspired his side to a 27-22 lead. A last-gasp touchdown from Luke Narraway pulled the visitors level. But Gloucester missed out on victory when Henry Paul fluffed the conversion and Seti Kiole was denied a late try. Newcastle had a couple of chances at the start of the second half with line-outs in the corner. But they failed to make them count until Joe Shaw found Dave Walder, who released Mark Mayerholfer in his own 22.\nThe former All Black broke clear and popped the ball up for Tait on halfway. He chipped ahead for Michael Stephenson to scorch through for the try, which Walder converted to give Newcastle a lifeline. They grabbed it with both hands, Mayerhofler breaking through and Tait making a brilliant early run to cut inside and race 30m to score. Walder converted to make it 22-20 before he was just wide with a 40m penalty in the 70th minute.\nMayerhofler then scythed through the middle for a try after Hall Charlton popped the ball up, and Walder's conversion took Newcastle 27-22 ahead. With three minutes of normal time left, Narraway was driven over for a try in the corner which levelled the scores at 27-27. Henry missed the conversion but Gloucester nearly won it when Kiole broke through only to be hauled down by Charlton and Tom May.\nWalder; May, Tait, Mayerhofler, Stephenson; Wilkinson, Grindal; Isaacson, Long, Ward; Gross, Hamilton; McCarthy, Harris, Dowson.\nReplacements: Peel, Wilson, Thompson, Parling, Sititi, Charlton, Shaw.\nGoodridge; Garvey, Simpson-Daniel, Fanolua, Kiole; Paul, Gomarsall; Wood, Curnier, Powell; Eustace, Brown; Forrester, Buxton, Balding.\nReplacements: Elloway, Sigley, Cornwell, Narraway, Page, Davies, Mauger.",
    "Australian tennis' top official has defended the Australian Open courts at Melbourne Park after criticism of the playing surface by Lleyton Hewitt.\nHewitt said he had had a \"gutful\" of trying to persuade them to make the surface faster but Tennis Australia's Geoff Pollard rejected his comments. \"We did ask for it to be made faster than last year and, to my knowledge, it is faster,\" he said. \"We spent a substantial amount of money on modifications to make it faster.\" Hewitt, who has not got past the fourth round at Melbourne in seven attempts, had earlier said the surface was not worthy of such a prestigious tournament. But he said he would play on whatever surface he had to in order to have a chance of winning. The tournament starts on 17 January, and Pollard said the surface had been speeded up since last year's tournament following complaints by several Australian players. But he refused to accept that the Melbourne surface may have had a bearing on Hewitt's performances over the years. \"Lleyton's proving how versatile he is on all surfaces,\" he said. \"It is faster than last year and that'll be faster than the one Lleyton beat Roger Federer on in the Davis Cup in 2003.\"",
    "President Bush is to send his toughest budget proposals to date to the US Congress, seeking large cuts in domestic spending to lower the deficit.\nAbout 150 federal programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of a $2.5 trillion (£1.3 trillion) package aimed at curbing the giant US budget deficit. Defence spending will rise, however, while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in Iraq. Vice-President Dick Cheney said the budget was the \"tightest\" so far.\nAt the heart of the administration's fifth budget, presented to Congress on Monday, is an austere package of domestic measures. These would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation.\nSuch belt-tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of President Bush's first term. Mr Cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the Bush Presidency but argued it was \"fair and responsible\". \"It is not something we have done with a meat axe, nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society,\" he said. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, increased expenditure on national security after 9/11 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by President Bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit. The shortfall is projected to rise to $427bn in 2005.\nEducation, environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as a first step towards reducing the deficit to $230bn by 2009.\nMost controversially, the government is seeking to cut the Medicaid budget, which provides health care to the nation's poorest, by $45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by $587m. Spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase, although not by as much as originally planned. President Bush's proposals would see the Pentagon's budget rise by $19bn to $419.3bn while homeland security would get an extra $2bn.\nThe budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration in expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.\nAlso not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administration's radical proposed overhaul of social security provision. Some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5bn trillion over a twenty year period. Despite the Republicans holding a majority in both houses of Congress, the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months.\nJohn McCain, a Republican Senator, said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit. \"With the deficits that we are now running, I am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget,\" he said. However, Democratic Senator Kent Conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond 2009. \"The cost of everything he [President Bush] advocates explodes,\" he said.",
    "US food and drug regulators will decide on Friday whether to recommend the sale of painkillers that have been linked to a high risk of heart attack and stroke.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel will give its verdict after hearing evidence for three days. The painkillers - called COX-2 inhibitors - are sold under brand names such as Celebrex and Vioxx. Vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but Merck said it would consider selling it if it gets FDA approval. The FDA has been asked to decide if the benefits to patients justify the increased risks.\nPutting Vioxx back on the shelves is likely to boost profits at Merck and make easier any legal battles with people who claim to have been injured by the drug, analysts said.\nMerck voluntarily stopped sales of Vioxx on 30 September, a move which caused the firm's fourth-quarter earnings to slide to $1.1bn (£581m), from $1.4bn a year earlier. Merck's shares tumbled more than 10% on the news and the company has had to set aside millions of dollars to cover the cost of Vioxx-related litigation. Alarm bells were rung by a research note called Approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least 18 months. The Cox-2 inhibitors were developed by drug companies, including Merck and Pfizer, because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers.\nPfizer is still selling its Celebrex and Bextra products, though investigations have suggested that they may also be harmful to the heart. Merck's announcement of a possible reintroduction of Vioxx caught analysts by surprise. Merck's head of research Peter Kim said that it withdrew Vioxx \"based on the information that was available to us at the time, knowing there were alternative therapies\". He went on to say that things have since changed in the light of new reports. \"Given this new information, its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in Approve makes Vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the US,\" Mr Kim explained.\nOn Thursday, David Graham from the FDA's Office of Drug Safety told the advisory panel that \"there really doesn't appear to be a need for Cox-2\" inhibitors. According to calculations presented to the US Senate by Dr Graham in November, Vioxx may be linked to as many as to 56,000 American deaths. Facing stem criticism for its handling of the Vioxx case, the FDA said on Tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place. European regulators, meanwhile, ruled on Thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take Cox-2 inhibitors. The European Medicines Agency also said doctors should be \"cautious\" about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease.",
    "The £10bn Crossrail transport plan, backed by business groups, is to get the go-ahead this month, according to The Mail on Sunday.\nIt says the UK Treasury has allocated £7.5bn ($13.99bn) for the project and that talks with business groups on raising the rest will begin shortly. The much delayed Crossrail Link Bill would provide for a fast cross-London rail link. The paper says it will go before the House of Commons on 23 February.\nA second reading could follow on 16 or 17 March. \"We've always said we are going to introduce a hybrid Bill for Crossrail in the Spring and this remains the case,\" the Department for Transport said on Sunday. Jeremy de Souza, a spokesman for Crossrail, said on Sunday he could not confirm whether the Treasury was planning to invest £7.5bn or when the bill would go before Parliament.\nHowever, he said some impetus may have been provided by the proximity of an election.\nThe new line would go out as far as Maidenhead, Berkshire, to the west of London, and link Heathrow to Canary Wharf via the City. Heathrow to the City would take 40 minutes, dramatically cutting journey times for business travellers, and reducing overcrowding on the tube. The line has the support of the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, business groups and the government, but there have been three years of arguments over how it should be funded. The Mail on Sunday's Financial Mail said the £7.5bn of Treasury money was earmarked for spending in £2.5bn instalments in 2010, 2011 and 2012.",
    "Rock star Ozzy Osbourne has been praised by police for \"very courageously\" tackling a burglar who stole jewellery from his house.\nThe singer grabbed an intruder who then jumped 30ft (10m) from a first floor window as the star gave chase at his Buckinghamshire home on Monday. \"I acted on impulse,\" Osbourne said. \"In hindsight, it could have been a lot worse. It could've got really ugly.\" A £100,000 reward has been offered for information leading to a conviction. His wife Sharon, who called the police, said her wedding rings were taken from her bedside table as she slept.\nThe heavy metal star said he could have met the same fate as late Beatle George Harrison, who was repeatedly stabbed in a break-in in 1999. \"I could have been badly injured or shot or anything,\" Osbourne said. \"I just thank God that no-one got injured.\" He added he was glad the intruders were not hurt. \"I wouldn't want anyone to get injured.\" The singer did not want to talk in detail about his actions but when asked whether he would do the same again replied: \"Is the Pope a Catholic?\" The incident happened at 0400 GMT on Monday in Chalfont St Peter. Detective Inspector Paul Miller of Thames Valley Police said it appeared a man used a ladder to get into the house through a first floor bedroom window. \"Whilst selecting items of jewellery, the burglar was disturbed by Ozzy who very courageously tackled this burglar and pursued him from the house,\" he said. Ozzy said he was \"just coming to grips\" with what had happened and his opinion of the UK had been lowered after 12 relatively trouble-free years in the US.\n\"We lived in Los Angeles where people get shot every day and have been trailed by lots of different stalkers - and yet we come back to England and I'm very disappointed.\" At a press conference on Tuesday, Sharon Osbourne gave details of nine stolen items. They included a diamond wedding ring and two handmade wedding bands Ozzy gave her when they renewed their vows two years ago. She said she wished she had worn them at night. \"I always take them off and put them beside my bed and that's where they were, right beside me on my bedside table.\" Also taken were a pearl necklace and a sapphire bought as an investment for their daughters described by Sharon as \"one of the only 24-carat sapphires that is absolutely pure\".\nA daisy chain necklace that was a 20th anniversary present and a Franck Muller watch Sharon said was one of only 10 made were also stolen. She expressed her anger at the person who \"hasn't worked and wants to take what's yours\". \"But the thing is, we worked for everything. I came from Brixton. Ozzy came from not a very nice part of Birmingham and everything we've got we have worked our arses off for.\" \"If I choose to make an investment for my kids in whatever way I choose to make it, that's my business and I worked for every God damn penny.\" Ozzy also lamented two years in which the family has been plagued by problems, including his critical injury in a quad bike accident, his wife's colon cancer, their childrens' drug problems and now the burglary.\nOn Sunday night, the Osbournes had been celebrating the birthday of singer Sir Elton John's partner David Furnish. Police described the intruder as well-built, about 5' 10\" tall and said he was wearing a ski-mask, a light-coloured jacket and trainers. They believe he may have injured himself when he jumped from the window. There is no description of his accomplice. Police think the pair were driving a large vehicle, possibly a van, and are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen one leaving Chalfont St Peter at speed. Police appealed for public help to find the perpetrators and stolen items on 0845 8 505 505 or 0800 555 111.",
    "Robots are learning lessons on \"robotiquette\" - how to behave socially - so they can mix better with humans.\nBy playing games, like pass-the-parcel, a University of Hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations. The study's findings will eventually help humans develop a code of social behaviour in human-robot interaction. The work is part of the European Cogniron robotics project, and was on show at London's Science Museum.\n\"We are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists,\" said Professor Kerstin Dautenhahn, project leader at Hertfordshire. \"Our mission is to look at how such a robot should be programmed to respect personal spaces of humans.\"\nThe research also focuses on human perception of robots, including how they should look, and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator. \"Without such studies, you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals, have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds,\" Professor Dautenhahn told BBC News Online. \"And I want robots to treat humans as human beings, and not like other robots,\" she added.\nIn most situations, a companion robot will eventually have to deal not only with one person, but also with groups of people. To find out how they would react, the Hertfordshire Cogniron team taught one robot to play pass-the-parcel with children.\nShowing off its skills at the Science Museum, the unnamed robot had to select, approach, and ask different children to pick up a parcel with a gift, moving it arm as a pointer and its camera as an eye. It even used speech to give instructions and play music. However, according to researchers, it will still take many years to build a robot which would make full use of the \"robotiquette\" for human interaction. \"If you think of a robot as a companion for the human being, you can think of 20 years into the future,\" concluded Professor Dautenhahn. \"It might take even longer because it is very, very hard to develop such a robot.\"\nYou can hear more on this story on the BBC World Service's Go Digital programme.",
    "The US has asked the World Trade Organisation to investigate European Union customs tariffs, which it says are inconsistent and hamper trade.\nThe EU's own institutions have noted the uneven way EU customs rules are applied but failed to act, the US Trade Representative's Office said. Small and mid-sized US firms were worst-hit, it added. The EU expanded from 15 to 25 member states in May. The US said it filed the complaint after talks failed to find a solution.\nThe move came in the same week that the US and EU stepped back from confrontation in a tense dispute over aircraft subsidies to European manufacturer Airbus and US firm Boeing. New EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said on Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to reopen talks in the aircraft subsidies row, which led to tit-for-tat WTO filings in last autumn.\nExplaining why it has asked the WTO to set up a dispute settlement panel on customs barriers, the US Trade Representative's Office said that it wants to tackle the issue \"early in the EU's process of dealing with the problems of enlargement\". Ten countries, mostly in Eastern Europe, joined the EU in May. The US said its trade with the 25 EU member countries was worth $155.2bn (£82.8bn) in 2003. \"Although the EU is a customs union, there is no single EU customs administration,\" a statement issued on behalf of Robert Zoellick, US Trade Representative, said. Lack of uniformity, coupled with lack of procedures for prompt EU-wide review can hinder US exports, especially for small to mid-sized businesses\", An EU spokesman in Washington dismissed the US complaint. \"We think the US case is very weak. They haven't come up with any evidence that US companies are being harmed,\" said Anthony Gooch. It could take several months for the WTO's dispute settlement panel to report its findings.",
    "Police are investigating a British National Party leaflet posted to homes in south Wales opposing plans for a new mosque.\nAnti-racism campaigners in Swansea have handed copies to South Wales Police. Swansea's Muslim community is raising money to open a new mosque and community centre in the former St Andrews United Reform Church. The building on George Street has been derelict since the 1980s.\nTaha Idris, director of the Swansea Bay Race Equality Council, said his organisation contacted police after receiving complaints from the public. \"I'm quite shocked to see this sort of leaflet by the BNP in Swansea,\" he said.\n\"The BNP has tried in the past to get into Swansea and this is another example of them trying again. \"I am in no doubt that the BNP are not needed and not wanted here.\" A South Wales Police spokeswoman confirmed that they were looking at the contents of the leaflet. According to the BNP's website, they have been posted to homes in the Castle ward. The BNP website carries a photograph of party leader Nick Griffin - who lives near Welshpool, mid Wales - delivering the leaflet. The BNP has denied it is trying to stir up hatred of any race or religion, but argues that they should be able to debate this without fear of arrest. Swansea Unite Against Fascism (UAF) is meeting this week to plan a campaign. Following the death earlier this year of Kalan Kawa Karim, an Iraqi Kurd living in Swansea, it organised an anti-racism march in the city that was supported by more than 1,000 people. It is planning its own mail shot campaign and may launch a petition in support of the plans for the mosque.\nAndy Richards, of Swansea UAF, said the leaflet was exactly what he had come to expect from the BNP.\n\"The people of Swansea will not put up with this.\" Swansea's Muslim community bought the former church, just across the road from the existing mosque on St Helen's Road, in the late 1990s. Mr Idris said the community was now raising money to renovate the building. \"It is a landmark building in Swansea and would otherwise just crumble,\" he said. \"It is the ideal opportunity for the building to be restored and used in the proper manner. \"It will be a Muslim community centre. It's a holistic place used for education, weddings, deaths and births.\" He said space was limited in the current mosque and on some occasions Muslims had to travel to Llanelli for cultural events.",
    "Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venice's famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.\nViotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milan's La Scala and the Vienna State Opera. His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet's Manon last week.\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti's last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Vienna State Opera.",
    "Sir Joshua Reynolds' Portrait of Omai will get a public airing following fears it would stay hidden because of an export wrangle.\nThe Tate Gallery unsuccessfully tried to buy the picture from its anonymous owner after a ban was issued preventing the painting from leaving the UK. The 18th Century painting has remained in storage but the owner has agreed to allow it to be part of an exhibition. The exhibition of Reynolds' work will be shown at Tate Britain from May. Joshua Reynolds: The Creation of Celebrity will feature prints, caricatures, and sculpture by the 18th Century artist, who painted some of the most famous personalities of his day. Portrait of Omai fetched the second highest amount for a British painting when it was sold at auction for £10.3m in 2001. It was bought by a London dealer who sold it on to a collector. The unnamed collector wanted to take it out of the country, but was barred from doing so by the government because of its historical significance.\nIn March 2004, the Tate managed to raise £12.5m funding to buy the portrait but the owner refused to sell and it has been held in storage since. The portrait is of a young man who was dubbed \"the noble savage\" when he arrived in London from Polynesia. He became a darling of London society and was invited to all the best parties by people who were fascinated by such an exotic character. Sir Joshua painted him after his arrival in 1774, and it became the artist's most famous work after it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1776.",
    "Britain has offered to send a company of 120 Gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia, Downing Street said.\nThe deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province. Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.\nHowever a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in Indonesia which the Gurkhas might be able to help with. The spokesman said: \"Following this morning's daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort, the government has formally offered the Indonesian government the assistance of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters. \"This is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean.\"\nIndonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami, with 94,000 of the 140,000 confirmed deaths so far. International Development Minister Gareth Thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of Aceh. \"We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment,\" he said. \"We've also had RAF aircraft flying in equipment which the UN desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in Aceh province as well.\" The offer comes as the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw arrives in Indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.",
    "Actress Anna Keaveney, who appeared in Brookside, My Family and A Touch of Frost, has died of lung cancer aged 55.\nKeaveney, who played Brookside's Marie Jackson when the Channel 4 soap began in 1982, died on Saturday. Born in Runcorn, Cheshire, she also starred in numerous films including 1989's Shirley Valentine. She played Nellie in Mike Leigh's latest film Vera Drake, which won the Golden Lion prize for best film at this year's Venice Film Festival.\nAnd most recently she appeared alongside Richard Wilson in ITV's King of Fridges and with Martin Clunes in Doc Martin. Other TV appearances included the part of Matron in ITV drama Footballers' Wives and a cameo role as Tom Farrell's mother Sheila in BBC comedy Gimme Gimme Gimme. Keaveney's career also included stage performances in Neaptide for the National Theatre, Private Lives and The Rise and Fall of Little Voice. The actress died in hospital. Her agent Barry Brown said: \"Anna was due to have had another operation on Friday but unfortunately she was too weak.\"",
    "People using wireless net hotspots will soon be able to make free phone calls as well as surf the net.\nWireless provider Broadreach and net telephony firm Skype are rolling out a service at 350 hotspots around the UK this week. Users will need a Skype account - downloadable for free - and they will then be able to make net calls via wi-fi without paying for net access. Skype allows people to make free PC-based calls to other Skype users.\nUsers of the system can also make calls to landlines and mobiles for a fee. The system is gaining in popularity and now has 28 million users around the world. Its paid service - dubbed Skype Out - has so far attracted 940,000 users. It plans to add more paid services with forthcoming launches of video conferencing, voice mail and Skype In, a service which would allow users to receive phone calls from landlines and mobiles. London-based software developer Connectotel has unveiled software that will expand the SMS functions of Skype, allowing users to send text messages to mobile phones from the service. Broadreach Networks has around two million users and hotspots in places such as Virgin Megastores, the Travelodge chain of hotels and all London's major rail terminals. The company is due to launch wi-fi on Virgin Trains later in the year. \"Skype's success at spreading the world about internet telephony is well-known and we are delighted to be offering free access to Skype users in our hotspots,\" commented Broadreach chief executive Magnus McEwen-King.",
    "Ex-Labour MP George Galloway has appealed for the release of aid worker Margaret Hassan, kidnapped in Iraq.\nMrs Hassan, 59, who led Care International operations in Iraq, was abducted in Baghdad on 19 October. Mr Galloway was expelled from the Labour party because of his staunch opposition to the war on Iraq. He denied an earlier report that he planned to make a direct appeal to the kidnappers via the Al-Jazeera Arabic television channel.\nSpeaking in London on Saturday at the first annual delegate conference of his newly-founded party, the Respect Coalition, he said: \"I have deliberately not involved myself before in any of these situations. \"But this woman has been a prominent opponent of both the war and the preceding years of sanctions. \"I am prepared to do anything I can to help save her life.\" A spokesman later said Mr Galloway had friends in common with Ms Hassan, who he described as a prominent anti-war activist, and that he was \"willing to do anything - go to Iraq or be an intermediary or anything that's necessary\". Since her abduction, several videos of Mrs Hassan have been broadcast by Al-Jazeera. The latest footage showed Mrs Hassan asking for British troops to be pulled out of Iraq. She also urged Care International, the aid agency she works for, to close its office in Baghdad, and appealed for Iraqi women prisoners to be freed. Care has since closed down all its operations in Iraq.",
    "Half of the money put aside by the Colombian government to help the country's poor is benefiting people who do not need it, a study has found.\nA total of 24.2 trillion pesos ($10.2bn; £5.5bn) is earmarked for subsidies for the poor, the government department for planning said. But it also found 12.1 trillion pesos was going to the richest part of the population, rather than to those in need. Sound distribution of the cash could cut poverty levels to 36% from 53%, the government believes. \"Resources are more than enough to reduce poverty and there is no need for more tax reforms but a better distribution,\" deputy planning director Jose Leibovich said.\nColombia has a population of about 44 million and half lives below poverty line. However, some large properties are paying less in tax as they are situated inside poor areas, which benefit from cheaper utilities such as electricity and water, government research found. Government expenditure in areas such as pensions, public services, education, property and health should be revised, Mr Leibovich said. He added that the government is now examining the report, but warned there would be no easy solution to the problem. With a good distribution of such subsidies and economic growth of just 2%, by 2019 poverty could fall as low as 15.3%, he said.",
    "In a sign of a thaw in relations between Egypt and Israel, the two countries have signed a trade protocol with the US, allowing Egyptian goods made in partnership with Israeli firms free access to American markets.\nThe protocol, signed in Cairo, will establish what are called \"qualified industrial zones\" in Egypt. Products from these zones will enjoy duty free access to the US, provided that 35% of their components are the product of Israeli-Egyptian cooperation. The US describes this as the most important economic agreement between Egypt and Israel in two decades.\nThe protocol establishing the zones has been stalled for years. There has been deep sensitivity in Egypt about any form of co-operation with Israel as long as its peace process with the Palestinians remains blocked. But in recent weeks an unusual warmth has crept into relations between the two countries. Both exchanged prisoners earlier this month, with Egypt handing back an Israeli who has served eight years in prison after being convicted for spying.\nEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak has described Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as the best chance for the Palestinians to achieve peace. The government in Cairo now believes Mr Sharon is moving towards the centre and away from the positions of right wing groups. It also believes the US, pressed by Europe, is now more willing to engage seriously in the search for a settlement. But there are also pressing economic reasons for Egypt's decision to enter into the trade agreement. It will give a huge boost to Egyptian textile exports, which are about to suffer a drop after new regulations come into force in the US at the beginning of the year.",
    "The UK pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by a leading retirement think-tank.\nThe Pensions Policy Institute (PPI) said replacing the state pension with a \"citizen's pension\" would help tackle inequality and complexity. The change would see pensions being calculated on length of residency in the UK rather than National Insurance (NI) contributions. Reform could reduce poverty by aiding people with broken employment records.\nThe PPI added that once the state system was reformed the government should look at options to overhaul private and workplace pensions. The think tank's proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the Pensions Commission's initial report into UK retirement savings. According to the Pensions Commission's report 12 million working people are not saving enough for their retirement. As a result, living standards could fall for the next generation of UK pensioners. The report added that a combination of higher taxes, higher savings and/or a higher average retirement age was needed to solve the UK pension crisis.",
    "Scarlets and USA Eagles forward Dave Hodges has ended his playing career to pursue a coaching role in the States.\nThe 36-year-old, who has 54 caps, was Llanelli's player of the season in 2001/2, but has battled injury for the last two of his seven years at Stradey. He tore a pectoral muscle against the Ospreys on Boxing Day, an injury that would have kept him out for the season. \"Realising I would be unable to play this season, the club and I agreed to end my contract early,\" said Hodges.\n\"It allows me to move back to the US and pursue opportunities there and allows the Scarlets to look to the next generation.\" The Scarlets have begun to rebuild their squad for next season after a disappointing Heineken Cup campaign, with plenty more signings and departures expected in the coming weeks.\nScarlets chief executive Stuart Gallacher confirmed that 17 of the current squad would be out of contract in the summer. \"We have a deliberate policy whereby around half the squad are coming out of contract and they know they won't all be re-signed, it's a chance to invigorate the squad,\" he said. \"I'm positive about the future of the Scarlets both on and off the field.\" Gallacher was keen to pay tribute to the role back-five forward Hodges has played at Stradey Park, though. \"David has been a highly influential member of our squad for seven years,\" said Gallacher. \"He is a real professional and we thank him for the part he has played in our success. \"I am sure he has an enormous contribution to make to the development of rugby in the US and we wish him and his family well.\" Hodges described his years at Stradey as \"the best time of my life.\"",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "The European Commission has officially launched an in-depth investigation into whether Italian airline Alitalia is receiving illegal state aid.\nCommission officials are to look at Rome's provision of a 400m euro ($495m; £275m) loan to the carrier. Both the Italian government and Alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid. The investigation could take up to 18 months. However, Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot said he wanted it to be carried out as swiftly as possible. \"The Italian authorities have presented a serious industrial plan,\" said Mr Barot. \"We now have to verify certain aspects to confirm that this plan contains no state aid. I would like our analysis to be completed swiftly.\"\nThe matter of possible state aid was brought to the Commission's attention by eight of Alitalia's rivals, including Germany's Lufthansa, British Airways and Spain's Iberia. While Alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability, the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition. Alitalia lost 330m euros in 2003 as it struggled to get to grips with high costs, spiralling oil prices, competition from budget carriers and reduced demand. It plans to split into AZ Fly and AZ Services, which will handle air and ground services respectively. Alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997. EU rules prevent that from happening again in what is known as the \"one time, last time\" rule for airlines. Otherwise, EU regulations on state aid stipulate that governments may help companies financially, but only on the same terms as a commercial investor. The airline declined to comment on the Commission decision.",
    "Apple has expanded its iPod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players.\nIts latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an iPod mini model which can hold 6GB compared to a previous 4GB. The company, which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market, also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped. A 30GB version has also been added to the iPod Photo family. The latest models have a longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of £40. The original iPod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design.\nDuring 2004 about 25 million portable players were sold, 10 million of which were Apple iPods. But analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the iTunes online store, which has given the company a 70% share of the legal download music market. Mike McGuire, a research director at analyst Gartner, told the BBC News website that Apple had done a good job in \"sealing off the market from competition\" so far. \"They have created a very seamless package which I think is the idea of the product - the design, function and the software are very impressive,\" he said. He added that the threat from others was always present, however. \"Creative, other Microsoft-partnered devices, Real, Sony and so on, are ratcheting up the marketing message and advertising,\" he said. Creative was very upbeat about how many of its Creative Zen players it had shipped by the end of last year, he said. Its second-generation models, like the Creative Zen Micro Photo, is due out in the summer. It will have 5GB of memory on board.\nDigital music players are now the gadget of choice among young Americans, according to recent research by the Pew Internet and American Life Project. One in 10 US adults - 22 million people - now owns a digital music player of some sort. Sales of legally downloaded songs also rose more than tenfold in 2004, according to the record industry, with 200 million tracks bought online in the US and Europe in 12 months. The IFPI industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth. Analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players.\nPeople are also starting to use them in novel ways. Some are combining automatic syncing functions many of them have with other net functions to automatically distribute DIY radio shows, called podcasts. But 2005 will also see more competition from mobile phone operators who are keen to offer streaming services on much more powerful and sophisticated handsets. According to Mr McGuire, research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music, which they can do with high-capacity storage devices, like iPods and Creative Zens. Mobiles do not yet have this capacity though, and there are issues about the ease of portability of mobile music. Mr McGuire said Apple was ensuring it kept a foot in the mobile music door with its recent deal with Motorola to produce a version of iTunes for Motorola phones.",
    "Wales centre Sonny Parker and number eight Ryan Jones will miss Saturday's game with Italy because of injury.\nParker has not recovered from a trapped nerve in his neck that kept him out of the win over England, and Tom Shanklin is expected to continue at centre. Jones damaged his collar bone after coming on as a replacement against England and joins flanker Colin Charvis (foot injury) on the sidelines. Meanwhile, Mike Ruddock may make Gavin Henson his first-choice kicker in Rome. The centre was Wales' hero in the 11-9 Six Nations win over England, landing a huge late penalty from wide out to clinch the game. First-choice kicker Stephen Jones handed over responsibility because of Henson's greater kicking range, but the fly-half had already missed a number of shots at goal. \"Our first aim was to get Gavin settled into the team, but giving him the kicks is something we'll talk about in selection this week,\" Wales coach Mike Ruddock told BBC Sport Wales. Henson himself says he is relishing all the media hype that has been heaped on him since last Saturday's game. \"I thrive on it and think it makes me perform better,\" he said. \"I'm glad it's a short week before the Italy game. There was so much build-up before England, but we fly out to Rome on Thursday and we'll be back playing again.\"",
    "Claudio Ranieri has been sacked as Valencia coach just eight months after taking charge at the Primera Liga club for the second time in his career.\nThe decision was taken at a board meeting following the side's surprise elimination from the Uefa Cup. \"We understand, and he understands, that the results in the last few weeks have not been the most appropriate,\" said club president Juan Bautista. Former assistant Antonio Lopez will take over as the new coach. Italian Ranieri took over the Valencia job in June 2004 having been replaced at Chelsea by Jose Mourinho.\nThings began well but the Spanish champions extended their winless streak to six after losing to Racing Santander last weekend. That defeat was then followed by a Uefa Cup exit at the hands of Steaua Bucharest. Ranieri first took charge of Valencia in 1997, guiding them to the King's Cup and helping them to qualify for the Champions League. The 54-year-old then moved to Atletico Madrid in 1999, before joining Chelsea the following year.",
    "Brewing giant Inbev has agreed to buy Alfa-Eco's stake in Sun Interbrew, Russia's second-largest brewer, for up to 259.7m euros ($353.3m; £183.75m).\nAlfa-Eco, the venture capital arm of Russian conglomerate Alfa Group, has a one-fifth stake in Sun Interbrew. The deal gives Inbev, the world's biggest beermaker, near-total control over the Russian brewer. Inbev bought out another partner in August 2004. Inbev brands include Bass, Stella Artois, Hoegaarden and Staropramen. It employs 77,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.\nThe Leuven-based brewery said it would own 97.3% of the voting shares and 98.8% of the non-voting shares of Sun Interbrew. The deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005. Inbev was formed in August 2004 when Belgium's Interbrew bought Brazilian brewer Ambev. Sun Interbrew, which employs 8,000 staff, owns breweries in eight Russian cities - Klin, Ivanovo, Saransk, Kursk, Volzhsky, Omsk, Perm and Novocheboksarsk. There are also three breweries in Ukraine, in the cities of Chernigov, Nikolaev and Kharkov.",
    "For the umpteenth time, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are said to have declared all out war on each other.\nThis time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government's global aid and debt initiatives, particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things. It dominated the prime minister's monthly news conference, which saw Mr Blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour. As he told journalists: \"I am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers. There is a complete unity of purpose.\" And he again heaped praise on Mr Brown saying he was doing a great job, and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for Mr Brown after the election.\nSo why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with Mr Brown's long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt, he was asked? By now Mr Blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. He snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference. Well, not really, as it happens.\nAnd he repeated what a great man Gordon was and how united they were, before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers, preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world. Although in the next breath he declared: \"I get increasingly alarmed by what I read in the newspapers\" before catching himself on and quickly adding: \"In so far as I read them of course.\" He probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men.\nAs far as the timing of the prime minister's press conference is concerned, there are two options. The first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment. If that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling. The second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence, which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements - through the infamous Downing Street grid - to avert just such allegations.\nEither way, the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue. And there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men. Firstly, the prime minister insisted on Wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get G8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries. It was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that Gordon Brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government's response to the disaster while Mr Blair was still on holiday in Egypt.\nThen, as if to pour fuel on the flames, both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, Aid minister Hilary Benn and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott - without mentioning the other. All this came amid fresh claims that Mr Brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had, as a result, started to set out his own platform. The fact that he used an article in the Guardian newspaper to set out what he believed \"should\" be in the manifesto, has embarked on a mini tour of Britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit Africa on the same mission - often seen as the prime minister's \"turf\" - has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other. The prime minister denied all that as well, repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign. But the big fear with many on the Labour benches now is that, unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry, it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself.",
    "England's Josh Lewsey has claimed he was denied a late try in his side's Six Nations loss to Ireland.\nThe Wasps wing insisted he grounded the ball when he was bundled over the line and said referee Jonathan Kaplan had made a wrong decision. \"I'm positive I touched the ball down over the line,\" Lewsey told BBC Sport. \"It certainly wasn't a turnover. \"I was driven over and I put the ball on the ground. The whistle went and I let go of the ball.\" Lewsey added: \"One of the Irish players scooped it back after the whistle and to our surprise the referee then gave a turnover. \"As far as I'm concerned, that incident and Mark Cueto's effort from Charlie Hodgson's cross-field kick that led to what looked like a good try were the two key elements in the game.\"\nCueto was also puzzled as to why his try had been disallowed by Kaplan. \"I don't think I could have been offside for, without a doubt, I was behind the ball,\" said the Sale player. \"The move was a planned technique, it was not off the cuff. We rehearse it time and time again. \"I wouldn't say we were robbed, some decisions go with you and some go against you. Today they went against us and that's tough at international level.\"",
    "Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was \"out of control\" during the \"wild\" 1960s.\nLucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as \"Precious\" at school. Despite being told he was a \"nutter who died at sea\" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound found out about it last year. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.\nMr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: \"I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead.\" He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a \"set-up\" but he then realised all the dates fitted. \"It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,\" said the Ealing North MP. \"I don't blame Lucy's mother. I was pretty much out of control. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.\"\nMr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since. Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: \"The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. \"We were finishing each other sentences.\" Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.",
    "Actor Tom Hanks and director Ron Howard are reuniting for The Da Vinci Code, an adaptation of the international best-selling novel by Dan Brown.\nDistributor Sony Pictures said production will begin next year, with a planned release in May 2006. Hanks will play Robert Langdon, who is trying to solve the murder of a member of an ancient society that has protected dark secrets for centuries. It will be Hanks' third collaboration with Howard. They previously worked together, along with Howard's producing partner Brian Grazer, on Splash and Apollo 13.\nHanks is one of Hollywood's most bankable stars, with his presence in a movie almost guaranteeing box office success. Brown's book has become a publishing phenomenon, consistently topping book charts in the UK and US. It has sold more than eight million copies worldwide in little over two years. It is a classic whodunit, which centres on a global conspiracy surrounding the Holy Grail mythology and places heavy emphasis on symbols and cryptography. Its protagonist is a Harvard professor likened to a contemporary Indiana Jones, who also appeared in Brown's first book Angels and Demons. The tale mixes art history with mythology, semiotics with medieval history.",
    "The Brazilian stock market has risen to a record high as investors display growing confidence in the durability of the country's economic recovery.\nThe main Bovespa index on the Sao Paolo Stock Exchange closed at 24,997 points on Friday, topping the previous record market close reached the previous day. The market's buoyancy reflects optimism about the Brazilian economy, which could grow by as much as 4.5% in 2004. Brazil is recovering from last year's recession - its worst in a decade.\nEconomic output declined 0.2% in 2003 and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva - elected as Brazil's first working-class president in 2002 - was strongly criticised for pursuing a hardline economic policy.\nInvestors have praised his handling of the economy as foreign investment has risen, unemployment has fallen and inflation has been brought under control. Analysts believe the stock market will rise above the 25,000 mark for the first time before too long. \"There should be more space for gains until the end of the year, somewhere up to 27,000 points,\" said Paschoal Tadeu Buonomo, head of equities trading at brokers TOV. Brazil's currency, the real, also rose to its highest level against the dollar in more than two years on Friday. Although interest rates still stand at a punitive 17.25%, inflation has fallen from 9% to 7% while exports are booming, particularly of agricultural products. \"For the first time in decades, we have all three economic policy pillars in line during a recovery,\" Finance Minister Antonio Palocci told the Associated Press news agency. \"Government accounts are in surplus, we have a current account surplus and inflation is under control.\"\nInvestors were deeply suspicious of President da Silva, a former trade union leader who campaigned on a programme of extensive land redistribution and a large rise in the minimum wage. However, Mr da Silva has stuck to an orthodox monetary policy inherited from his predecessor even in the face of last year's economic crisis. This has earned him the disapproval of rural farm workers, thousands of whom who took to the streets of Brasilia on Thursday to protest against government policies. President da Silva has defended his policies, arguing that Brazil cannot afford to continue the cycle of boom and bust which afflicted it in recent decades.",
    "Top seed Roger Federer had to save two match points before squeezing past Juan Carlos Ferrero at the Dubai Open.\nThe world number one took two hours 15 minutes to earn his 4-6 6-3 7-6 victory, saving match points at 6-4 in the tiebreak before claiming it 8-6. Federer made a number of unforced errors early on, allowing Ferrero to take advantage and claim the first set. But the Swiss star hit back to reach the quarter-finals, where he will face seventh seed Russian Mikhail Youzhny. The Russian beat Germany's Rainer Schuettler 7-5 6-4. Federer was not unduly worried despite being taken to three sets for the third consecutive match. The world number one was forced to go the distance against Ivan Ljubicic in the Rotterdam final and against Ivo Minar in the first round in Dubai. \"I definitely had a slow start again and to come back every time is quite an effort,\" he said. \"I haven't been playing well, but I've been coming through. I'm winning the crucial points and that shows I'm on top of my game when I have to be.\"",
    "Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has played down reports that Arjen Robben will return for the Champions League match against Barcelona.\n\"He's been responding well to treatment and started running on Friday, but we'll have to wait and see,\" he told BBC Five Live's Sportsweek. \"We're looking to getting him back as soon as possible, but he'll be back when it's right for him and for us. \"There's no plans at the moment around the Barcelona game.\" His comments contradict those of chiropractor Jean Pierre Meersseman who treated the Dutchman after he fractured his foot at the start of February. Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March. \"I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen,\" Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday. \"I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago. It was an obvious correction and easy to perform. \"I know he was pleased with what I did and now that he is running again. I am due to see him one more time again in the next few days.\" Meersseman is the medical co-ordinator at Italian side AC Milan.",
    "Late R&B star Aaliyah's record company has failed in an attempt to sue the video producer who booked the ill-fated flight on which she died in 2001.\nA New York appeals court has told Blackground Records that only the singer's parents had the right to launch a claim for wrongful death. The 22-year-old singer's family came to an undisclosed settlement over a negligence claim in 2003. Aaliyah had completed a music video when the plane crashed in the Bahamas. She and eight others were killed on the plane, which crashed as if left for Florida. Blackground Records' lawyer Frank Penski said he had yet to examine the decision and did not know whether they would pursue the case.\nAn investigation into the crash revealed the twin-engined Cessna was overloaded by 700 pounds (320kg). A post-mortem carried out on the remains of the pilot showed there was cocaine and alcohol in his body. Aaliyah was a rising star in music and film before she was killed. She was honoured with a string of posthumous awards and her single More Than A Woman went to number one in the UK.",
    "Rapper 50 Cent has ended his public feud with his protege The Game as the pair said they wanted to be good role models for their communities.\nThe row blew up when 50 Cent threw The Game out of his G-Unit crew and accused him of being disloyal. A member of The Game's entourage was reportedly shot outside a radio station where 50 Cent was being interviewed. But the pair shook hands as they handed over money to music projects for New York's deprived areas on Wednesday.\nThe Game, whose real name is Jayceon Taylor, told a news conference: \"I want to apologise. I'm almost ashamed to have participated in the things that went on over the last few weeks.\" Chart-topper 50 Cent, real name Curtis Jackson, said the truce came on the anniversary of the death of the Notorious BIG in 1997, who was part of a volatile feud between the east and west coast rap scenes. \"We're here today to show that people can rise above the most difficult circumstances and together we can put negativity behind us,\" 50 Cent said.\n\"A lot of people don't want to see it happen, but we're responding to the two most important groups - our family and our fans.\" The Boys Choir of Harlem got a cheque for $150,000 (£77,800) from 50 Cent, while The Game handed over $103,500 (£53,400). The Game also made a contribution to the Compton schools music programme. 50 Cent announced he has launched the G-Unity Foundation \"to help people overcome obstacles and make a chance for the better in their lives\".\n\"I realised that if I'm going to be effective at that, I have to overcome some of my own,\" he said. \"Game and I need to set an example in the community.\" 50 Cent is no stranger to feuds, with rapper Ja Rule among the targets for ridicule in his songs. On his latest album, released earlier this month, he turned his attentions to Fat Joe and Nas, who have both worked with Ja Rule. Both he and The Game have admitted drug dealing in the past and have both been shot.",
    "British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.\nThe Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. Another 7% said they would not vote at all. The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006. The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.\nBallot papers in the poll will ask: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?\" The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.\nThe treaty was signed by all 25 current EU members in Rome last October and is due to come into force in November 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote. Meanwhile, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\".",
    "South Africa biggest retail bank Absa has said it is still in talks with UK bank Barclays over the sale of majority stake in the group.\nIn November, Absa said it was close to striking a deal with Barclays. But the group said Barclays is still waiting for the approval of South Africa's banking and competition authorities to make a formal offer. Absa also announced that it expects to see earnings grow by 20-25% in its current financial year.\n\"Discussions with Barclays are continuing, but shareholders are advised that no agreement has been reached as to any offer being made by Barclays to acquire a majority stake in Absa,\" Absa said in a statement. If Barclays buys a stake in Absa it will be one of the largest foreign investments in South Africa in recent years. Absa currently has a market value of about $8.5bn (£4.4bn). Analysts said Absa's earnings forecast was better than expected. However, the company warned that headline earnings growth would be trimmed by about four percentage points because of share options for a black economic empowerment transaction and a staff share incentive scheme. The South African group will release its results for the year to 31 March on 30 May.",
    "Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has said he will not tolerate attacks such as last Friday's suicide bombing in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.\nIn an interview ahead of a meeting in London to discuss Palestinian reforms, Mr Abbas said such attacks were against Palestinian interests. The Palestinian Authority (PA) was exerting \"a 100% effort\" to end the violence, Mr Abbas added. The attack, which killed five, was the first of its kind since he took office. Mr Abbas confirmed Israel shared information with the PA in the hunt for the organisers of the attack. The Israeli government refuses to accept Syria's denials that it was implicated in the nightclub bombing. Israeli officials gave an intelligence briefing to foreign ambassadors on Monday, explaining Syria's alleged involvement. British foreign minister Jack Straw said there had been a \"continuing stream\" of information suggesting Palestinian militant groups were operating from within Syria.\nIn an email interview in the British newspaper the Independent, Mr Abbas said: \"We believe peace is possible now and we are ready to negotiate with Israel to reach a true and lasting peace based on justice and international legitimacy.\" He added: \"We have an opportunity and it would be irresponsible if we, the Israelis, or the world allow it to slip away.\" Tuesday's meeting on Palestinian reform is being hosted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Also due to attend are US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, World Bank officials and foreign ministers from 23 European and Arab countries. The conference was a \"vital step\" in renewing the peace process, Mr Straw said. \"It's a high-level attendance, which reflects the sense of momentum and opportunity created by recent events,\" he added. A spokesman for Mr Blair said the Prime Minister expected the conference to discuss \"a comprehensive, co-ordinated and, above all, practical work plan for both the Palestinian Authority and the international community\". Israel will not attend, but is said to be closely watching the outcome.",
    "Hunts in England and Wales have begun on the last day that hunting with dogs is legal, with more due out later.\nThousands of supporters are expected to turn out at more than 250 meets, many of which have altered their normal schedules to be out on a Thursday. The ban on hunting with dogs comes into effect from 0001 GMT on Friday. The Countryside Alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on Wednesday when the Appeal Court ruled the Hunting Act was lawful.\nBut the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in, with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits. Others are expected to defy the ban by continuing to hunt illegally.\nAnti-hunt organisations, for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning, say they hope most will stay within the law. Mike Hobday, of the League Against Cruel Sports, told BBC News: \"We've long urged them to go drag hunting - to follow an artificial scent - and that is what we hope they do. \"But if they continue to chase foxes, to chase wild mammals around the countryside, that's against the law and we're confident they'll be brought to justice.\" At the headquarters of Quorn hunt in Leicestershire, feelings were running high as hunt enthusiasts prepared for their final legal hunt. BBC correspondent Sarah Mukherjee said hunt supporters were in tears.\nShe said many people did not share the Countryside Alliance's optimism that hunting would be able to continue. Farmer Geoff Brooks, a senior member of the Quorn hunt, told BBC News people's lives \"revolved around hunting\". He described the ban as \"ridiculous\" and \"badly thought out\" but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record.\nAt the Court of Appeal on Wednesday, the Countryside Alliance failed in its attempt to have the Hunting Act ruled invalid. But it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police.\nThe alliance says hunt supporters will go out and test this law to its limits on Saturday. The League Against Cruel Sports and the RSPCA say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions. The Association of Chief Police Officers has issued guidance to forces on how to deal with the new rules. A spokesman said: \"Basically, it's not going to be police officers chasing about in cars across fields, it will be based on intelligence and information received as well.\" The decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces, with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected. He said police would consider evidence submitted by anti-hunt organisations on its merits.",
    "Shares in UK drinks and food firm Allied Domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by France's Pernod Ricard.\nReports in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times suggested that the French spirits firm is considering a bid, but has yet to contact its target. Allied Domecq shares in London rose 4% by 1200 GMT, while Pernod shares in Paris slipped 1.2%. Pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics.\nPernod's last major purchase was a third of US giant Seagram in 2000, the move which propelled it into the global top three of drinks firms. The other two-thirds of Seagram was bought by market leader Diageo. In terms of market value, Pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than Allied Domecq, which has a capitalisation of £5.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros). Last year Pernod tried to buy Glenmorangie, one of Scotland's premier whisky firms, but lost out to luxury goods firm LVMH. Pernod is home to brands including Chivas Regal Scotch whisky, Havana Club rum and Jacob's Creek wine. Allied Domecq's big names include Malibu rum, Courvoisier brandy, Stolichnaya vodka and Ballantine's whisky - as well as snack food chains such as Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins ice cream. The WSJ said that the two were ripe for consolidation, having each dealt with problematic parts of their portfolio. Pernod has reduced the debt it took on to fund the Seagram purchase to just 1.8bn euros, while Allied has improved the performance of its fast-food chains.",
    "All four contestants still remain in I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here as no evictions were made on the television show on Saturday.\nContestants Paul Burrell, Joe Pasquale, Janet Street-Porter and Fran Cosgrave were told by hosts Ant and Dec. Natalie Appleton's decision to quit the show last Monday had given them all a stay of execution, the group were told. Model Sophie Anderton was the last person to be voted off the ITV1 show, set in the Australian jungle. The four remaining stars will do a joint Bushtucker Trial on Sunday.\nFormer All Saints singer Natalie Appleton,31, walked out of the show after learning she would face a fifth so-called Bushtucker Trial. The celebrities are chosen by the viewers to pass trials in order to win food for the rest of the camp. Appleton had endured a torrid time during the programme, including a well-publicised row with Sophie Anderton. And on 26 November singer Brian Harvey quit as a contestant after he had a blazing row with Janet Street-Porter.",
    "A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned.\nThe Internationalised Domain Names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the Internet Engineering Task Force. But the UK Internet Forum (UKIF) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. The problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language.\nRegistering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF. Domain names are the \"real language\" addresses of websites, rather than their internet protocol address, which is a series of numbers. They are used so people can more easily navigate the web. So-called ASCII codes are used to represent European languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called Unicode is used. So, for example, website PayPal could now be coded using a mixture of the Latin alphabet and the Russian alphabet. The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'. But the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. This is more than just a theory. A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system, said Mr Dyer. As the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to Paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, Mr Dyer said. \"Although the IDN problem is well known in technical circles, the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked,\" said Mr Dyer.\n\"It is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site,\" he added. There are solutions. For instance, browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. Mr Dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. Another solution, to introduce IDN-disabled browsers could be a case of \"throwing out the baby with the bath water,\" he said. CENTR, the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries, agrees. \"A rush to introduce IDN-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in IDNs - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-English speaking world,\" the organisation said in a statement.",

    "Banned American sprinter Kelli White says she knowingly took steroids given to her by Bay Area Lab Co-Operative (Balco) president Victor Conte.\nConte faces a federal trial next year on charges of distributing steroids and tax evasion, and White said at first he tried to cover up what he was doing. \"He's the one who told me that it wasn't what he said it was,\" White said in the San Francisco Chronicle. But she added: \"It was my decision to go to him, not anybody else's.\" White said Conte at first told her the substance was flaxseed oil, only to change his story later. White failed a drugs test after winning the 100m and 200m titles at the 2003 world athletics championships. She was subsequently handed a two-year ban in May this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil. At first, White claimed she took the drug to combat narcolepsy but she now takes full responsibility for her actions.\n\"My whole belief about Victor is that he was selling a product,\" White said in the LA Times. \"Whether it be a good product or a bad product, he was selling a product.\" White was introduced to Conte through her coach Remy Korchemy, who is also a defendant in the Balco case. The 27-year-old believes doping is so common in sport she felt compelled to cheat herself if she was to have any chance of winning. \"I have no clue what it's going to take to change that,\" said White. \"I would say I made a mistake and I would never, ever go back. \"I would never recommend anyone to take that route.\"",
    "Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand, who shot to prominence in 2004, have won two Brit Awards.\nWith their self-titled debut, Franz Ferdinand have achieved what most rock bands crave - high credibility and critical acclaim while also selling stacks of CDs. They have risen to the head of the UK's art rock ranks with an album of songs that are catchy, creative and original enough to sound fresh. With a cool, spiky, fun sound previously associated with bands like Talking Heads, they hit upon a style that had been out of fashion for a while and so was ripe for another airing. Their first UK single hit number three last January, followed by two more top 20 hits, while the album has sold more than 600,000 copies in 11 months on release. In September it was named album of the year winning the prestigious Mercury Music Prize.\nOn the festivals circuit, they have been one of the main attractions for huge crowds at Glastonbury, T in the Park and Reading/Leeds. They have also found success in Japan, Europe and the US. By September the album had sold 500,000 in the States and total sales were pushing two million worldwide. They have been nominated for three Grammy awards in the US as well as the US music industry's Shortlist award, but lost the Shortlist prize to US band TV on the Radio. Nevertheless Franz Ferdinand were the only UK band to win an MTV Video Music Award this year, taking the breakthrough video crown for Take Me Out.\nThe four-piece met two years ago when drummer Paul Thomson was working at the Glasgow art school where bassist Bob Hardy was studying. Singer Alex Kapranos was studying English at university but had friends at art school, and the line-up was completed when guitarist Nick McCarthy moved from Munich, Germany, to the city. At the turn of the year, Kapranos told BBC News Online the band were fed up with serious bands in \"that post-rock thing that seemed to be doing its damndest to avoid any bloody tune\".\n\"We want people to go away from the gigs humming the tunes that we were singing. But at the same time bringing an edge to it.\" Franz Ferdinand had a question they asked themselves every time they wrote a song, Kapranos said. \"Where's the fun in that?\" they pondered at every stage, making enjoyment the top priority and ensuring they did not disappear up their own muso posteriors. The band started out with a DIY ethic that saw them take over a disused art-deco warehouse in Glasgow and rename it The Chateau. The venue soon became legendary - so well-known that the police spent a month trying to find it, eventually raiding it and arresting Kapranos. But the charges of running an illegal bar and contravening health and safety, fire hazard and noise abatement laws were dropped.\nThe band took over an abandoned Victorian courtroom and jail instead, and named that The Chateau. The buzz about the band soon spread around the music industry and 40 record labels turned up to one gig in Glasgow - which the band thought was \"totally ridiculous\". \"I'm really glad it was almost comical because we weren't overwhelmed by the seriousness of it,\" Kapranos said. They signed with independent label Domino, home of Smog, Sebadoh and Four Tet, in June 2003.",
    "Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that allowing huge US budget deficits to continue could have \"severe\" consequences.\nSpeaking to the House Budget Committee he urged Congress to take action to cut the deficit, such as increasing taxes. While the US economy is growing at a \"reasonably good pace\" he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the US. Pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy, he said.\nThe government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby-boom generation retires. \"I fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver. If existing promises need to be changed, those changes should be made sooner rather than later,\" Mr Greenspan said. He also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity \"retirement and health programmes would need \"significant\" changes. He called on Congress to cut promised benefits for retirees, as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford.\nMeanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added. He also urged Congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the US heading further into the red. Despite the dire warnings, Mr Greenspan did offer some good news for the short term. As US growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit. Recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely, which should cut some costs. Since President George W Bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of $412bn last year.",
    "A slump in profitability at luxury car maker Mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent DaimlerChrysler.\nThe German-US carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros ($1bn) from 2.4bn euros in 2003. Mercedes-Benz's woes - its profits slid to just 20m euros - obscured a strong performance from the Chrysler group whose returns met market expectations. Mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from BMW and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006.\nMercedes' profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003's 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros. For the year as a whole, its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros. Sales of Mercedes' brands fell 2% as demand cooled, while revenues were affected by the weakness of the US dollar.\nThe carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its Mercedes Smart mini-car range. Mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros, having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with German workers last year. The firm said it was determined to retain Mercedes' position as the world's most successful luxury brand. However, DaimlerChrysler's shares fell 1.5% on the news. \"While all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround Mercedes-Benz,\" Michael Rabb, an analyst with Bank Sal Oppenheim, told Reuters.\nIn contrast, Chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues - calculated in US dollars - rose 10%. The US division - whose marques include Dodge and Jeep - transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1.4bn euros profit last year.\nOverall, DaimlerChrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4.7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros. Chrysler's strong performance helped the world's fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros.\n\"The year 2004 shows that our strategy works well - even in such a challenging competitive environment,\" said Jurgen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman. DaimlerChrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture, Japanese subsidiary Fuso. DaimlerChrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner Mitsubishi Motors which will see it buy out its stake in Fuso. Looking forward, DaimerChrysler's profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005. However, it is expecting \"significant improvements\" in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the Mercedes product range.",
    "Angolan families who are attempting to track each other down, after being separated by nearly 30 years of war, are succeeding thanks to a hugely popular TV show.\nMeeting Point has become one of TV Angola's most watched programmes, and has reunited hundreds of families. It runs daily, not only on the television but also on the radio. Every Friday, hundreds of people gather in Luanda's Independence Square to record a message in front of the TV cameras, in the hope that a lost relative will see it. Many relatives have been reunited on air. \"At the beginning there was an absolute explosion - huge, huge crowds,\" Sergio Gera, the programme's chief co-ordinator, told BBC World Service's Assignment programme. \"Now things are a little calmer, there are slightly less people - but, after two and a half years of broadcasting, there are still a lot of people going.\"\nThe media in the southern African country, twice the size of France, has been gripped by the quest of so many people to find their relatives. Hundreds of thousands of people died in Angola's 30-year civil war, which finally ended in 2002, and tens of thousands of people are still missing. Many have not heard anything for 10 or more years - in all, 90% of Angolan families have lost someone.\nThe idea of recording in Independence Square was modelled on a square in the Argentine capital Buenos Aries, where mothers go to talk about the dead and the missing, and to exchange news. One woman, Victoria Lapete, found her sister - the only remaining member of her family - in Independence Square live on Meeting Point. She had not seen her sibling for 28 years. \"When we saw each other, we threw ourselves into each other's arms,\" she told Assignment. \"We started to cry. I felt very, very happy, because I'd spent so long without any family. Suddenly I had a sister again.\" However, Angola is one of the poorest countries in Africa, and the number of people with access to either a television or radio is comparatively few. This means that elsewhere in the country, the task of reuniting families lies primarily with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). In the city of Wambo, the ICRC runs the Gazetta - a 200-page, tabloid-size book which contains 13,000 names of missing or displaced.\nTheir task is made much harder by the huge number of landmines dotted around the country. \"It's very difficult - there are many displaced,\" stated Joaquim Sahundi, head of tracing in Wambo.\n\"As they try to go back [home], others are trying to relocate their relatives. Many people are getting injured because of that - in the villages, in the bush, there has been no clearance of mines. \"When people are crossing these areas, they step on mines.\" The ICRC also uses the media where it can, running four daily broadcasts of their lists of the missing on Radio Angola. Meanwhile, there remain massive challenges to Angolan families even once they are reunited. \"The programme of family reunification is extremely important, but for these families to remain reunified, there has to be social integration, job access, education, healthcare,\" said Rafael Marques of the pro-democracy George Soros Foundation for Southern Africa. \"Essentially the government is waiting for the international community to pay for the reconstruction - that's why it has been persistently calling for a donor's conference. That is just a way of detaching itself from its political responsibilities.\"",
    "Church ministers are trying to prevent rapper Nelly performing in Arkansas, saying they do not want his \"vile and filthy lyrics\" in their town.\nMore than 20 Jonesboro ministers urged music fans to boycott Nelly's 12 March concert at Arkansas State University in a bid to have it cancelled. \"Jonesboro is a wonderful city because of what does not come here,\" said the Reverend Adrian Rodgers. But a venue spokesman said more than 5,500 tickets had been sold so far.\nMr Rodgers, of the Fullness of Joy Church, said he was concerned about the rapper's lyrics that include references to drugs, sex and violence, and songs that the minister said were demeaning to women. Ministers were worried that bringing such acts to Jonesboro would lead to problems. \"Tear the tickets up,\" Mr Rodgers said. \"Do not go and do not allow your children to go.\"\nTim Dean, director of the Arkansas State University venue, said ticket sales had been brisk. \"It would appear that with ticket sales over 5,000, many others have expressed their right to find Nelly's music entertaining and worth spending their time and money on,\" he said. Nelly has sold more than 30 million singles and albums worldwide, and in September 2004 simultaneously occupied the number one and two positions in the US albums chart. He has had 12 UK hit singles, including Hot in Herre, Dilemma and recent number one Over and Over.",
    "Ken Livingstone should \"stick to his guns\" and not apologise for his \"Nazi\" comment to a Jewish reporter, Tory MP Boris Johnson has insisted.\nMr Johnson also claimed Tony Blair's intervention in the row was \"an attempt to reassure Jewish voters\". London mayor Mr Livingstone says he is \"standing by\" his remarks which likened an Evening Standard journalist to a \"concentration camp guard\". But the prime minister says it is time for Mr Livingstone to say sorry.\nLabour's Mr Livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked. Later the prime minister said: \"A lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time, but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a Jewish journalist, yes, he should apologise.\"\nHowever, Mr Johnson, who was forced to apologise last year for an article in the magazine he edits about Liverpudlians grieving over the death of British hostage Ken Bigley, said Mr Blair \"should butt out of\" the row. \"I don't see why the prime minister has to get involved in this,\" The Spectator editor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"It's a dispute between Ken Livingstone and a reporter on the Evening Standard.\" Mr Johnson, MP for Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, said he suspected Labour was now trying to reassure Jewish voters \"because of this curious way in which Labour seems to be trying to curry favour with disillusioned Muslim voters who may be disillusioned about the war\".\n\"Ken doesn't think he's got anything to say sorry for and if that's really his feeling, then I think that he should stick to his guns,\" he said. Mr Johnson apologised last October for perpetuating an \"outdated stereotype\" of Liverpool in the leader article on the death of Mr Bigley. The article in the magazine suggested grieving Liverpudlians were wallowing in their victim status. It also attributed blame to drunken Liverpool football fans for the 1989 Hillsborough disaster in which 96 died. Mr Johnson told Today: \"It's perfectly true that I got into the grovelling game myself and when I apologised there were some things that I felt I ought to say sorry for ... there were also other things I didn't think I should apologise for,\" he said. \"But here's old Ken - he's been crass, he's been insensitive and thuggish and brutal in his language - but I don't think actually if you read what he said, although it was extraordinary and rude, I don't think he was actually anti-Semitic.\"",
    "Choking traffic jams in Beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges.\nCar ownership has risen fast in recent years, and there are now two and a half million cars on the city's roads. The trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, making motorists reluctant to use them. Instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option. \"The price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable,\" said Wang Yan, an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development and Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper. Mr Wang, who is in charge of collecting car parking fees, said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap. Indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones.\nSports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission's road rage. It wants them to use public transport, and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds. Mr Wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches. Indoor parking may be costly, but it is not always secure. Mr Wang's team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan ($48; £26). The Beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries' motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic. Unclogging Beijing's increasingly impassable streets is a major concern for the Chinese authorities, who are building dozens of new roads to create a showcase modern city ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games.",
    "Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\"",
    "A batch of downbeat government data has cast doubt over the French economy's future prospects.\nOfficial figures showed on Friday that unemployment was unchanged at 9.9% last month, while consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in October. At the same time, finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed a threat to French growth. \"[Oil prices] will weigh on consumer spending in the short term, and potentially on confidence,\" he said. World oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand.\nAnalysts said French companies, keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff. \"[The unemployment figures] show the main problem of the French economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment,\" said Marc Touati, an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires. \"Politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms, otherwise in five or ten years, it will be too late.\" Obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in France than in many other European economies. Many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs, and by scrapping restrictions on working hours. The French statistics agency, INSEE, expects the economy to grow by about 2.4% this year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment. That is above the projected eurozone average of just above 2%.",
    "World number one Lindsay Davenport has criticised Wimbledon over the issue of equal prize money for women.\nReacting to a disputed comment by All England Club chairman Tim Phillips, the American said: \"I think it is highly insulting if prize money is taken away. \"Somebody, I think it was Mr Phillips, said they won't have money for flowers at Wimbledon. That's insulting.\" An All England club spokesperson denied Phillips made the remark, insisting: \"He definitely didn't say it.\" The statement added: \"It was said by someone else and was a humorous aside at the end of a radio interview when the conversation had moved to talking about the Wimbledon grounds.\"\nDavenport was speaking following the announcement that this week's Dubai Duty Free event will join the US and Australian Opens in offering equal prize money for women. \"You hear about women playing only three sets while men play five,\" said Daveport. \"And the best women are never going to beat the best men. \"But it's a different game you go to watch with the women - it doesn't make it better or worse. \"Hopefully we will be able to change people's minds.\"\nSerena Williams, who is also in Dubai, added: \"I'm obviously for equal prize money. \"Women's tennis is exciting. Men's tennis is exciting as well, but the women have it right now. \"If you are bringing in the spectators you should be able to reap what everyone else is able to reap.\"",
    "US industrial production increased for the 21st month in a row in February, but at a slower pace than in January, official figures show.\nThe Institute for Supply Management (ISM) index fell to 55.3 in February, from an adjusted 56.4 in January. Although the index was lower than in January, the fact that it held above 50 shows continued growth in the sector. \"February was another good month in the manufacturing sector,\" said ISM survey chairman Norbert Ore.\n\"While the overall rate of growth is slowing, the overall picture is improving as price increases and shortages are becoming less of a problem. Exports and imports remain strong,\" he said. Analysts had expected February's figure to be stronger than January's and come in at 57. Of the 20 manufacturing sectors surveyed by ISM, 13 reported growth. They included the textiles, apparel, tobacco, chemicals and transportation sectors. The ISM's index of national manufacturing activity is compiled from the responses of purchasing executives at more than 400 industrial companies.",
    "Talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.\nFive public sector unions will hold private talks with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead. They want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. Up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 March. However, all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape. In four days, Britain's biggest union Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes. Other public sector unions have pledged to follow. It is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.\nThe five unions meeting Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. This would allow months of tough negotiations to follow, said our correspondent. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April. Privately ministers believe this will be the \"less painful\" option, our correspondent added. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. \"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.\"\nUnison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. It is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.",
    "Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be \"the most accessible browser on the market\", according to its authors.\nThe latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"\nAnother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.\nThe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.",
    "Sir Elton John has performed at a special concert in Paris to raise money for the victims of the Asian tsunami.\nThe British singer played to a 2,700-strong audience on Sunday at the French capital's Bastille opera house. The concert was also part of an attempt to bring a broader range of events to the famous venue. Money raised will go to the Fondation pour l'Enfance (Foundation for Childhood) which aims to rebuild a children's shelter in Sri Lanka. Sir Elton played hits from his vast back catalogue to a sell-out crowd which included former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing and his wife Anne-Aymone. The veteran pop star played piano accompaniment throughout the concert which lasted for three hours without an interval.\nHe told the crowd: \"Throughout the years, I've done a lot of drugs and alcohol. It's true that I was a nightmare, impossible. For the last 14 years I've been normal. Now my drug is called David\" - a reference to David Furnish, his partner. The crowd, who greeted each song with a standing ovation, also included French singer Charles Aznavour and British ambassador Sir John Holmes. Sir Elton has also teamed up with Phil Collins to record a version of Eric Clapton's 1991 hit Tears In Heaven to raise money for the relief fund. A release date has yet to be set for the recording, which was organised by Sharon Osbourne.",
    "Actor Robert Blake had gunshot residue on his hands and clothes the night his wife was shot dead, a court has heard.\nBut it may not have come from the shot that killed Bonny Lee Bakley in 2001, Mr Blake's murder trial was told by criminalist Steven Dowell. Mr Dowell told a Los Angeles court the residue may have come from Mr Blake's revolver, his gun collection, his presence at the crime scene or police. The 71-year-old former star of US TV drama Baretta has denied murder. Mr Blake said he found Ms Bakley, 44, dead in a car after they left a restaurant.\nHe said he briefly returned to the restaurant to collect a gun he had left behind and discovered her body when he returned. The gun he collected was not the murder weapon. It could also have been picked up if he touched or leant on the car when he found the body, or from a police box in which his clothes were later stored. The box had come from an area where officers went after being on the firing range. But Mr Dowell also said the residue would have been present if Mr Blake fired a gun that night. Witnesses have already told the trial Mr Blake \"stood out as being quite nervous and agitated\" at the restaurant before the murder. The actor, who won an Emmy for playing a maverick detective in the 1970s TV cop drama Baretta, could face life in prison if convicted.",
    "Nintendo is releasing an adapter for its DS handheld console so it can play music and video.\nThe add-on for the DS means people can download TV programmes, film clips or MP3 files to the adaptor and then play them back while on the move. The release of the media add-on is an attempt by the Japanese games giant to protect its dominance of the handheld gaming market. Nintendo said the media adapter will be available from February in Japan.\nThe Nintendo DS is the successor to the hugely successful GameBoy handheld game console and went on sale in Japan on 2 December. The DS has two screens, one of which is touch sensitive, and also has on-board a short-range wireless link that lets people play against each other.\nThe launch of the media adapter, and the attempt to broaden the appeal of the device, is widely seen as a response to the unveiling of the Sony PSP which was built as a multi-purpose media player and game gadget from the start. Sony is thought to be preparing pre-packaged movies and music for the PSP. The add-on will also work with the GameBoy Advance SP. Nintendo dominates the handheld gaming console world thanks to successive versions of the GameBoy. More than 28 million GameBoy Advance handhelds have been sold around the world. The dual-screen DS is also thought to be selling well with more than 2.5 million expected to be sold by the end of 2004. Nintendo said it had no plans to sell the media adapter outside Japan. When it goes on sale the adapter is expected to cost about 5000 yen (£25), roughly the difference in price between the DS and the higher-priced Sony PSP.",
    "Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has insisted that Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger would swap places with him.\nMourinho's side were knocked out of the FA Cup by Newcastle last Sunday before seeing Barcelona secure a 2-1 Champions League first-leg lead in the Nou Camp. But he denied his club was suffering a dip in form which league rivals Arsenal and Manchester United could exploit. \"They cannot speak to us about blips because they're not in a better position than us,\" Mourinho said. \"Do they want to change positions with us? We are top of the league by nine points and in the Carling Cup final. \"The only thing they can say they are in a better position than us in is the FA Cup. \"In the Champions League all three teams can either go through or go out but the one team that is in the best position is still Chelsea.\"\nMourinho said it was important to keep his team's results in perspective. \"Don't try to put pressure on me because I am never under pressure,\" he warned. \"We have lost one important game this week - at Newcastle - and we're out of the FA Cup but I don't think a defeat in a first-leg tie is a real defeat.

    "Employers have spent billions of pounds propping up their final salary pensions over the past year, research suggests.\nA survey of 280 schemes by Incomes Data Services' (IDS) said employer contributions had increased from £5.5bn to £8.2bn a year, a rise of 49.7%. Companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by 100% or more, IDS said. Many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open, because of rising costs and increased liabilities. A final salary scheme, also known as a defined benefit scheme, promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire.\nThe rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase, or defined contribution, schemes. These are less risky for employers. Under money purchase schemes, employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity - a policy which pays out an income until death - on retirement.\nIDS said there were some schemes in good health.\nBut, in many cases, firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle \"yawning deficits\". The level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late 1990s. In 1998/99, for example, contributions rose by 4.7% and in 2002/03 by 8.6%. In contrast, between 1996 and 1998, some employers cut their contribution levels. Helen Sudell, editor of the IDS Pensions Service, said the rise in contributions was \"staggering\" and the highest ever recorded by IDS. \"We have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision,\" said Ms Sudell. \"With figures like this there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes.\"",
    "US retail sales fell 0.3% in January, the biggest monthly decline since last August, driven down by a heavy fall in car sales.\nThe 3.3% fall in car sales had been expected, coming after December's 4% rise in car sales, fuelled by generous pre-Christmas special offers. Excluding the car sector, US retail sales were up 0.6% in January, twice what some analysts had been expecting. US retail spending is expected to rise in 2005, but not as quickly as in 2004.\nSteve Gallagher, US chief economist at SG Corporate & Investment Banking, said January's figures were \"decent numbers\".\n\"We are not seeing the numbers that we saw in the second half of 2004, but they are still pretty healthy,\" he added. Sales at appliance and electronic stores were down 0.6% in January, while sales at hardware stores dropped by 0.3% and furniture store sales dipped 0.1%. Sales at clothing and clothing accessory stores jumped 1.8%, while sales at general merchandise stores, a category that includes department stores, rose by 0.9%. These strong gains were in part put down to consumers spending gift vouchers they had been given for Christmas.\nSales at restaurants, bars and coffee houses rose by 0.3%, while grocery store sales were up 0.5%. In December, overall retail sales rose by 1.1%. Excluding the car sector, sales rose by just 0.3%. Parul Jain, deputy chief economist at Nomura Securities International, said consumer spending would continue to rise in 2005, only at a slower rate of growth than in 2004. \"Consumers continue to retain their strength in the first quarter,\" he said. Van Rourke, a bond strategist at Popular Securities, agreed that the latest retail sales figures were \"slightly stronger than expected\".",
    "The \"best person for the job\" should be appointed lord chancellor, and not necessarily a lawyer or MP, the courts minister has told MPs.\nUnder reforms, the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions. \"The lord chancellor...no more needs to be a lawyer than the Secretary of Health needs to be a doctor,\" said courts minister Christopher Leslie. The Constitutional Reform Bill was entering its second reading on Monday. Mr Leslie said: \"The prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the House of Lords or the House of Commons.\" Under the reforms, the Law Lords will also be replaced as the UK's highest legal authority by a Supreme Court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers.\nIn December the Lords rejected a plea by current Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer. The peers voted by 229 to 206 to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers. The debate was carried over from the last Parliamentary session, but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the Bill passed. Mr Leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs or Lord Chancellor. He said: \"What matters most is...whether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties. \"It is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges.\"\nShadow attorney general Dominic Grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an \"exceptional institution,\" providing a \"champion of the independence of the judiciary\". The government had initially proposed to take this institution and \"smash it to pieces,\" Mr Grieve said. Convention should be \"nurtured and celebrated,\" but the government distrusted and disliked it instead. He warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the House of Lords, the government would have \"great difficulty\" in getting the Bill through Parliament. Former Cabinet minister Douglas Hogg, whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor, said the Bill was \"largely unnecessary, bureaucratic and expensive\". But the Tory MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham admitted the lord chancellor's role and office \"cannot be frozen in aspic\".",

Wales, on the other hand, have played some fine rugby and have made their best start since they last won the title in 1994. They also have a good record at the Stade de France, having won their first two games there, in 1999 and 2001.

    "Former Labour prime minister Lord Callaghan has died on the eve of his 93rd birthday.\nHe passed away at home in East Sussex, just 11 days after his wife Audrey died aged 91. Lord Callaghan, who leaves a son and two daughters, was the longest living former British PM in history. He entered Downing Street in 1976 after the resignation of Harold Wilson. Prime Minister Tony Blair called him a \"giant\" of the Labour movement. He held each of the major offices of chancellor, home secretary, foreign secretary and prime minister during his career and became Lord Callaghan of Cardiff in 1987.\nChancellor Gordon Brown said the former PM would be \"mourned throughout the world\". \"It was a commitment to public service that brought Jim Callaghan into Parliament in 1945, and while Jim rose to the top he never forgot his roots.\" Former cabinet colleague Lord Hattersley said his first reaction on hearing the news was \"immense sadness\".\n\"It was not a major surprise - I knew what a blow the death of his wife Audrey was a few days ago,\" he said. \"He was a decent kindly man who helped me and my generation of politicians immensely.\n\"The Labour party and the country will be poorer without him.\" Conservative peer Lord Heseltine said that despite their political differences, he and Lord Callaghan became friends. \"You don't get to the premiership unless you have a streak of determination,\" he said. \"But I saw the other side of Jim Callaghan, he became a personal friend in a way, and my family and I were very fond of him.\" Tory leader Michael Howard said he would be remembered with \"affection and respect\". Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy said: \"When I was first elected in 1983 as the youngest MP, he was the \"Father of the House\" and as such took a very keen interest in my early days in Parliament.\n\"He was always full of warmth and wisdom.\" Born in 1912 and educated at Portsmouth Northern Secondary School, Lord Callaghan became a clerk at the Inland Revenue. He enlisted in the Royal Navy in 1942 and rose to the rank of lieutenant. Elected for a Cardiff constituency at the 1945 general election, he represented Cardiff seats for more than 40 years. After serving as a junior minister in the Attlee government, he became chancellor of the exchequer when Labour returned to power in 1964.\nWith sterling under pressure, he resisted devaluation for three years, before being forced into it in 1967. His political career was not without controversy. When he refused to support prime minister Harold Wilson and Dame Barbara Castle over the latter's trade union manifesto, In Place of Strife, in 1968, he said: \"I am not going to resign. They will have to throw me out\". When home secretary, he ordered British troops to march into the streets of Belfast to protect Catholic civilians amid rising violence - a decision that has dominated British politics into the 21st century.\nAs foreign secretary in the early 1970s, Lord Callaghan kept an open mind about the UK's entry into the Common Market, seeing the advantages of the UK's entry. He once travelled to Idi Amin's Uganda in 1975 to plead for the life of a British lecturer, Dennis Hills, who was under a death sentence for treason.\nHis political life was often tempered by battles against the hard left of the party. In the autumn of 1978, before the \"Winter of Discontent\" when trade unions carried out strikes that brought the country to a standstill, Lord Callaghan refused to hold an early election which may have delivered a Labour victory. As garbage lay uncollected in the streets and hospital staff, council workers and even gravediggers stayed off work, Lord Callaghan failed to predict the mood of the country. When Britain went to the polls in 1979, Tory leader Margaret Thatcher was swept into power in a landslide victory, and Lord Callaghan resigned as Labour leader.",
    "Oscar-nominated animation Shark Tale has raked in $80m (£42.4m) in the first week of its US DVD release becoming the year's best-selling home video so far.\nThe tally for its DVD and video sales soared past the film's opening week US box office takings of $56m (£29.7m). Shark Tale is now the sixth-highest earning DVD for first week sales. The all-time first-week record is held by 1995's Lion King followed by Shrek 2, Finding Nemo, the original Shrek, and Monster's Inc.\nShark Tale, whose voice cast includes Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renee Zellweger and Martin Scorsese, sold more than 6 million DVDs and videos across the United States and Canada. It becomes the highest first-week earner for February, outshining My Big Fat Greek Wedding which sold four million units in 2003. Films which are expected to earn strong home video returns are usually timed for release in the busiest retail season which falls before Christmas. The best-selling home video of last year was the Dreamworks hit Shrek 2, which took an estimated $458 m (£242.7m) in North America alone.",
    "Security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs.\nThe new strains of the Cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. The Cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the Symbian Series 60 phone operating system. Despite the warnings, there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of Cabir.\nThe original Cabir worm came to light in mid-June 2004 when it was sent to anti-virus firms as a proof-of-concept program. A mistake in the way the original Cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory, the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time.\nHowever, the new Cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range Bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range. Bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. The risk of being infected by Cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it. Users can protect themselves by altering a setting on Symbian phones that conceals the handset from other Bluetooth using devices. Finnish security firm F-Secure issued a warning about the new strains of Cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. All they do is block normal Bluetooth activity and drain the phone's battery. Anti-virus firm Sophos said the source code for Cabir had been posted on the net by a Brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created. So far seven versions of Cabir are know to exist, one of which was inside the malicious Skulls program that was found in late November. Symbian's Series 60 software is licenced by Nokia, LG Electronics, Lenovo, Panasonic, Samsung, Sendo and Siemens.",
    "Paula Radcliffe made a triumphant return to competitive running with victory in the New York Marathon.\nThe Briton, running for the first time since dropping out of the Olympic marathon and 10,000m, held off Kenyan Susan Chepkemei in a thrilling finish. The pair were locked together for the last few miles before Radcliffe finally sprinted clear to win in two hours, 23 minutes and 10 seconds. \"It's a good way to end the year,\" she said. \"I'm ready for a good rest now.\" Radcliffe decided only recently to run in the race and many had doubted whether she had sufficiently recovered from her Olympic ordeal just 11 weeks ago. But the world record-holder was prominent at the head of the field for the whole race as her rivals slowly dropped off the pace. Just Chepkemei and Radcliffe were left in contention as the race came into the final few miles. The Kenyan put in several bursts of speed to throw off Radcliffe but the Briton managed to hang in. Both runners looked to be suffering as they reached the final mile in Central Park. But it was Radcliffe who managed to dredge up a final sprint to see off Chepkemei in the closest finish in the race's history and in the process make a huge step in erasing the disappointment she suffered in Athens.",
    "Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has admitted he is at a loss to explain why Newcastle are languishing in the bottom half of the table.\nThe Gunners travel to St James' Park on Wednesday, with Newcastle 14th in the Premiership after a troubled season. And Wenger said: \"At the beginning of the season you would expect them to be fighting for the top four. \"I don't know how they got to be where they are. It looks to me from the outside that they have many injuries.\"\nArsenal go into the game on the back of a 2-0 victory over Fulham on Sunday. And Wenger added: \"The best way to prepare for a game is to win the previous one. We will go to Newcastle in good shape. \"Fatigue won't play too big a part in the next few weeks as we have players coming back so I can rotate a bit more. \"We do not play a season with 11 players and I believe that all of our squad deserve a chance in the team.\" Striker Thierry Henry, along with Robert Pires, scored against Fulham. And Henry afterwards described the display as \"beautiful to watch\". He said: \"What matters is winning and the three points, of course. That is the only thing that really matters. But it is more enjoyable when you play like we did against Fulham. \"We are playing as a team and that is important because there were some games when we maybe were not there as a team and suffered for that. Those were games we lost.\"",
    "The Conservative Party would deal \"sympathetically\" with any application by disgraced peer Lord Archer to rejoin its ranks, its co-chairman has said.\nDr Liam Fox told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme there was no place for \"vindictiveness\" in politics. Lord Archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice. The former Tory deputy chairman's five-year suspension from the party has just elapsed.\nA jury ruled that Lord Archer lied during a libel trial against the Daily Star at the High Court in London in 1987.\nHe won damages after the newspaper printed allegations about involvement with a prostitute. Dr Fox was asked if he would say yes or no if Lord Archer applied to rejoin. \"I'm sure that in line with people having served their sentence and having done some reparations for what they did wrong, we would look at that sympathetically. \"I don't believe in vindictiveness, I don't think that has any place in politics, unlike the prime minister and Alastair Campbell.\"\nTory peer Lord Tebbit said he agreed with Dr Fox's view, and said the case should be looked at on its merits. \"After all, he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world,\" he added. Meanwhile, senior Conservative MP Sir Teddy Taylor warned that moves bring Lord Archer back into the fold could be controversial. He said: \"I suppose, on a Sunday in particular, we should always make provision for forgiving sinners. But there is no doubt it would be controversial.\" Lord Archer, who was not available for comment, remains a popular figure among constituency Tory parties and is a successful fundraiser. He has not been seen in the House of Lords since his release from prison in July 2003, although there is nothing in the rules to prevent him from attending.",
    "Making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money, an industry conference has been told.\nSony, Microsoft and Nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual E3 games Expo in Los Angeles in May. These so-called \"next generation\" machines will be faster than current consoles, and capable of displaying much higher-quality visuals. For gamers, this should make for better, more immersive games. In a pre-recorded video slot during Microsoft's keynote address at the Game Developers Conference, held last week in San Francisco, famed director James Cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film - believed to be Battle Angel Alita. The game's visual quality would be \"like a lucid dream,\" said Mr Cameron. But numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists, and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop. The first new console, Microsoft's Xbox 2, is not expected to reach the shops until the end of 2005. Games typically take at least 18 months to create, however, so developers are grappling with the hardware today.\nAccording to Robert Walsh, head of Brisbane-based game developer Krome Studios, next generation games will cost between $10-25m to make, with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title. Such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio, said Mr Walsh. \"If you're a start-up, I doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for $10m, however good you are,\" he said. Mr Walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the Sony PSP and the Nintendo DS, since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games.\nOne developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games. The founder of California's Maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game, Spore. Spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures. Starting with an amoeba-sized organism, the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs, jaws and other body parts evolve.\nEventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities, trading and fighting, and even building space ships. Advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other Spore players. These worlds will be automatically swapped across the Internet. Mr Wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game. \"I don't want to put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker or Frodo Baggins - I want them to be George Lucas or Dr Seuss,\" explained Mr Wright. Few games have hinted at the scope of Spore, but Mr Wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers. Instead of employing lots of artists to create 3D models of the digital creatures, Spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers. \"The thing I am coming away with [from the conference] is that next generation content is going to be really expensive, and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market,\" said Mr Wright. \"I'd like to offer an alternative to that.\"\nNew development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games, and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference.\nOxford-based Natural Motion launched Endorphin v2.0, which enables artists to direct a 3D 'virtual actor'. The actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics. Endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs, for instance, or crumples up after a gunshot. Artists can blend together these visual sequences, and include the results in their games. The process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand, and so lessens the need for larger art teams. Another British company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is Manchester start-up Genemation. Its latest tool, GenCrowd, enables artists to create unique, photo-realistic human faces for games involving lots of people. GenCrowd works by blending together elements of an in-built supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities. The software can create up to 2,000 new heads an hour.\nOne area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games. Even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago, so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices.\nThe Game Developers Conference included a special two-day summit dedicated to creating mobile games. A niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago, GDC's Mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates. Mobile games are a fast-growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound, and are thus more suitable for playing games. Furthermore, the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world. It's predicted that by 2006 two billion people will own a mobile phone. The growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected by a keynote given by John Batter, general manager at EA Mobile. EA Mobile is a division of Electronic Arts, the biggest games publisher. Until recently Electronic Arts had been dismissive of games for phones. \"The last time you checked, EA wasn't in this business,\" Mr Batter admitted. But he said EA now planned on dominating the market by releasing mobile versions of its most popular franchises. EA plans to release up to 20 mobile games over the next 12 months. The first will be a version of its Need for Speed racing game, created by EA Mobile's 30-person development team. Mr Batter predicted that by 2006, mobile phones would be capable of running games of comparable quality to those on Sony's upcoming PSP handheld console.\nOwain Bennallack is the editor of Develop magazine.",
    "Two men who were part of a huge network of internet software pirates, known as Drink Or Die, have been convicted at the Old Bailey. BBC News investigates how the network worked and what motivated those involved.\nThey called themselves Drink Or Die (DOD). They were a network of computer buffs who derived pleasure from cracking codes protecting copyrighted software such as Windows 95. They would then share it with each other. There is no suggestion any of them profited financially. But the authorities in both Britain and the United States considered it software piracy and took a dim view of networks such as DOD, one of a number of so-called warez organisations operating on the internet. In October 2000 the US Customs Service began an investigation into DOD and other networks, such as Razor 1911, Risciso, Myth and Popz.\nFourteen months later US Customs co-ordinated a series of raids across the globe as part of Operation Buccaneer. Seventy search warrants were executed in the US, Britain, Australia, Norway, Sweden and Finland. At least 60 people were arrested worldwide - 45 of them in the US. Among the leaders of the network were Americans John Sankus - known by his internet nickname Eriflleh (Hellfire spelt backwards) - Richard Berry, Kent Kartadinata and Christopher Tresco, who used a server based at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\nThe longest jail sentence - 46 months - was handed down to Sankus, a 28-year-old from Philadelphia. US Attorney Paul McNulty said at the time: \"John Sankus and his techno-gang operated in the faceless world of the internet and thought they would never be caught. \"They were wrong. These sentences, and those to follow, should send a message to others entertaining similar beliefs of invincibility.\" But one man still in legal limbo is British-born Australian Hew Raymond Griffiths, who is still fighting against extradition to the US.\nUS Customs claimed Mr Griffiths was one of DOD's leaders but his lawyer, Antony Townsden, told the BBC News website it was a laughable suggestion and added: \"He was living on welfare and had such an old computer that he couldn't even download software. \"The allegation that he was the group's co-leader is illusory. He had the least technical skills of anyone, he couldn't crack any codes and he has only been called a leader because he was a loudmouth who wrote a lot on their messageboard.\" Mr Townsden said if he had committed any crimes he should be prosecuted in Australia, not the US. He claimed the Australian government's decision to accept the extradition request was typical of their current \"acquiescent\" attitude to the US.\nMr Griffiths is expecting to hear this week the outcome of his appeal against the decision to extradite him. Those involved would give themselves internet aliases which would act in the same way as tags used by graffiti artists. They could then brag about their code-cracking abilities without giving away their real identities. Alex Bell, whose trial at the Old Bailey ended on Friday, was known as Mr 2940 - after a computer device - while his co-defendant Steven Dowd's nickname, curiously, was Tim.\nA spokesman for US Immigration, Customs and Enforcement, Dean Boyd, said DOD did not appear to be motivated by money. Their motivation was the kudos which surrounded being able to crack sophisticated software. He told the BBC News website: \"Primarily they were just interested in how fast they could crack the code. It was all about underground notoriety.\" But Mr Boyd pointed out that once the software had been distributed on the internet it fell into the hands of organised criminals who were able to mass produce pirated software at zero cost.\n\"It cost US industries a lot of money, billions of dollars,\" he said. Mr Boyd said: \"It was truly global in scope. We raided a number of universities, including Duke (in North Carolina) and MIT, and found that several of the people involved were employed by major computer corporations. \"They would go home from work in the evenings and get involved in this warez culture.\" Warez groups, which began to surface in the early 1990s, operate according to a strict code of honour.\nFor example if one group cracked the software first its rivals would respect that achievement and not seek to claim it themselves. Mr Boyd said the destruction of DOD was a great coup but he added: \"I'm not going to sit here and say we have sorted the problem. There are still hackers and people who do this for fun. \"Internet piracy of computer software remains a gigantic problem.\" A spokesman for the Business Software Alliance said: \"DOD members claim they did not profit at all. But they did profit by getting access to very expensive servers.\" He said DOD and other warez groups were fostering a \"culture of piracy\" on the internet. He said 29% of computer software in Britain was believed to have been pirated and this cost £1bn in revenue for software companies, their suppliers and distributors. \"It may seem like a victimless crime but it touches more people than you might care to believe.\"",
    "A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.\nThe draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. \"There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,\" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.\nIn December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.",
    "The US dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on Friday as concern grows about the size of the US budget deficit.\nAnalysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the US economy. The Bush administration's apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern. However, trading has been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. This has amplified reactions to news, analysts said, adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in January.\nThe dollar was trading at $1.3652 versus the euro on Friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $1.3667 on Thursday. One dollar bought 102.55 yen.\nDisappointing business figures from Chicago triggered the US currency's weakness on Thursday. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its manufacturing index dropped to 61.2, a bigger fall than expected. \"There are no dollar buyers now, especially after the Chicago data yesterday,\" said ABN Amro's Paul Mackel. At the same time, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. Mr Berlusconi said the euro's strength was \"absolutely worrying\" for Italian exports. Mr Schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances. Investors will now look towards February's meeting of finance ministers from the G7 industrialised nations in London for clues as to whether central banks will combine forces to stem the dollar's decline.",
    "Sri Lanka's president has launched a reconstruction drive worth $3.5bn (£1.8bn) by appealing for peace and national unity.\nPresident Kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from Sri Lanka's economic growth this year. It estimated the wave left physical damage equal to 6.5% of the economy.\nSeparately, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in Sri Lanka and Indonesia alone. It called for action to create jobs. President Kumaratunga attended a ceremony in the southern town of Hambantota. She was joined by government and opposition politicians, together with Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Christian clergy.\nPrime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse laid the foundation stone on a new housing project intended to provide 6,000 homes for survivors of the tsunami. Mrs Kumaratunga called for the tragedy to be \"the start of a new beginning to rebuild our nation\". \"We are a country blessed with so many natural resources and we have not made use of them fully. Instead we have been squabbling, fighting,\" she added. Norway's peace negotiator Erik Solheim is due to arrive on Wednesday to try to revive peace talks in the decades-long conflict between government forces and the Tamil Tigers, who want a separate state in the north east of the country. Reconstruction efforts in eastern Sri Lanka have been hampered by tensions between the two sides.\nThe IMF said that the Sri Lankan authorities' initial estimates have put the physical damage at $1.3 to $1.5bn, but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this. \"The broader macroeconomic impact will clearly be substantial but the details are difficult to assess at this early stage,\" the IMF said. Growth, inflation, the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs. \"The fishing industry has been devastated, agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer, especially in the short term,\" the report said. The ILO estimated that 400,000 Sri Lankans have lost their jobs, mostly in these three industries. Earnings from tourism this year are expected to be 15% lower than last year. Economic growth this year is expected to be 4%, which is about 1% less than previously forecast. Inflation could climb to 14% compared to a previous estimate of 12%. Although major exports have not suffered, the IMF expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments. Foreign exchange reserves may become strained as \"Sri Lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre-tsunami level\" which totalled more than two months worth of imports. Last week, the IMF approved Sri Lanka's request for a freeze on loan repayments.",
    "EuroDisney, the European home of Mickey Mouse and friends, has said it will sell 253m euros (£175m; $328m) of new shares as it looks to avoid insolvency.\nThe sale is the last part of a plan to restructure 2.4bn euros-worth of debts. Despite struggling since it was opened in 1992, EuroDisney has recently made progress in turning its business around and ticket sales have picked up. However, analysts still question whether it attracts enough visitors to stay open, even with the restructuring.\nEuroDisney remains Europe's largest single tourist attraction, attracting some 12.4 million visitors annually. A new attraction - Walt Disney Studios - has recently opened its site near Paris. The company's currently traded stock tumbled in Paris on the latest news, shedding 15% to 22 euro cents. EuroDisney will sell the new shares priced at 9 euros cents each. The US Disney Corporation and Saudi Arabian prince Al-Walid bin Talal, the firm's two main shareholders, will buy the new stock. The restructuring deal is the second in the firm's troubled financial history; its finances were first reorganised in 1994.",
    "Former England captain Martin Johnson has announced he is to retire from rugby union at the end of the season.\nJohnson, who captained England to World Cup glory in 2003, will play his final match in June. Johnson won 84 England caps and quit Test rugby at the start of 2004, just two months after leading Sir Clive Woodward's team to victory in Sydney. The 34-year-old Leicester lock's final match will be his testimonial at Twickenham on 4 June. \"I'm confident I have made the right decision to retire,\" said Johnson. \"I'm sure there will be times next season when I'll wish I was out there playing for the Tigers, but you know when the time is right to go and I feel this is the right time. \"I feel physically that I could play for another season, but playing week in and week out in the Premiership is a full-time occupation and I only want to be out there for the right reasons.\" Johnson will always be revered by England fans for captaining England to their dramatic World Cup win against Australia in Sydney, but his list of achievements does not stop at that.\nHe is the only man to captain the Lions twice and he also led England to a Six Nations Grand Slam. Johnson also had huge success as captain of Leicester, guiding the Tigers to back to back Heineken Cup victories and several Premiership titles. Apart from his marvellous captaincy Johnson was also one of the finest second rows to ever play the game. Teak tough and physically intimidating, he ruled the rucks and mauls for the best part of a decade and was integral in England's rise to the top of the world game. His final appearance will be in his testimonial at Twickenham, where he will lead a team against a side captained by New Zealand winger Jonah Lomu. The All Black is aiming to return to action after a kidney transplant and Johnson expects it to be a memorable occasion. \"This game against Jonah will be a great way to end the season and end my career,\" said Johnson. Lomu, rugby union's first global superstar after his exploits in the 1995 World Cup, said he was proud to be part of Johnson's farewell. \"We hold him in such high esteem,\" said Lomu. \"He is such a great leader and I am just honoured to be on the same pitch.\"",
    "Mark Philippoussis is almost certain to miss the Australian Open after suffering a groin injury during the Hopman Cup loss to the Netherlands.\nThe 28-year-old suffered two tears to the adductor muscle and was unable to play in the deciding mixed doubles. He is now unlikely to be fit in time for the Australian Open which begins on 17 January in Melbourne. \"He has to strengthen it enough to cope with repetitive days of tennis,\" said Hopman Cup doctor Hamish Osborne. \"It would be very unlikely in my opinion for him to do a five-setter once, let alone two days in a row, inside two weeks.\n\"The injury is more common in Australian Rules football, and a fit footballer would normally take three to four weeks to recover fully although Mark's injury is slightly different.\" The Australian has suffered a host of injury problems throughout his career but is still holding out slim hope that he can make the event. \"It's something I'll have to go by feel. I'll start treatment as soon as possible and try to strengthen it without tearing it any more,\" he said. \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I know I can come back from this and that's all that matters.\n- Former world number two Tommy Haas is also a doubt for the Australian Open after picking up a thigh injury playing for Germany in the Hopman Cup.

    "People using wireless high-speed net (wi-fi) are being warned about fake hotspots, or access points.\nThe latest threat, nicknamed evil twins, pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations, say Cranfield University experts. Once logged onto an Evil Twin, sensitive data can be intercepted. Wi-fi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability. London leads the global wi-fi hotspots league, with more than 1,000. The number of hotspots is expected to reach 200,000 by 2008, according to analysts. \"Users need to be wary of using their wi-fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature,\" said Professor Brian Collins, head of information systems at Cranfield University.\n\"Users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wi-fi device has its security measures activated,\" he added. BT Openzone, which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the UK, told the BBC News website that it made every effort to make its wi-fi secure. \"Naturally, people may have security concerns,\" said Chris Clark, chief executive for BT's wireless broadband.\n\"But wi-fi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet, like broadband or dial-up.\" He said BT Openzone, as well as others, have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot. \"This means that users' personal information and data, logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure,\" said Mr Clark.\nIn the vast majority of cases, base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible, said Dr Nobles. Cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam, jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client. Anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin. \"Cybercriminals don't have to be that clever to carry out such an attack,\" said Dr Phil Nobles, a wireless net and cybercrime expert at Cranfield. \"Because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency.\"\nAlthough wi-fi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use high-speed net on the move, there have been fears over how secure it is. Some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security. A wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a company's computer system. Public wi-fi hotspots offered by companies like BT Openzone and The Cloud, are accessible after users sign up and pay for use. But many home and company wi-fi networks are left unprotected and can be \"sniffed out\" and hi-jacked by anyone with the correct equipment. \"BT advises that customers should change all default settings, make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly,\" said Mr Clark. \"We also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted.\" Dr Nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the Science Museum's Dana Centre in London on Thursday.",
    "Now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital TV, DVDs, and digital video recorders, the next revolution for TV is being prepared for our sets.\nIn most corners of TV and technology industries, high-definition (HDTV) is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour. HD essentially makes TV picture quality at least four times better than now. But there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about HD on the High Street. Thousands of flat panel screens - LCDs (liquid crystal displays), plasma screens, and DLP rear-projection TV sets - have already been sold as \"HD\", but are in fact not able to display HD.\n\"The UK is the largest display market in Europe,\" according to John Binks, director of GfK, which monitors global consumer markets.\nBut, he added: \"Of all the flat panel screens sold, just 1.3% in the UK are capable of getting high-definition.\" There are 74 different devices that are being sold as HD but are not HD-ready, according to Alexander Oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant Astra. They may be fantastic quality TVs, but many do not have adaptors in them - called DVI or HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors - which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images. Part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the High Street, say industry experts, who gathered at Bafta in London for the 2nd European HDTV Summit last week. \"We have to be careful about consumer confusion. There is a massive education process to go through,\" said Mr Binks. The industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of us who will be watching it. Eventually, that will be everyone. The BBC is currently developing plans to produce all its TV output to meet HDTV standards by 2010.\nPreparations for the analogue switch-off are already underway in some areas, and programmes are being filmed with HD cameras. BSkyB plans to ship its first generation set-top boxes, to receive HDTV broadcasts, in time for Christmas. Like its Sky+ boxes, they will also be personal video recorders (PVRs). The company will start broadcasts of HDTV programmes, offering them as \"premium channel packages\", concentrating, to start with, on sports, big events, and films, in early 2006. But the set-top box which receives HDTV broadcasts has to plug into a display - TV set - that can show the images at the much higher resolution that HD demands, if HDTV is to be \"real\". By 2010, 20% of homes in the UK will have some sort of TV set or display that can show HD in its full glory.\nBut it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to \"being digital\". As a result, all the key players, those who make flat panel displays, as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters, formed a HD forum in 2004 to make sure they were all talking to each other. Part of the forum has been concerned with issues like industry standards and content protection. But it has also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for.\nFrom next month, all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a \"HD-Ready\" sticker. This also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and HDTV signals, and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry. \"The logo is absolutely the way forward,\" said David Mercer, analysts with Strategy Analytics. \"But it is still not appearing on many retail products.\" The industry is upbeat that the sticker will help, but it is only a start. \"We can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers,\" said Mr Oudendijk. \"There may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months.\" The European Broadcast Union (EBU) is testing different flavours of HD formats to prepare for even better HDTV further down the line. It is similarly concerned that people get the right information on HDTV formats, as well as which devices will support the formats. \"We believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile,\" said Phil Laven, technical director for the EBU. The TV display manufacturers want us to watch HD on screens that are at least 42in (106cm), to get the \"true impact\" of HD, they say, although smaller displays suffice. What may convince people to spend money on HD-ready devices is the falling prices, which continue to tumble across Europe. The prices are dropping an average of 20% every year, according to analysts. LCD prices dropped by 43% in Europe as a whole last year, according to Mr Oudendijk.",
    "The woman behind the Abba musical Mamma Mia! has joined a list of British-based music millionaires.\nProducer Judy Craymer is the highest new entry in the Sunday Times' music rich list, with a £67m fortune. Ms Craymer remortgaged her home to finance her idea of a musical based around Abba's hits, which has since become a global triumph. Teenage soul singer Joss Stone is a new entry on a list of Britain's young music millionaires with £5m.\nMs Craymer, who developed Mamma Mia! with playwright Catherine Johnson and members of Abba, is at number 31 on the music rich list. But taking the top spot for a second year is former record label boss Clive Calder, whose wealth has risen to £1.3bn. Mr Calder is the man behind acts including Britney Spears. He made his fortune by selling his independent label Zomba to record giant BMG. Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney is second on the list with £800m - up £40m on last year. Andrew Lloyd-Webber's wealth rose an estimated £300m on last year, to £700m, while theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh's fortune rose from £340m to £400m.\nHis recent hits have included the West End show Mary Poppins. But Pop Idol mogul Simon Fuller has seen his wealth plummet from £220m last year to £75m after selling his entertainment company 19 for less than expected, according to the Sunday Times. Joss Stone, the 17-year-old soul singer from Devon, was a new entry in the young music millionaires list. The list also features Charlotte Church, Coldplay, Daniel Bedingfield, Will Young and David and Victoria Beckham. At number one is Dhani Harrison, son of the late Beatle George Harrison, who has inherited £140m. The Beckhams - who qualify thanks to Victoria's former singing career - are in second place with £75 million between them - up £10m on last year.",
    "Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner.\nGlobally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly \"must-have\" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.\nCamera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.\nMobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.\nImages from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.\nThe exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said.",
    "German investment bank Deutsche Bank has challenged the right of Yukos to claim bankruptcy protection in the US.\nIn a court filing on Tuesday, it said the Russian oil giant has few Texas ties beyond bank accounts and a Texas-based finance chief. Deutsche Bank claimed Yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset. It had wanted to help fund Gazprom's plans for a $10bn (£5.18bn) bid for Yukos unit Yuganskneftegas.\nDeutsche Bank would have earned large fees from the deal, which could not be carried out because US chapter 11 bankruptcy rules made the Kremlin's auction of Yuganskneftegas on 19 December illegal under US law.\nBut the US bankruptcy court judge in Texas granted Yukos an injunction that barred Gazprom and its lenders from taking part. Yuganskneftegas will ultimately end up with Gazprom. The winning bidder at the auction was a previously unknown firm, Baikal Finance Group, which was snapped up days later by Rosneft, a Russian oil firm that is in the process of merging with Gazprom. The effect of these transactions is to renationalise Yuganskneftegas. Deutsche Bank contends Yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in Texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the 19 December auction of its top unit by the Russian government, which was in a tax dispute with Yukos.\n\"This blatant attempt to artificially manufacture a basis for jurisdiction constitutes cause to dismiss this case,\" Deutsche Bank said in its court filing. Mike Lake, a spokesman for Yukos' lawyers, said on Tuesday that the company stands by its legal action. Yukos is confident of its right to US bankruptcy protection, and \"we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again,\" he said. Yukos has said it intends to seek $20bn in damages from the buyer of Yuganskneftegas once the sale finally goes through. In its filing, Deutsche Bank said Houston was \"a jurisdiction in which Yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations.\"\nIt also said the US bankruptcy court should not become involved in \"a tax dispute between the Federation and one of its corporate citizens\". It suggested the European Court or an international arbitration tribunal were more appropriate jurisdictions for the legal fight between Russia and Yukos. The next hearing in the bankruptcy is expected on 6 January. Analysts believe the tax dispute between the Russian government and Yukos is partly driven by Russian president Vladimir Putin's hostility hostility to the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khordokovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail, and on trial for fraud and tax evasion.",
    "A team of US researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer.\nFour people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. Previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. The New York team reported their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \"The results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions,\" said Jonathan Wolpaw and Dennis McFarlane. The research team, from New York State Department of Health and State University of New York in Albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought.\nThe four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which, meant no surgery or implantation was needed.\nBrain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. Complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. Such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. \"The impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm, a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis,\" said the researchers. The four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. Although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. It is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments. Some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. Earlier this year, a team at the MIT Media Labs Europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.",
    "US oil prices have fallen by 6%, driven down by forecasts of a mild winter in the densely populated northeast.\nLight crude oil futures fell $2.86 to $41.32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), and have now lost $4 in five days. Nonetheless, US crude is still 30% more expensive than at the beginning of 2004, boosted by growing demand and bottlenecks at refineries. Traders ignored the possible effects of Asia's tidal waves on global supplies.\nInstead, the focus is now on US consumption, which is heavily influenced in the short term by the weather. \"With the revised milder temperatures... I'm more inclined to think we'll push lower and test the $40-40.25 range,\" said John Brady of ABN AMRO. \"The market definitely feels to be on the defensive.\" Statistics released last week showed that stockpiles of oil products in the US had risen, an indication that severe supply disruptions may not arise this winter, barring any serious incident. Oil prices have broken records in 2004, topping $50 a barrel at one point, driven up by a welter of worries about unrest in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, rising demand and supply bottlenecks. London's International Petroleum Exchange remained closed for the Christmas holiday.",
    "The US dollar has dropped against major currencies on concerns that central banks may cut the amount of dollars they hold in their foreign reserves.\nComments by South Korea's central bank at the end of last week have sparked the recent round of dollar declines. South Korea, which has about $200bn in foreign reserves, said it plans instead to boost holdings of currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollar. Analysts reckon that other nations may follow suit and now ditch the dollar. At 1300 GMT, the euro was up 0.9% on the day at 1.3187 euros per US dollar. The British pound had added 0.5% to break through the $1.90 level, while the dollar had fallen by 1.3% against the Japanese yen to trade at 104.16 yen.\nAt the start of the year, the US currency, which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows, staged something of a recovery.\nAnalysts, however, pointed to the dollar's inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data, and highlighted the fact that many of the US's economic problems had not disappeared. The focus once again has been on the country's massive trade and budget deficits, with predictions of more dollar weakness to come. \"The comments from Korea came at a time when sentiment towards the dollar was already softening,\" said Ian Gunner, a trader at Mellon Financial. On Tuesday, traders in Asia said that both South Korea and Taiwan had withdrawn their bids to buy dollars at the start of the session. Mansoor Mohi-Uddin, chief currency strategist at UBS, said that there was a sentiment in the market that \"central banks from Asia and the Middle East are buying euros\". A report last month already showed that the dollar was losing its allure as a currency that offered rock-steady returns and stability. Compiled by Central Banking Publications and sponsored by the UK's Royal Bank of Scotland, the survey found 39 nations out of 65 questioned were increasing their euro holdings, with 29 cutting back on the US dollar.",

We have definitely shown that. \"Also injuries and suspensions haven't cost us too badly and we have a lot of self-belief around the place.\"",
    "Shares in online auction house eBay fell 9.8% in after-hours trade on Wednesday, after its quarterly profits failed to meet market expectations.\nDespite seeing net profits rise by 44% to $205.4m (£110m) during October to December, from $142m a year earlier, Wall Street had expected more. EBay stock fell to $92.9 in after-hours trade, from a $103.05 end on Nasdaq. EBay's net revenue for the quarter rose to $935.8m from $648.4m, boosted by growth at its PayPal payment service.\nExcluding special items, eBay's profit was 33 cents a share, but analysts had expected 34 cents.\n\"I think Wall Street has gotten a bit ahead of eBay this quarter and for the 2005 year.\" said Janco Partners analyst Martin Pyykkonen. For 2004 as a whole, eBay earned $778.2m on sales of $3.27bn. EBay president and chief executive Meg Whitman called 2004 an \"outstanding success\" that generated \"tremendous momentum\" for 2005. \"I'm more confident than ever that the decisions and investments we're making today will ensure a bright future for the company and our community of users around the world,\" she said. EBay now forecasts 2005 revenue of $4.2bn to $4.35bn and earnings excluding items of $1.48 to $1.52 per share. Analysts had previously estimated that eBay would achieve 2005 revenues of $4.37bn and earnings of $1.62 per share, excluding items.",
    "The battle for control of Manchester United has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from US business tycoon Malcolm Glazer.\nNo formal offer has been made yet, but Manchester United have confirmed they have received a \"detailed proposal\" from the US entrepreneur which could lead to a bid. Reports have put the offer at 300p per share, which would value Manchester United at about £800m ($1.5bn). The approach by the 76-year-old owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team is reportedly being led by his two sons, Avi and Joel. A previous approach to the United board by Mr Glazer in October last year was turned down. However, the BBC has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand.\nMr Glazer's previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover. That would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed \"not... in the best interests of the company\" by Manchester United's board when they rejected his approach last year. However, Mr Glazer's latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by £200m.\nWhile United's board may be casting a serious eye over Mr Glazer's latest proposals, supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal.\nSupporters' group Shareholders United - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to Mr Glazer's campaign - said it would fight any move. \"Manchester United are a debt-free company. We don't want to fall into debt and we don't need to fall into debt,\" Shareholders United's Sean Bones told the BBC. United's players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover. \"A lot of people want the club's interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart,\" Rio Ferdinand told BBC Radio Five Live. \"No-one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table.\"\nThe key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of United's largest shareholders, the Irish horse racing tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus. Through their Cubic Expression vehicle they own 28.9% of the club. Mr Glazer owns 28.1%. Joe McLean, a football specialist at accountancy firm Grant Thornton, said the support of Mr Magnier and Mr McManus was \"utterly crucial\". \"Mr Glazer's bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment. \"If that's the case, the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about 300 pence, maybe 305. \"If that's the case then Mr Glazer might well secure their support - if he does, this bid could well go ahead.\"\nIndeed it is. Malcolm Glazer was little-known in the UK until he started to build up his stake in Manchester United in late 2003. In February 2004 he said he was \"considering\" whether to bid for the club. No bid emerged, but Mr Glazer continued to increase his holding in the club. In October 2004, Manchester United said they had received a \"preliminary approach\", which turned out to have come from Mr Glazer. However, the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve. At the club's annual general meeting in November, Mr Glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board. Legal adviser Maurice Watkins, commercial director Andy Anson and non-executive director Philip Yea were voted out, against the wishes of chief executive David Gill. But the move led to bankers JP Morgan and public relations firm Brunswick withdrawing from the Glazer bid team.",
    "Michael Howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned Tory tax cuts.\nShould he win the next general election, he has earmarked £4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how. This was the pre-election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters, he believes, will warm to. At its simplest, it is saying: \"Vote Tory and you can have it both ways\". Not only would his government stick to Labour spending plans on core public services, including health and education, it would increase spending on defence, police and pensions. And even after that was done, it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax.\nAll the money would come from its £35 billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy, waste and the civil service. Of that, £23 billion would go on spending plans, with £8 billion to fill the black hole left, they claim, by Gordon Brown, and the rest going in tax cuts.\nNeither Mr Howard nor Mr Letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash, although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely. Ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax, although some in the Tory party are urging Mr Howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election. As the Tory leader declared, the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between Labour and the Tories. \"At this election, people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair who will waste more and tax more and the Conservative party which will give value for money and tax less,\" he said.\nIt is a move back towards an almost traditional Tory message which previously suggested Labour was the party of tax rises and the Conservatives the party of tax cuts.\nThe extension of that, however, was that Labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the Tories were the cutters. And that is where one of the problems lies for Mr Howard - can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services AND lower taxes? He insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into Downing Street. Labour, needless to say, claim his planned £35bn efficiency savings simply don't add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy.\nOne of New Labour's greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was to persuade voters, business and the City that it could be trusted to run the economy. So far that has not faced any real challenge, but independent analysts now claim a third New Labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day. So, Mr Howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor. And, while other issues like the Iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign, it is likely - and the prime minister probably hopes - that the economy will be the deciding factor.",

    "Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange.\nSpeaking at the Soccerex football business forum in Dubai, he said a full listing was \"one of the options\" for funding after the club moves to its new stadium. The club - which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 2006/07 season. Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season.\nWhen Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years' time. The club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover, and has not ruled out other money-earning means, including a full share listing. \"When the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review,\" Mr Dein said.\n\"Listing would be one option, but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet. \"We want to be in the best financial health - maybe clubs can do it (listing), Manchester United have been a success.\"\nMr Dein said that, although television money and coverage had driven the English game forward in the past 10 years, he feared there might now be too many games being shown. Since the formation of the Premier League in season 1992/93, Premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar. \"Television has been the driving force over the past 10 years... but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world's leading league competition. \"We must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline, and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on TV too. \"I think we have practically reached saturation point... sometimes I think less is more.\"\nThe club is funding its move to Ashburton Grove through a number of sources, including debt from banks, from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors, and from the sale of surplus property, including its Highbury Stadium. It is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets, including Asia. \"We have two executives travelling round Japan and China at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs, and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too, as they are around the world. \"We have got a very good product, so it is very important we go and look at these markets, and make sure we are on the case.\"",
    "Two of Britain's big trade unions could merge to form a \"super union\" of two million members.\nThe move by Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers. Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000. Any merger would have to be approved by the unions' executives and their membership. It is understood meetings will be held on Wednesday about the proposal. Along with the GMB and Unison, the TGWU and Amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56-point deal with Labour's leadership over equality at work, holidays and pensions - the Warwick Agreement. Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours, but one insider pointed out to the BBC News website that \"nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda\" when the two unions' executives hold their meetings on Wednesday. Amicus's executive was due to meet in any case although the TGWU is holding specially scheduled talks.",
    "Japanese communications firm Softbank has widened losses after heavy spending on a new cut-rate phone service.\nThe service, launched in December and dubbed \"Otoku\" or \"bargain\", has had almost 900,000 orders, Softbank said. The firm, a market leader in high-speed internet, had an operating loss for the three months to December of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; £38.4m). But without the Otoku marketing spend it would have made a profit - and expects to move into the black in 2006. The firm did not give a figure for the extent of profits it expected to make next year. It was born in the 1990s tech boom, investing widely and becoming a fast-rising star, till the end of the tech bubble hit it hard. Its recent return to a high profile came with the purchase of Japan Telecom, the country's third-biggest fixed-line telecoms firm. The acquisition spurred its broadband internet division to pole position in the Japanese market, with more than 5.1 million subscribers at the end of December.",
    "A major distributor of pirated DVDs of Bollywood films has been sent to prison for three years.\nJayanti Amarishi Buhecha from Cambridge was found guilty of two trademark offences last month, and sentenced at Harrow Crown Court, London, on Tuesday. Buhecha, who made £26,000 per month from his illegal trade, was called \"one of the biggest Bollywood pirates in the UK\" by the sentencing judge. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) worked for two years on the case.\nAn operation was launched against Buhecha in 2002 after complaints were received about his activities. The judge in the case, which lasted seven days, said that \"a heavy penalty was called for because of the enormous damage Buhecha caused to legitimate business\". Fake DVDs were manufactured in Pakistan and Malaysia and sold on wholesale to shops by Buhecha, who traded in conterfeit DVDs in 2002 and 2003.\nIn December 2002, he was stopped in his car by trading standards officers, who uncovered 1,000 pirated DVDs and faked inlay cards printed with registered trademarks. Despite being arrested and bailed, Buhecha was caught a second time at the end of 2003. His home and a lock-up in Cambridge were found to contain 18,000 counterfeit DVDs and further faked inlay cards. Buhecha was previously a legitimate distributor of Bollywood films, but was suspended and sued by his employers for dealing in illegal copies of Bollywood classic Mohabbatein. Legitimate Bollywood film distributors have hailed the conviction as \"a major boost\". Bollywood music and film suffers piracy at the rate of 40%, which is more than that suffered by mainstream productions. The BPI welcomed the news of the prison sentence, but warned there are plenty of other active counterfeiters of Bollywood films. The organisation's anti-piracy director David Martin said: \"The problem simply will not disappear with Buhecha. Others and more will take his place, so it's vital that keep up our efforts in this field.\"",

Last year MAB, which opposed the war in Iraq, urged Muslims not to vote for Labour in the European elections. But a spokesman stressed the meeting was \"not necessarily anti-Labour\". \"This meeting is not anti-party in particular, it's anti-policy, it's on the issues we are going to ask Muslims to vote on,\" MAB spokesman Dr Azzam Tamimi said of Tuesday's event.\n\"There are issues of concern to Muslims, and Muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues.\" Dr Tamimi said the main issues Muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on Iraq, the Palestinian situation, the erosion of civil liberties for Muslims in the UK and economic, social and education problems.\nApproximately 1.1m of the UK's 1.6m Muslims are of voting age. Previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted Labour, but more recent studies have suggested Labour support has been falling away significantly among some Muslim voters.\nAnger over the war in Iraq has appeared to be the main reason, with many saying it was \"unjustified\". Representatives from a number of Muslim organisations will attend Tuesday's event. Among them will be the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). The chairman of the MCB's public affairs committee, Sher Khan, said the war in Iraq would be a \"significant factor\" affecting Muslims' voting intentions. \"I think it's going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact,\" Mr Khan said.\nHowever, Professor John Curtice, of the University of Strathclyde, is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by Muslims could make. \"For the most part the Labour constituencies where there's a large Muslim community are relatively safe, but there are one or two that are not quite so safe,\" Professor Curtice said.\nThe constituencies where Labour was most at risk from a Muslim tactical vote were Bethnal Green, in east London, and Rochdale in Lancashire, he added. In Bethnal Green, former Labour MP George Galloway, who founded the anti-war party Respect, is standing against sitting MP Oona King, who had a 10,000-vote majority in 2001. In Rochdale, the Liberal Democrats - the mainstream party a 2004 ICM survey showed was benefiting most from Muslim disaffection with Labour - secured second place in the 2001 election, securing just under 6,000 votes fewer than Labour's Lorna Fitzsimons. But Professor Curtice said the Muslim anti-war vote could be split between the Liberal Democrats and Respect, meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box. \"Ironically the Tories might be the beneficiaries if Labour does lose seats, which is generally the case,\" he said. But Dr Tamimi said MAB's intention was not to \"empower\" the Tories. \"We know the next government will be Labour, but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the Muslims use their vote properly. \"If the next Labour government has a reduced majority that's a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country,\" Dr Tamimi said.",
    "Rafael Nadal continued his run of fine form to beat Guillermo Canas and reach the Mexican Open semis in Acapulco.\nEighth seed Nadal, who picked up his second ATP title when he beat Alberto Martin in last week's Brazil Open, saw off the Argentine third seed 7-5 6-3. He now meets Argentine wild card Mariano Puerta, who followed up his win over top seed Carlos Moya by overcoming Spain's Felix Mantilla, 6-4 3-6 7-6. Czech fifth seed Czech Jiri Novak was eliminated 7-5 6-1 by Agustin Calleri. The unseeded Argentine, who won the tournament two years ago, now plays Spain's Albert Montanes. Montanes advanced to his first semi-final of the year with a 4-6 6-3 6-4 triumph over sixth-seeded Italian Filippo Volandri. Argentina's Agustin Calleri beat fourth seed Jiri Novak 7-5 6-1 in a battle of former champions at the Mexican Open. Calleri won his only ATP title in Acapulco two years ago while Novak won the singles and doubles titles in 1998. Calleri will face Albert Montanes in the semi-finals after the Spaniard ousted sixth seed Filippo Volandri of Italy 4-6 6-3 6-4.

    "Scotland manager Walter Smith says he wants to restore the national team's respectability in world football.\nSmith has joined his first squad for a three-day get-together near Manchester in preference to playing a friendly. While qualification for the 2006 World Cup appears to be beyond Scotland, Smith is anxious that the remainder of the campaign should be positive. \"I think we have got to try to get a bit of respectability back in whatever way we can,\" he said. \"We will have to approach each game differently. Obviously we will have to approach the Italian game away from home in a different manner to Moldova at home. \"We have to meet the challenge of each match.\" Smith, meeting a number of his squad for the first time, brought them together on Monday to outline his ideas for improving the nation's fortunes.\nHe said: \"I pointed out how I see the international team going forward and that was the main topic. \"This is a relaxed gathering and I don't think there is a lot of doom and gloom about the squad that a lot of people think exists.\" A 25-man squad will spend the next three days based at the Mottram Hall hotel in Cheshire and will train at Manchester United's nearby Carrington complex. Smith will be absent for the final sessions, however, as he is due to fly out to Sardinia on Wednesday to watch Italy's friendly with Russia.",
    "Celtic's Neil Lennon admits Rangers could be considered \"slight favourites\" for the Old Firm CIS Cup clash, but insists his side can still win.\nLennon concedes Rangers are in good form at the moment, but they have failed to beat Celtic in their last seven meetings. \"Rangers are on the up and have been on a good run in recent weeks,\" he said. \"But it's a game we believe we're capable of winning if we play our best,\" he told the Evening Times. \"All the boys are looking forward to it because they are brilliant games to be involved in. \"Without playing at the top of our game, we have still been winning matches. \"At the minute, we are at the top of the league and still in with a chance of staying in Europe, so I don't think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out. \"Of course, it is a concern when you are losing goals, because we have been notorious for being a team that is hard to beat and keeping clean sheets, but hopefully we are over that wee run. \"Considering we lost Henrik Larsson at the end of last season, we have still been scoring a lot of goals, which is pleasing.\"",
    "Shares in music giant EMI have sunk by more than 16% after the firm issued a profit warning following disappointing sales and delays to two album releases.\nEMI said music sales for the year to March will fall 8-9% from the year before, with profits set to be 15% lower than analysts had expected. It blamed poor sales since Christmas and delays to the releases of new albums by Coldplay and Gorillaz. By 1200 GMT on Monday, EMI shares were down 16.2% at 235.75 pence.\nEMI said two major albums scheduled for release before the end of the financial year in March - one by Coldplay and one by Gorillaz - have now had their release dates put back.\n\"EMI Music's sales, particularly re-orders, in January have also been lower than anticipated and this is expected to continue through February and March,\" the company added. \"Therefore, for the full year, at constant currency, EMI Music's sales are now expected to be 8% to 9% lower than the prior year.\" The company said it expected profits to be about £138m ($259.8m). Alain Levy, chairman and chief executive of EMI Music, described the performance as \"disappointing\", but added that he remained optimistic over future trends in the industry. \"The physical music market is showing signs of stabilisation in many parts of the world and digital music, in all its forms, continues to develop at a rapid pace,\" he said.\nCommenting on the delay to the release of the Coldplay and Gorillaz albums, Mr Levy said that \"creating and marketing music is not an exact science and cannot always coincide with our reporting periods\". \"While this rescheduling and recent softness is disappointing, it does not change my views of the improving health of the global recorded music industry,\" he added. Paul Richards, an analyst at Numis Securities, said the market would be focusing on the slump in music sales rather than the timing of the two albums. \"It's unusual to see this much of a downgrade just because of phasing,\" he said.",
    "The Office's Ricky Gervais is writing an episode of hit US cartoon The Simpsons, following an invitation from its creator Matt Groening.\nGervais has already begun writing the script but is keeping its subject matter a closely guarded secret. He will also write a part for himself in the episode. \"I've got the rough idea but this is the most intimidating project of my career. The Simpsons is the greatest TV show of all time,\" he said. Groening recently heaped praise on The Office, saying: \"Everybody on The Simpsons is a fan of The Office - it's one of the best shows on TV in the last decade.\" Gervais has already said he would not guest star in the show as his Office character David, having left him behind for good in the Christmas specials. The Office became a surprise US success when it was screened on cable channel BBC America. The first series won two Golden Globes in 2004 for best comedy and best TV actor for Gervais.\nIn winning it beat the likes of Sex and the City and Will and Grace. An American version was produced, but so far only a pilot has been broadcast - to much criticism that it failed to live up to the original. At the British Comedy Awards on Wednesday, Gervais was handed a special achievement award for writing. But The Office missed out in the best comedy show category to Little Britain. Matt Groening was also at the awards to collect the award for best international comedy for The Simpsons.",
    "A US company has pulled out of a major contract to rebuild Iraq's transport system after attacks on reconstruction efforts, Pentagon officials have said.\nContrack International, of Arlington, Virginia, heads a coalition of firms working on a series of schemes. Its withdrawal from the $325m (£170m) contract in November is thought to be the largest cancellation to date. Contrack said \"the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner\". But the firm denied reports it was withdrawing completely from Iraq. \"Members of the joint venture including Contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts, are actively working in Iraq and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country,\" it said in a statement. The Pentagon's Project and Contract Office (PCO) in Baghdad said it had taken over Contrack's management of the subcontractors working on the transportation projects.\nUS firms and their workers have been targets of attacks, and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in Iraq. Of the $18.4bn in reconstruction funds approved by Congress, less than $2bn has been spent. Lt Col Eric Schnaible of the PCO told the Associated Press news agency Contrack's withdrawal from the transportation contract was a \"mutually agreed-to separation\" and did not indicate a movement by US companies to leave Iraq. \"Some parts of the country are a whole lot more permissive than others,\" he added. \"Where we can get the work done, good things are happening.\"",
    "An Indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country.\nTata Teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers' offices and its own core network. The laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections. In 12 months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than 700 locations.\n\"In this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task,\" said Mr R. Sridharan, vice president of networks at Tata. \"Heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult,\" he said. In some locations, he said, permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get. He said it was far easier to secure permission for putting networking hardware on roofs. This has led Chennai-based Tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between Tata's core network and the premises of customers. The Lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network. The hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses.\nThe laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps (2,000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection) but Tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 1-2mbps. The lasers are also ideal for India because of its climate. \"It's particularly suitable as the rain rate is a little low and it's hardly ever foggy,\" he said. In places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds. The laser links also take far less time to set up and get working, said Mr Sridharan. \"Once we get the other permissions, normal time period for set up is a few hours,\" he said. By contrast, he said, digging up roads and laying cables can take weeks or months. This speed of set up has helped Tata with its aggressive expansion plans. Just over 12 months ago the firm had customers in only about 70 towns and cities. But by the end of March the firm hopes to reach more than 1,000. \"Speed is very important because of the pace of competition,\" said Mr Sridharan.",
    "Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has agreed to buy medical technology firm Guidant for $25.4bn (£13bn).\nGuidant is a key producer of equipment that combats heart problems such as implant defibrillators and pacemakers. Analysts said that the deal is aimed at offsetting Johnson & Johnson's reliance on a slowing drug business. They also pointed out that more mergers are likely because the drug and healthcare industries are fragmented and are under pressure to cut costs. A number of Johnson & Johnson's products are facing patent expirations, while the company is also battling fierce competition from generic products. Meanwhile, demand for defibrillators, which give the heart a small electric shock when an irregular heartbeat or rhythm is detected, is expected to increase, analysts said. The move by Johnson & Johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay $76 for each Guidant share, 6% more than Wednesday's closing price. Analysts say that US antitrust regulators could force the firms to shed some overlapping stent operations. Stents are tubes that are used to keep an artery open after it has been unblocked.",
    "The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.\nAccording to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs in January. The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year's election. However, when adding December and January's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory.\nThe Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.\nAnalysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. \"It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,\" said Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group. \"We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment.\" \"The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,\" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. \"That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.\"",

    "Listen to the full interview on Sport on Five and the BBC Sport website from 1900 GMT.\nBut Parry, speaking exclusively to BBC Sport, also admits Gerrard, who has been constantly linked with Chelsea, will have the final say on his future. He told BBC Five Live: \"Steven is above money. He is the future of Liverpool. \"It doesn't matter if it's £30m, £40m or £50m, we will not accept offers. But we are also realistic enough to know we can't keep Steven against his will.\" On the subject of Liverpool's finances, Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium.\nAnd responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan. Parry joined Liverpool as chief executive in July 1998 from a similar role at the Premier League. There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard.\nOn the subject of Liverpool's captain and prize asset, Parry revealed Real Madrid\ndid\nask for an option on the England midfield man during negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes. He said: \"They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes, but the response to Real Madrid was the same - Steven is not for sale.\" But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season, Parry said: \"I sincerely hope he will be. Steven knows my views. He knows Rafa's views. \"We have re-affirmed recently to Steven that we are trying to build a team around him. We crave success as much as he does. We know he's ambitious and nobody can argue with that.\n\"I think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else. \"We all want to see progress by next season. He's not alone in that. There are a lot of other players who feel the same, so we all have a common aim.\" It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a £30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. \"There have been a lot of open secrets about Steven, most of which have been complete myths. It is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. We didn't had an offer last summer,\" Parry explained. \"We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn't want to sell him. In reality it didn't go beyond that. \"Maybe there will be an offer in the summer. Maybe there won't.\n\"Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. \"You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will. That just doesn't work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda. You can forget that.\" Parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for Liverpool's new stadium in Stanley Park, which is set to open in 2007. And he confessed Arsenal's £100m deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the Anfield club serious food for thought. He said: \"I have to say historically it is something I have been against, and I have been on record as saying that, but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eye-opener.\n\"I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even been worth contemplating. \"But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say 'wow - that's interesting.' \"My personal point of view is that I would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium.\" Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but Parry countered: \"I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. \"If it was the right partner how strong an issue is it? Time will tell. \"I think the stadium will always be Anfield, not least because of where it is, but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship? I think it would be remiss not to. \"That's not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but I think it is clearly something we have to explore.\"\nOn the subject of possible new investment, Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the Middle East. That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan, who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. He also accused Liverpool of using him as \"a stalking horse\" to attract other bids, but Parry explained: \"Steve has never been used as a stalking horse. There's no need, and that is not the way we do business. \"We had discussions with Steve over the course of 2004. I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen. \"Quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December, and as I have said it was of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it. We are still evaluating it. \"Steve's interest was taken very much on its own merits. His enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold? \"The door isn't closed on anything. We had a perfectly sensible dialogue with Steve last year. \"We have a common interest in making Liverpool successful. That's a dream we all share, so as far as I'm concerned the door is not closed.\"\nI would take £50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him. As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really?\n£50m for Gerrard? I don't care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrard's quality.\nThrough a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.\nCritical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard. Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. I am hoping he doesn't walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash.\n£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it. I would however be happy with Gerrard's transfer for any fee over £35m.\nParry's statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry.\nI would keep Gerrard. No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.\nThe key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. Clearly, if he isn't, then we would be foolish not to sell. The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football.",
    "Microsoft's Internet Explorer has a serious rival in the long-awaited Firefox 1.0 web browser, which has just been released.\nFew people get excited when some new software is released, especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player. But the release of the first full version of Firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of pre-launch fervour. Fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the New York Times announcing that version 1.0 of the browser is available. The release of Firefox 1.0 on 9 November might even cause a few heads to turn at Microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant's Internet Explorer browser.\nFirefox has been created by the Mozilla Foundation which was started by former browser maker Netscape back in 1998. Much of the development work done since then has gone into Firefox which made its first appearance under this name in February. Earlier incarnations, but which had the same core technology, were called Phoenix and Firebird. Since then the software has been gaining praise and converts, not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Rivals to IE got a boost in late June when two US computer security organisations warned people to avoid the Microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability.\nInternet monitoring firm WebSideStory has charted the growing population of people using the Firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of IE. Before July this year, according to WebSideStory, Internet Explorer was used by about 95% of web surfers. That figure had remained static for years. In July the IE using population dropped to 94.7% and by the end of October stood at 92.9%. The Mozilla Foundation claims that Firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10% of the Windows- using, net-browsing population. Firefox is proving popular because, at the moment, it has far fewer security holes than Internet Explorer and has some innovations lacking in Microsoft's program. For instance, Firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them. It blocks pop-ups, has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed.\nOne of the most powerful features of Firefox is the many hundreds of extras, or extensions, produced for it. The Mozilla Foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program. This has resulted in many different add-ons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar Google toolbar to a Homeland Security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels. Firefox, which used to be called Firebird and before that Phoenix, also has a growing number of vocal net-based fans. A campaign co-ordinated by the Spread Firefox website attempted to raise the $50,000 needed for a full page advert in the New York Times. The campaign set itself a target of recruiting 2500 volunteers. Ten days in to the campaign 10,000 people had signed up and now about $250,000 has been raised. The ad is due to run sometime in a three-week period in late November/early December. The surplus cash will be used to help keep the Mozilla Foundation running. Microsoft is facing a growing challenge to IE's hold on the web using population. from alternative browsers such as Opera, Safari, Amaya and even Netscape.",
    "Car manufacturers with plants in South Africa, including BMW, General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen, have seen a surge in demand during 2004.\nNew vehicle sales jumped 22% to 449,603 from a year earlier, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA) said. Strong economic growth and low interest rates have driven demand, and analysts expect the trend to continue. NAAMSA said it expects sales to top 500,000 in 2005. During 2004 \"South Africa was one of the best performing markets internationally\" for car sales, NAAMSA said. While domestic demand is set to continue to enjoy rapid growth, foreign sales could come under pressure, analysts said. The vehicle industry accounts for about 13% of South Africa's total exports. However, the world auto market has its problems and analysts warn that overcapacity and the strength of the rand could hit exports.",
    "They may not know quite how to describe their position in British politics - the real opposition, the valid opposition, the effective opposition or the authentic opposition.\nBut the Liberal Democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they, not the Tories, who are now the real threat to Labour. As Tory leader Michael Howard kicked off his election campaign, the Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy dismissed the Conservatives as a \"fading\" force. And he insisted there was \"no limit\" to his party's ambitions in the coming poll. And he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things. Sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test.\nAnd Mr Kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party's Westminster HQ. He would make no predictions other than that he expected the Lib Dems to increase both their votes and their Commons seats at the election.\nThe gap between Labour and the Tories was now so narrow - as proved, he claimed, by the defection to Labour of Robert Jackson - that only his party offered a genuine alternative. On the war on Iraq, identity cards, student fees and the council tax, there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the Liberal Democrats offered costed, sensible alternatives. He was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than £100,000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees, the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax. He was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to \"prop up\" either of the other big parties after the election.\nThere was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self-delusion. That is no longer the case with the Liberal Democrats. The other parties will still insist that the Lib Dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats.\nLabour, in particular, fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the Lib Dems allowing the Tories to win some seats. But Mr Kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that. He will not talk about the big breakthrough, although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold. They would argue that, by the time of the election after next, the Liberal Democrats may genuinely have replaced the Tories as the party challenging Labour for power. The Lib Dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on Iraq. But Mr Kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible, costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name.",
    "Fifty new areas getting special help to fight anti-social behaviour in England and Wales will be named on Thursday.\nTen areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. Details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. Labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. A year ago, ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and Thursday's figures offer a progress check. They will say that in the past year more than 2,600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.\nPolice have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders, breaking up groups of youths in public places. The 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. Exeter and Cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved.\nPrime Minister Tony Blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of Asbos and fixed penalty notices. There are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly.\nHe is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed. \"We have not defeated this problem by any means, but shown together what can be done,\" he will say. Mr Blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws, saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance.\nMinisters also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25,000 community support officers (CSOs). But researchers from Leeds University warned that CSOs could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. More work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before CSOs, they argued in a the study. Critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. Home Office Minister Hazel Blears also revealed this week that \"about a third\" of Asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.",

MCI's directors have backed Verizon, despite it tabling less money. They are accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by depriving MCI shareholders \"of maximum value\".\nAccording the legal papers filed in a Delaware court, Verizon is set to pay an \"\"unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate\" sum for MCI, which was formerly known as Worldcom. Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. A number of large MCI shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that Verizon's offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company. Friday's lawsuit argues that the Verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the US phone industry will put a premium on MCI's network, assets and clients. MCI's directors have argued that Verizon is bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Chief executive Michael Capellas spent last week meeting with shareholders in an effort to win their backing.\nIn 2002, investors in the then-named Worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal. However, the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. It is a long-distance and corporate phone firm, and would provide the buyer with access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. MCI shares jumped on Friday, hitting their highest level since April 2004 amid speculation that it would be the focus of a bidding war. A takeover of MCI would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone pioneer AT&T for about $16bn.",
    "Climate change and the fight against Aids are leading the list of concerns for the first day of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos.\nSome 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe will listen to UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's opening speech on Wednesday. Mr Blair will focus on Africa's development plans and global warming. Earlier in the day came an update on efforts to have 3 million people on anti-Aids drugs by the end of 2005. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said 700,000 people in poor countries were on life-extending drugs - up from 440,000 six months earlier but amounting to only 12% of the 5.8 million who needed them. A $2bn \"funding gap\" still stood in the way of hitting the 2005 target, the WHO said.\nThe themes to be stressed by Mr Blair - whose attendance was announced at the last minute - are those he wants to dominate the UK's chairmanship of the G8 group of industrialised states. Other issues to be discussed at the five-day conference range from China's\neconomic power to Iraq's future after this Sunday's elections. Aside from Mr Blair, more than 20 other world leaders are expected to attend including French President Jacques Chirac - due to speak by video link after bad weather delayed his helicopter - and South African President Thabo Mbeki, whose arrival has been delayed by Ivory Coast peace talks. The Ukraine's new president, Viktor Yushchenko, will also be there - as will newly elected Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. Showbiz figures will also put in an appearance, from U2 frontman Bono - a well-known campaigner on trade and development issues - to Angelina Jolie, a goodwill campaigner for the UN on refugees.\nUnlike previous years, protests against the WEF are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. At the same time, about 100,000 people are expected to converge on the Brazilian resort of Porto Alegre for the World Social Forum - the so-called \"anti-Davos\" for campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes.\nIn contrast, the Davos forum is dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world's 500 largest companies scheduled to attend. A survey published on the eve of the conference by PricewaterhouseCoopers said four in ten business leaders were \"very confident\" that their companies would see sales rise in 2005. Asian and American executives, however, were much more confident than their European counterparts. But the political discussions, focusing on Iran, Iraq and China, are likely to dominate media attention.",
    "James McIlroy motored to the AAA's Indoor 800m title in Sheffied on Sunday in a time of one minute, 47.97 seconds.\nThe Larne athlete dominated the race from start to finish although he had to hold off a late challenge from Welshman Jimmy Watkins in the final 100 metres. \"I had to go out and go through all the gears before the Europeans and I won't run again until then,\" said McIlroy. ''I though if I got lucky I'd get close to the British record but I blew up in the end.'' McIlroy has been in superb form at the start of the season and will now start his build-up for the European Indoors at Madrid on 4-6 March. Meanwhile, Paul Brizzel and Anna Boyle reached the semi-finals of the 60m hurdles with Boyle setting a season's best of 7.48. In the women's 60m final, Ailis McSweeney broke Michelle Carroll's long-standing Irish record by clocking 7.37 which left her in third place. David Gillick showed that he is a genuine medal contender in the European Indoor Championships by claiming an impressive 400m victory. Gillick was more than half-a-second clear when taking gold in 46.45 - .02 outside his personal best set in Saturday's semi-finals.\nThe Irishman is now the fastest European this season. Derval O'Rourke broke her own Irish 60m hurdles record by clocking 8.06 which left her third behind new British record holder Sarah Claxton (7.96). James Nolan (3:46.04) took second in the men's 1500m behind Neil Speaight (3:45.86) but the Offaly man was outside the European Indoor standard. Colin Costello was seventh in the 1500m final in 3:48.82). Deirdre Ryan was second in the women's high jump with a clearance of 1.87m while Aoife Byrne took silver in the 800m in a personal best of 2:06.73. Lisburn's Kelly McNeice Reid (4:31.34) was seventh in the women's 1500m while Gary Murray (8:11.22) was 11th in the men's 3000m. Meanwhile, Stephen Cairns and Jill Shannon claimed the individual titles at Saturday's Northern Ireland Cross Country Championship in Coleraine. Cairns came in ahead of Paul Rowan and Allan Bogle in the men's race. Willowfield claimed their first men's team title in 72 years while Shannon helped Lagan Valley win the women's team honours.",
    "The German music business - the third largest in the world - is \"in the state of a zombie\" because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy, a leading industry figure has said.\nTim Renner, the head of Universal Music Germany until last year, told BBC World Service's The Music Biz programme that the country's music industry was now struggling to survive. Renner warned that unless the industry accepted \"new realties\" - such as downloading - its decline could become irreversible. \"The problem the music industry has got is that they aren't willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out,\" he stated. \"So the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie.\"\nThe music market in Germany peaked in 1997, with sales of 2.6bn euros (£1.8bn). Since 2000, sales have plummeted to just 1.6bn euros (£1.1bn) in 2003. In the space of one year - between 2002 and 2003 - CD album sales fell by 13.8%. But a study by the Society for Consumer Research found that at the same time, more than twice as many recordable CDs had music recorded on them than CD albums were sold. Mr Renner pointed out that, because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a good-selling record, this was particularly damaging.\n\"You need time,\" he added. However, Peter Zombic, the managing director of the International Federation of Phonographic Industry in Germany, said he did not feel the situation was as \"dramatic\" as Mr Renner believed. \"It's quite true that we have severe problems in Germany - but that's true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too,\" he argued. \"We have a severe problem with piracy, especially internet piracy, and we also have a severe problem of private copying. \"I don't agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact, especially in regard to Germany talent, the market is quite successful.\" He did, however, admit that copyright owners have \"partly lost control of their copyright\", due to piracy and copying.\nBut he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading. \"We were the first to implement a download service - back in 1997,\" he argued. \"At that time it was not successful, because of the advent of piracy - it was the Napster time, when P2P services became popular. \"It still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned.\" Mr Zombic also called for a change to the perception in Germany that private copying of music is not a problem. German law does allow people to make copies of CDs for their family and close friends, without fear of breaking copyright. Mr Zombic said that this legal framework was a \"huge problem\". \"There is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby, it's nice, it's fun,\" he added. \"We try to make clear it's not nice and it's not fun - it's endangering the creativity in our country.\"",
    "Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venice's famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.\nViotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milan's La Scala and the Vienna State Opera. His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet's Manon last week.\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti's last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Vienna State Opera.",
    "England captain Jason Robinson will miss the rest of the Six Nations because of injury.\nRobinson, stand-in captain in the absence of Jonny Wilkinson, had been due to lead England in their final two games against Italy and Scotland. But the Sale full-back pulled out of the squad on Wednesday because of a torn ligament in his right thumb. The 30-year-old will undergo an operation on Friday but England have yet to name a replacement skipper.\nRobinson said: \"This is very disappointing for me as this means I miss England's last two games in the Six Nations at Twickenham and two games for my club, Sale Sharks. \"But I'm looking to be back playing very early in April.\"\nRobinson picked up the injury in the 19-13 defeat to Ireland at Lansdowne Road on Saturday. And coach Andy Robinson said: \"I am hugely disappointed for Jason. \"As England captain he has been an immense figure during the autumn internationals and the Six Nations, leading by example at all times. I look forward to having him back in the England squad.\" The announcement is the latest setback for Robinson's injury-depleted squad.\nAmong the key figures already missing are Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall, Will Greenwood, Julian White and Phil Vickery - a list which leaves Robinson short on candidates for the now vacant captaincy role. Former England skipper Jeremy Guscott told BBC Radio Five Live his choice would be Matt Dawson, even though he is does not hold a regular starting place.\n\"The obvious choice is Dawson\" said Guscott. \"Especially given that Harry Ellis did not have his best game at scrum-half on Saturday. \"Dawson has the credentials and the experience, even though his winning record at captain is not great. \"The other option in Martin Corry, who is the standout forward at the moment. \"Unfortunately England cannot rely on leaders on the field at the moment.\" England will announce their squad for the 12 March game against Italy on Saturday.",
    "Some 65 years ago Bernardo Gandulla left Boca Juniors in his native Argentina and headed for Brazil.\nHe arrived at the Vasco da Gama club with considerable prestige - which he failed to live up to. He left an impression, but not for reasons he would have wanted. The only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play. Even today, 'gandula' is the term used in Brazil for ballboy. Brazilians delighted in the failure of Gandulla then, and many will delight now if history is repeated. Another Boca Juniors player is coming to Brazil. 'The new Maradona' - Carlos Tevez - is joining Corinthians for nearly $20m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year. Corinthians - or the London-based company who have just entered into partnership with them - appear to have paid well above the odds for Tevez. It is particularly strange as - until last week - Tevez was not even an especially big name in Brazil, where the Argentine Championship is not shown.\nPresumably there is some financial logic behind the move. What is harder to work out is why Tevez should be interested in heading north, rather than across the Atlantic. Argentina's brightest new star hit top form in August as he spearheaded the charge towards the Olympic gold medal. But the subsequent months have not been easy for Tevez. Boca re-signed Martin Palermo, forcing Tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role. And off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report - Atletico Madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be 'disorganized.' Hounded by the press, Tevez grew tired of his life in Buenos Aires. So now he says that he is heading for Corinthians in search of 'tranquillity.' Anyone acquainted with the city of S&#227;o Paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration. Brazil's biggest city is a sprawling, ugly, restless metropolis. Once it shared with Buenos Aires the same melancholy air of a city of Italian immigrants.\nBut that world now lies buried under skyscrapers. The most turbulent place in this frenetic city is Sport Club Corinthians. It is the most passionately supported club in Brazil. Pel&#233; scored reams of goals against them, reasoning that unless he did something special the Corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own. That passion can also be turned against the team - especially nowadays, when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in Brazil's big cities. Corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players. Tevez, then, can kiss tranquillity goodbye. He can also say farewell to the Copa Libertadores, South America's Champions League. Corinthians have not qualified. Indeed, he will have a long wait for a worthwhile match. Next year's Brazilian Championship only gets underway at the end of April. Until then he will have to make do with the foolish S&#227;o Paulo State Championship, an appalling waste of his talent. There will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to Argentina. Like so many of the top South American players, Tevez has the gift of being able to surprise - to feint right and go left, to pass when he was expected to dribble, to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares. But his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all.",
    "Jack Straw has attacked the decision by Britain's highest court that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws.\nThe foreign secretary said the right to life was the \"most important liberty\" and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism. Law lords were \"simply wrong\" to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. New Home Secretary Charles Clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.\nThe House of Lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government's anti-terror policy.\nBut Mr Straw denied it amounted to a \"constitutional crisis\". He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court. \"The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The foreign secretary insisted it was for Parliament, and not judges, to decide how best Britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. He said the Law Lords' ruling was an \"embarrassment\" for the government and major changes were needed to the law.\nThe ruling came on Charles Clarke's first day as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation. In a statement to MPs, Mr Clarke said: \"I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.\n\"In the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords.\" The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. But those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. On Thursday, Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: \"Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.\nIn a statement, detainee 'A' in Woodhill Prison said: \"I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones.\" The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. Solicitor Gareth Pierce, who represents eight of the detainees, claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to \"madness\", saying two were being held in Broadmoor hospital.",
    "Shares in Cairn Energy, a UK oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.\nThe company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable. Cairn's shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year. Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he was \"disappointed\" with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan. Investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a \"significant downgrade of the initial expectation\".\nCairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. The company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; £10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. A spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field's current value.\n\"Cairn refutes the government's position,\" Mr Gammell said. He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - India's state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - and not the contractor. \"We have a pretty strong legal case here,\" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statements though. The shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. \"I think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,\" said analyst Jason Kenney at ING.\nThe disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for Cairn's existing oilfields. The company raised targets for its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in India from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. \"These two fields will provide the core of the future developments in Rajasthan,\" Mr Gammell said. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to South Asia from interests in the US and Europe. Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.",
    "Stars of the Eurovision Song Contest from the show's 50-year history are to compete against each other to celebrate the contest's anniversary.\nViewers will choose 14 past songs to be performed by the original artists or others in the spirit of the originals. Past Eurovision performers include Abba, Celine Dion, Bucks Fizz, Nana Mouskouri, Lulu and Julio Iglesias. Fans will then vote as usual to pick the all-time best Eurovision song during the show in Denmark in October. The first contest was organised by the European Broadcasting Union, or EBU, in 1956, and has become an annual event pitting pop giants against musical minnows - with often surprising results.\nWhile some regard it as an essential celebration of continental talent, others see it as an equally unmissable parade of the reasons some countries do not normally produce international stars. The 50th annual contest will be held in Kiev, Ukraine, in May, after Ukrainian singer Ruslana won last year. The 50th anniversary special will be held in Denmark later this year because the Danish Broadcasting Corporation came up with the idea for the all-time contest. A plan to hold it in London was scrapped because of problems finding a suitable venue. Ireland has been the most successful country in the show's history with seven victories, followed by the UK, France and Luxembourg with five each.",
    "Oscar-winner Andrea Arnold has been congratulated by the UK Film Council, the organisation which partly funded her project.\nArnold's film Wasp won the best live action short film award on Sunday. \"The UK Film Council spends millions of pounds of lottery investment on short filmmaking in Britain every year,\" said chief executive officer John Woodward. \"It certainly pays off when you see new film-makers winning such prestigious awards,\" he added.\nWasp, which was commissioned by the Film Council and Channel 4, beat films by fellow UK nominees Gary McKendry and Ashvin Kumar to the prize. It stars actress Nathalie Press, who appeared in the Bafta-winning drama My Summer Of Love, as a single mother who is forced to take drastic action when she is invited on a date and is unable to find a babysitter to look after her four daughters. The film has already won over 30 other international awards including the Sundance Short Film Prize. Arnold, from Dartford in Kent, described her victory as \"truly overwhelming. I'm really not used to this kind of thing,\" she said, after receiving her Oscar from actor Jeremy Irons. \"Thanks to everyone who worked on this - the beers are on me when we get home.\" The director was one of only two British winners on the night, the other being Sandy Powell, who won the costume design Oscar for her work on The Aviator.",
    "Italy coach John Kirwan has challenged his side to match the performance they produced in pushing Ireland close when they meet Wales on Saturday.\nDespite losing 28-17 in Sunday's Six Nations encounter, the Italians confirmed their continuing improvement. \"Our goal is to match every side we face and against Ireland we showed we could do that,\" said Kirwan. \"But the most important thing is that we build on that performance when we play Wales on Saturday.\" Italy's half-backs had a mixed afternoon, with recalled scrum-half Alessandro Troncon impressing but fly-half Luciano Orquera having an off-day with the boot. Kirwan said: \"I was very happy with Troncon. He had an incredible game - he was very good in attack and defence. \"Orquera's kicking was off but he showed great courage in defence. \"He also followed the game plan. We have to give him confidence because he has the capability to do well.\"",
    "Rising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on Monday after a finance ministers' meeting and stern words from Fed chief Alan Greenspan.\nThe London FTSE fell 0.8% while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dropped 2.11%, its steepest fall in three months. G20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in Japan and Europe. And Mr Greenspan warned Asian states could soon stop funding the US deficit.\nOn Monday afternoon, the euro was close to an all-time high against the dollar at above $1.30. Oil pushed higher too on Monday, as investors fretted about cold weather in the US and Europe and a potential output cut from oil producers' group Opec, although prices had cooled by the end of the day. In London, the benchmark Brent crude price closed down 51 cents at $44.38 a barrel, while New York light sweet crude closed down 25 cents at $48.64 a barrel. The slide comes as the US has been attempting to talk up the traditional \"strong dollar\" policy.\nThe latest to pitch in has been President George W Bush himself, who told the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Chile that he remained committed to halving the budget deficit. Together with a $500bn trade gap, the red ink spreading across America's public finances is widely seen as a key factor driving the dollar lower. And last week US Treasury Secretary John Snow told an audience in the UK that the policy remained unaltered. But he also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets - a signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar. Some had looked to the G20 meeting for direction. But Mr Snow made clear exchange rates had not been on the agenda.\nFor the US government, letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term fix.\nUS exports get more affordable, helping perhaps to close the trade gap. In the meantime, the debt keeps getting bigger, with Congress authorising an $800bn rise in what the US can owe - taking the total to $8.2 trillion. But in a speech on Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky. At present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to Asian states such as Japan and China, since the dollar is seen as the world's reserve currency. Similarly, Asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the US as a whole spends and what it earns. But already they are turning more cautious - an auction of debt in August found few takers. And Mr Greenspan said that could turn into a trend, if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the value of those investments. \"It seems persuasive that, given the size of the US current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point,\" he said.",
    "Scotland manager Walter Smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the Home International series.\nSuch a plan is to be proposed by the new chief executive of the Northern Irish FA, Howard Wells, at the next meeting of the four home countries. The English FA has expressed doubt as to whether the fixtures could be accommodated at the end of each season. But Smith said: \"Bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and that's something that's needed.\" The Home International series was done away with in 1984, with the traditional Scotland-England fixture continuing until 1989. That game is one Smith would be delighted to see reinstated. \"The Scotland v England match was a highlight of the end of the season,\" he added. \"I was in Italy for their friendly with Russia last week and they made seven substitutions while only around 20,000 fans turned up to watch. \"England were criticised for the 0-0 draw against Holland - the way Scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies. \"You have to put a performance on in friendly games. If you don't, they can be de-motivating. \"It can be a dangerous road to go down, if players don't apply themselves in the manner they should. \"So I would support the return of the home internationals - the only problem would be fitting them in to the fixture schedule.\"",
    "Boss Graeme Souness felt Newcastle were never really in danger of going out of the Uefa Cup against Heerenveen.\nAn early own goal followed by an Alan Shearer strike earned them a 2-1 win and a place in the Uefa Cup last 16. \"Obviously with winning in the first leg it gave us a great advantage,\" he said after the 4-2 aggregate victory. \"We got our goals early and in the minds of some players the job was done but then they got a goal and perhaps made us a bit nervous.\" Shearer's goal moved him within 12 of Jackie Milburn's club scoring record of 200 for the Magpies. But Souness said he did not think beating the record would have any bearing on his decision to retire at the end of the season. \"I think if he got it this year he would want to stay next year anyway,\" he added.\n\"He struck the ball very well - he always has done - and I think it was the power and pace that beat the goalkeeper.\" Souness also paid tribute to Laurent Robert, who was at the heart of much of United's attacking play. \"In the first half he did really well and did everything you want from a wide player. More of the same in future please,\" he said.",
    "England forward Martin Corry says Jason Robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways.\nAfter losses to Wales and France, critics have started to wonder whether Robinson can captain from full-back. But Corry has backed Robinson, who was given the role after the injury to fly-half Jonny Wilkinson, ahead of this weekend's trip to Ireland. \"Jason is doing a tremendous job. Every week my respect for him goes up,\" Corry told BBC Radio Five Live. \"He is an inspirational captain. When he talks with the squad he talks with a lot of sense. \"The players have a lot of respect for him. It's an honour to be in the England side and an honour to play under him.\"\nEngland are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their Six Nations campaign. But Corry insists England are in the right frame of mind for the contest. \"There is apprehension going into every game,\" he added. \"But you have to use that fear and put it into a positive mindset. \"When the whistle goes on Sunday, what has happened in the past does not count for anything.\n\"We have not performed but if we put in a performance on Sunday then we can start turning results around. \"There are a lot of changes taking place with England and we are at the start of something. We have not got off to the greatest of starts but you need to experience the bad the before you can fully appreciate the good.\"\nA trip to Lansdowne Road is daunting at any time, especially against an Ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins. They are the form team of the tournament and are tipped to claim their first Grand Slam since 1948. But Corry is relishing the prospect of taking on the Irish in their own backyard. \"They are full of confidence and are playing a great team game,\" he said. \"The forwards are creating a great platform and they have explosive runners out wide. \"If you look at the team on paper, they have stars from one to 15. It's a huge task but it is a great opportunity for us. \"Lansdowne Road is a tremendous venue to play in and we have to use it to our advantage.\"",
    "Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini will miss Sunday's Carling Cup final after the club dropped their appeal against his red card against Newcastle.\nThe Italian was sent off for bringing down Shola Ameobi in the final minute of Sunday's match. Blues boss Jose Mourinho had promised to pick Cudicini for the final instead of first-choice keeper Petr Cech. The 31-year-old will now serve a one-match suspension commencing with immediate effect.\nCudicini kept a club record 24 clean sheets last season for Chelsea, but Petr Cech has established himself as first choice for Mourinho since moving to Stamford Bridge in summer 2004. The 22-year-old Czech Republic international has set a new Premiership record of 961 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal, a mark which is still running. But Mourinho has used Cudicini regularly in the Carling Cup, and the Italian has only let in one goal in his four appearances during Chelsea's run to the final.",
    "Andre Agassi's involvement in the Australian Open was put in doubt after he pulled out of the Kooyong Classic with a hip injury.\nAgassi was serving at 5-6 down in the first set to fellow American Andy Roddick when he decided to bring a premature end to the match. \"My hip was cramping and I just could not continue,\" said the 34-year-old. Agassi, who has won the Australian Open four times, will have an MRI scan to discover the extent of the damage. He said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss Wimbledon last year.\n\"The good news is that it didn't just tear, it was tightening up and that can be your body protecting itself, which is hopefully more of the issue,\" he added. \"That wasn't comfortable out there at all, what I was feeling. \"I have to wait and see what I'm dealing with - it's a pretty scary feeling out there when something doesn't feel right and is getting worse. \"It's very disappointing and I'll have to do my best to deal with it. Time will shortly tell if it (the Australian Open) is a possibility or not. \"I was not counting on this being the end of the day for me. \"Maybe in a few days I'll have a much better sense of what my hopes will be.\"",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\nSlower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\nAnd recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\nBusiness groups welcomed the MPC's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"",
    "Middlesbrough midfielder James Morrison has been ruled out for up to eight weeks after an operation on Tuesday.\nThe 18-year-old, who has played in 13 of the club's last 14 games, had surgery to repair a double hernia. A club spokesman confirmed: \"It is a bilateral sportsman's hernia, which was operated on yesterday.\" Morrison was sent for scans after being substituted at half-time during Boro's 2-1 UEFA Cup win over Graz AK in which he scored the equaliser. His injury is the latest blow for the Teessiders, who have been without Gaizka Mendieta, George Boateng and Mark Viduka for extended periods.

    "Shares in Manchester United were up over 5% by noon on Monday following a new offer from Malcolm Glazer.\nThe board of Man Utd is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal from the US tycoon that values the club at £800m ($1.5bn). Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer. A senior source at the club told the BBC: \"This time it's different\". The board is obliged to consider this deal. But the Man Utd supporters club urged the club to reject the new deal. Manchester United past and present footballers Eric Cantona and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and club manager Sir Alex Ferguson, have lent their backing to the supporters' group, Shareholders United. They have all spoken out against the bid.\nA spokesman for the supporters club said: \"I can't see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer's previous proposals) other than £200m less debt. \"He isn't bringing any money into the club; he'll use our money to buy it.\"\nMr Glazer's latest move is being led by Mr Glazer's two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times. A proposal was received by David Gill, United's chief executive, at the end of last week, pitched at about 300p a share. David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a \"well funded\" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club. \"I do not think there is anything that Manchester United fans can do about it,\" he told the BBC. \"They can complain about it but it is curtains for them. They may not want him but they are going to get him.\" The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with \"detailed proposals\", it has confirmed.\nMr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. He is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal, though it is not clear by how much. For his proposal to succeed, he needs the support of United's largest shareholders, the Irish horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier. They own 29% of United through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle. Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid. NM Rothschild, the investment bank, is advising Mr Glazer, according to the Financial Times. His previous adviser, JPMorgan, quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board, against its advice. But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazer's latest financial proposal.",
    "Reports that Tony Blair is planning a snap general election for February 2005 have been described as \"idle speculation\" by Downing Street.\nA spokesman said he had \"no idea\" where the reports in the Sunday Times and Sunday Telegraph had come from. The papers suggest ministers believe the government could benefit from a \"Baghdad bounce\" following successful Iraq elections in January. A British general election was last held in February in 1974. In that election, Edward Heath lost and failed to build a coalition with the Liberals. Harold Wilson took over and increased his majority later in the year in a second election\nThe latest speculation suggests the prime minister favours a February poll in order to exploit his current opinion poll lead over Conservative leader Michael Howard. But that strategy could prompt criticism he was seeking to \"cut and run\" after less then four years of a parliamentary term. The papers report that Alan Milburn, Labour's head of elections strategy, has played a key role in the plan for a February election, which would include a New Year advertising blitz. New Labour's campaign, both newspapers said, would be centred around the slogan \"Britain is Working\". A Labour Party spokesman said the election date was ultimately a matter for Mr Blair, but he was unaware of anything to suggest it would be in February. Most commentators have been expecting an election on 5 May. The last election was in June 2001.",
    "Tony Blair says he will be facing the issue of trust and his own integrity head on during the election campaign.\nDuring a question and answer session with first-time voters on Five News, Mr Blair said he had no option but to \"confront it\" by talking to people. He also dismissed claims government plans to get 50% of young people into university would devalue degrees. He was not \"forcing\" anyone to go to university, but places should be there for those who wanted them, he said. In answer to a question from 22-year-old Liverpool student David Dunne about concerns over the prime minister's personal integrity, Mr Blair said talking was the only answer. \"You've just got to confront it and say to people let's have a discussion on the things that worry you, the things that make you say 'I can't trust you' or 'I am against you on this.'\" The \"worst thing in politics\" was that the electorate only got \"little snatches of policy\" from things like Prime Minister's Questions and the news headlines. This was why he wanted to \"get out of the 30 seconds on the news,\" he added.\nBy talking through policies at least people understood the reason for them, even if they did not agree with them, he said. Mr Blair also faced questions about British policy on Iran and its alleged nuclear weapons programme. He insisted there was no plan for an invasion of the country saying: \"Sometimes people say because of what has happened in Iraq this is the next place.\" Instead there was a real chance of a \"peaceful resolution\" to the problem, he said.",
    "Southampton's David Prutton faces a possible seven-match ban when he goes before the Football Association.\nThe 23-year-old has admitted two charges of improper conduct following his dismissal against Arsenal. The first charge relates to his failure to leave the field promptly, pushing referee Alan Wiley and remonstrating with assistant referee Paul Norman. And the second charge is for using threatening words and/or behaviour to a match official during the 1-1 draw.\nPaolo di Canio was given a seven-match suspension when he pushed referee Paul Alcock over in a Premiership game between Sheffield Wednesday and Arsenal in 1998. Prutton will be joined at Wednesday's hearing by Saints boss Harry Redknapp, who believes that the FA will throw the book at his player. Redknapp himself sprinted along the touchline to help physio Jim Joyce and coach Denis Rofe shepherd the enraged Prutton away from referee's assistant Norman. \"David has made a big mistake and he knows it. I can't condone what he's done. He was out of order but he knows that,\" said Redknapp. \"He's a decent lad. He over-reacted badly for some reason - he had a rush of blood from somewhere. Off the pitch you couldn't meet a nicer lad.\" Prutton has apologised publicly for his actions and to Arsenal's Robert Pires, who was injured in a wild tackle by the Saints' midfield man.\nHe said: \"It's an horrendous situation. I apologise to the ref and linesman, who were only doing their job. \"I've also seen what happened to Pires' leg and I'm sorry for that as well.\" \"I apologise for the people who saw it. I know you get lots of kids going to the match now and they don't pay money to see that sort of thing. \"It's not a cop-out, but it was all a bit of a blur.

    "Paula Radcliffe has called for all athletes found guilty on drugs charges to be treated as criminals.\nThe marathon world record holder believes more needs to be done to rid athletics of the \"suspicions and innuendoes\" which greet any fast time. \"Doping in sport is a criminal offence and should be treated as such,\" the 30-year-old told the Sunday Times. \"It not only cheats other athletes but also cheats promoters, sponsors and the general public.\"\nRadcliffe's comments come at a time when several American sports stars are under suspicion of steroid use. \"Being caught in possession of a performance-enhancing drugs should carry a penalty,\" she added.\n\"The current system does not detect many of the substances being abused by athletes. \"This means that often athletes do not know if they are competing on a level playing field, if their hard work and sacrifice is being trumped by an easier scientific route. \"Often, when an athlete puts in a good performance, they are subjected to suspicions and innuendoes instead of praise. \"Having been on the receiving end of accusations like this I can testify as to how much this hurts.\"",

Springer helped launch the West End show and attended the opening night. \"I wouldn't have written it. I don't believe in making fun of other religions,\" he said.\nThe TV host said he understood how people could have thought the musical had gone too far. \"You know, on our TV show if people use inappropriate language we bleep it out, if there's nudity we cover it up, so that viewers at home don't get to see any of this,\" he said.\nAsked whether he thought the BBC should have screened the controversial musical he said: \"I don't know if they should have had it on television but, good Lord, if you don't like what's on television, that's why God gave us remote controls. \"My show is about dysfunctional people and I defy anyone to watch the show and suggest to me the people on it aren't to some degree dysfunctional.\"\n\"If I did a show about the war in Iraq, it wouldn't make me a warmonger, I would just be doing my job to report on the war. \"In the case of my show, it's my job to report on the dysfunctions that take place in society.\" The British-born presenter is in London to speak at a fundraising dinner for the United Jewish Israel Appeal.

    "The next-generation DVD format Blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival, according to its backers.\nBlu-ray, backed by 100 firms including Sony, is competing against Toshiba and NEC-backed HD-DVD to be the format of choice for future films and games. The Blu-Ray Association said on Thursday that games giants Electronic Arts and Vivendi would both support its DVD format. The next generation of DVDs will hold high-definition video and sound. This offers incredible 3D-like quality of pictures which major Hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year. In a separate press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Toshiba announced that DVD players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005.\n\"As we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images, we have a much greater need for storage,\" Richard Doherty, from Panasonic's Hollywood Laboratories, one of the pioneers of Blu-ray, told the BBC news website. \"So by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today's DVD.\" A Blu-ray disc will be able to store 50GB of high-quality data, while Toshiba's HD-DVD will hold 30GB. Mr Doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs, including the ability to record onto the DVDs and smaller discs to fit into camcorders. Both Toshiba and Blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging DVD format war, akin to the Betamax and VHS fight in the 1980s, can be resolved over the next year when next-generation DVD players start to come out. When players do come out, they will be able to play standard DVDs too, which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current DVDs.\nBut the support from Vivendi and Electronics Arts is a big boost to Blu-ray in the battle for supremacy.\nGaming is a $20 billion industry worldwide, so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made. \"The technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies,\" said Michael Heilmann, chief technology officer for Vivendi Universal. \"Blu-ray offers the capacity, performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming.\" EA, a leading games developer and publisher, added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and Blu-ray had the capacity, functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. Sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of PlayStations. Mr Doherty said gamers were \"ravenous\" for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles. \"Gamers, especially those working on PCs, are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures, deeper levels, for delivering higher-resolution playback.\"\nHe added: \"The focus for games moving forward on increased immersion.\n\"Gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated 3D models and textures and increasing the resolution, increasing the frame rate - all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience.\" Fitting these models on current DVD technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost. As games move to more photo-real capability, the current technology is limiting. \"They are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments,\" said Mr Doherty. Currently, graphics-intensive PC games also require multiple discs for installation. High-definition DVDs will cut down on that need. Likewise, consoles rely on single discs, so DVDs that can hold six times more data mean much better, high-resolution games. Blu-ray has already won backing from major Hollywood studios, such as MGM Studios, Disney, and Buena Vista, as well as top technology firms like Dell, LG, Samsung and Phillips amongst others. While Toshiba's HD-DVD technology has won backing from Paramount, Universal and Warner Bros. \"The real world benefits (of HD-DVD) are apparent and obvious,\" said Jim Cardwell, president of Warner Home Video. Mr Cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with HD-DVD. Both formats are courting Microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation Xbox, but discussions are still on-going. Next generation DVDs will also be able to store images and other data. CES is the largest consumer electronics show in the world, and runs from 6 to 9 January.",
    "Elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans.\nMinisters say elderly and disabled people themselves, not social workers, should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes. They also plan a supremo for adult services in each English area to get different agencies working together. But the government shunned opponents' calls for free long-term care.\nThere are 1.7m people needing care in England and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by 2050. Monday's consultation paper on social care for adults in England is aimed at ending a system which generates dependency. Health Minister Stephen Ladyman said: \"This document is the antithesis of the nanny state.\n\"It's about taking power away from the state and giving it to individuals and saying that we will help you make these decisions but we are not going to make them for you any more.\" The government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but take-up of the scheme has been \"disappointing\".\nMinisters say the new plans would make direct payments simpler and try to counter reluctance in some local councils to use the payments. They also want to set up a new \"half-way house\" where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that \"individual budget\". The scheme will be funded on existing budgets set until 2008. But Mr Ladyman said the plans could deliver savings in some areas, such as freeing up NHS beds and preventing illnesses. He ruled out free personal care in England - which is on offer in Scotland and Wales, saying it was \"unsustainable\".\nDavid Rogers, from the Local Government Association, said agencies were working together on the kind of innovation proposed by the government. And Tony Hunter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said the plans could improve dignity and well-being for thousands of people. But Age Concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle, but not in practice. Its director general, Gordon Lishman, said: \"Direct payments will not work if there are no services for people to choose from locally.\"\nThe Tories say people who pay for three years' long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives. Tory spokesman Simon Burns said more than 80,000 long term care places had been lost since 1997. \"After eight years of persistent change, dogmatic enforcement of regulation, and overbearing government initiatives - we need action, not a vision,\" said Mr Burns. The Lib Dems say they would fund free personal care by a new 50% tax rate on incomes over £100,000. Health spokesman Paul Burstow said: \"Promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share. \"But the risk is that independence can turn into isolation if the right support and care is not available.\"",
    "Michael Howard has dismissed fears from some Conservatives that his plans for £4bn tax cuts are too modest.\nHe defended the package, saying it was a plan for the Tories' first Budget and he hoped to be able to go further. The Tories on Monday highlighted £35bn in \"wasteful\" spending they would stop to allow tax cuts, reduced borrowing and more spending on key services. Labour and the Liberal Democrats say the party's sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. The Tory tax plan follows complaints from some of the party's MPs that Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin have taken too long to unveil the proposals. Now they have promised a figure but have yet to reveal which taxes would be targeted.\nTory backbencher Edward Leigh said the proposals were a step in the right direction but he told the Financial Times: \"I would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts.\" Interviewed on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show, Mr Howard said: \"It is perfectly true that I am being attacked on one side by people who think we ought to be promising much, much bigger tax cuts and spending cuts.\n\"On the other side, there are people who say we won't be able to achieve these tax cuts. \"I think we have got it about right.\" Mr Howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under Labour and Tory value for money and lower taxes. He added: \"I would like to be able to do more, and over time I am sure we will be able to do more, but at the start, we have got to recognise there is a limit to what we can do in one go, in our first Budget. \"I have got to be responsible about this.\"\nThe latest Tory plans came as campaigning for the election - widely expected in May - gathered pace. The Liberal Democrats launched their pre-election platform, with leader Charles Kennedy saying his party was the \"authentic opposition\", particularly on the Iraq war, council tax and university tuition fees. Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Vince Cable also branded the Tory plans as \"fantasy economics\". Labour hit back at the Tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator Alan Milburn accusing Mr Howard of producing a \"fraudulent prospectus\". The party on Tuesday challenged the Tories to publish the full report from David James, the trouble-shooter they asked to identify possible savings. But the Tories are in turn demanding that Tony Blair spell out which taxes he would raise if he wins the election.",
    "Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers, who is accused of overseeing an $11bn (£5.8bn) fraud, never made accounting decisions, a witness has told jurors.\nDavid Myers made the comments under questioning by defence lawyers who have been arguing that Mr Ebbers was not responsible for Worldcom's problems. The phone company collapsed in 2002 and prosecutors claim that losses were hidden to protect the firm's shares. Mr Myers has already pleaded guilty to fraud and is assisting prosecutors.\nOn Monday, defence lawyer Reid Weingarten tried to distance his client from the allegations. During cross examination, he asked Mr Myers if he ever knew Mr Ebbers \"make an accounting decision?\". \"Not that I am aware of,\" Mr Myers replied. \"Did you ever know Mr Ebbers to make an accounting entry into Worldcom books?\" Mr Weingarten pressed. \"No,\" replied the witness. Mr Myers has admitted that he ordered false accounting entries at the request of former Worldcom chief financial officer Scott Sullivan. Defence lawyers have been trying to paint Mr Sullivan, who has admitted fraud and will testify later in the trial, as the mastermind behind Worldcom's accounting house of cards.\nMr Ebbers' team, meanwhile, are looking to portray him as an affable boss, who by his own admission is more PE graduate than economist. Whatever his abilities, Mr Ebbers transformed Worldcom from a relative unknown into a $160bn telecoms giant and investor darling of the late 1990s. Worldcom's problems mounted, however, as competition increased and the telecoms boom petered out. When the firm finally collapsed, shareholders lost about $180bn and 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Mr Ebbers' trial is expected to last two months and if found guilty the former CEO faces a substantial jail sentence. He has firmly declared his innocence.",
    "Tottenham manager Martin Jol acclaimed his players for their patience in their 3-0 FA Cup fifth-round victory over a determined Nottingham Forest side.\n\"We had the initiative but it wasn't easy.

Robbie Keane, skipper for the night and scorer of the crucial second goal, echoed his manager's sentiments on the last-eight match. \"They're on a high, but we're confident and in the last few games we've played well and hopefully we can go there and get the win,\" he said.\nHe conceded the win over Forest, which included goals from Noe Pamarot and Mido, was not pretty to watch. \"It wasn't the best display but it's all about the result,\" the Irishman said. \"We knew it was going to be difficult with the conditions. The pitch wasn't the best but we still tried to pass it. \"We dug in and the gaffer said to us at half-time to keep being patient and that the goal will come.\" Forest manager Gary Megson conceded his team did not deserve anything after a poor performance. \"If you play like we did and concede two goals from corners you're going to have an uphill battle against a very good team,\" he said. \"If we defend in the Championship like we did we'll not get another point. \"We were organised but I felt at times we thought the system would be enough but we didn't look like scoring.\"",
    "China's efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005, state media report.\nThe curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a \"hard landing\" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be taking effect. Industrial output grew 15.7% in the year to October, down from 23% in February, and inflation slowed to 4.3% - although retail sales are still booming.",

    "A \"taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise\" on the EU is being used to lull the British public into a false sense of security, say the Tories.\nShadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram told MPs a new White Paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the EU constitution. His claims were denied by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who accused the Tories of \"running scared\" of debate. EU cooperation would help get better UK immigration controls, he argued.\nMr Straw used Thursday's Commons debate to launch the new White Paper on the prospects for the EU in 2005. Security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the UK took over the chairmanship of the EU in July, said Mr Straw. Africa and climate change would also feature highly. He said the UK was trying to ensure future EU budgets were limited to 1% of Europe's economic output and were spent \"where it adds most value\". Mr Straw promised to continue to ensure the UK's budget rebate, secured in 1984 by Margaret Thatcher, was \"fully justified\". \"We, like all other countries, have a veto on any changes proposed in this area,\" he said.\nMr Ancram condemned the document, which the Foreign Office says has cost about £2,500 to design, print and deliver. \"Isn't the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new EU to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election?,\" he asked. The Tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the EU constitution would make Europe easier to understand. \"The government, last week, had to publish a commentary of 500 pages to try and explain this 'easy and simple' constitution to the British people,\" he said. \"Who are they trying to kid?\" The proposed question for the constitution referendum is: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the Treaty establishing a Constitution for the European Union?\" The Electoral Commission on Thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. The government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006, with the Tories set to campaign for a \"no\" vote.\nMr Ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. The foreign secretary hit back by saying Tory attitudes to Europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade. Mr Straw argued cooperation with European partners could bring a \"level playing field\" on immigration and asylum controls. \"You are setting your face against all of these things,\" he added. For the Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell said the UK should not ignore the need to reform the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets, he argued. Sir Menzies was among those worried about plans, backed by the UK, to lift the arms embargo imposed on China after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Mr Straw said no decisions had been taken - Chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.",

The survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in Europe was low. The survey of consumers in the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands was carried out by consultancy group Capgemini. The firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of RFID technology. The tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number.\nMore than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that RFID tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. Fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that RFID tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. Ard Jan Vetham, Capgemini's principal consultant on RFID, said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about RFID before it would become accepted technology. \"Acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. \"With the right RFID approach and ongoing communication with consumers, the industry can reach this point.\" He said that the survey also showed people would accept RFID if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. The tags are currently being used at one Tesco distribution centre in the UK - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. They are also in use as a passcard for the M6 Toll in the Midlands, in the UK. Mr Vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that RFID tags could be read from a distance. He said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. At least once consumer group - Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering (Caspian) - has claimed that RFID chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. All kinds of personal belongings, including clothes, could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners, it warned.",
    "Charles Clarke says he has \"no desire\" to offer more concessions on his controversial anti-terror plans to get them on to the statute book.\nMPs voted in favour of the Prevention of Terrorism Bill after Mr Clarke agreed to key changes - but Labour's majority was reduced to 14. The Bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. Lord Strathclyde, Tory leader in the Lords, said ministers should expect it to be \"substantially re-written\".\nThe Bill proposes \"control orders\", which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. They would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against.\nOn Monday, MPs voted 272-219 in favour of the Bill after key concessions from Mr Clarke. The government earlier saw its 161-strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly rejected by the Commons despite the support of 62 Labour rebels. Mr Clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the Lords to ensure the most controversial control order, amounting to house arrest, would be imposed by judges and not politicians. Lord Strathclyde warned ministers that they should \"prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the Bill\". \"They should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and I think they should drop the most objectionable proposals, which are for house arrest.\"\nBut Mr Clarke told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he believed the changes he had made to the Bill to win over critics in the Commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the Lords. \"No Bill goes through Parliament without detailed consideration being made, but I believe that what I announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the House of Lords,\" he said.\n\"I have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the Bill.\" Mr Clarke's proposed amendment will be debated by the Lords on Tuesday without having been considered by MPs. The debate is unlikely to result in a vote. Speaking after the Commons debate, shadow home secretary David Davies said the bill had been \"clearly very badly drawn-up\" and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly. He said it would be possible to \"rescue\" the government and make the law \"tolerable\" by amending it in the Lords. \"The scope for miscarriages of justice is enormous,\" he told BBC News.\nMark Oaten, for the Liberal Democrats, said Monday night's vote showed the government had \"lost the confidence of all sides of the House\". He said: \"They need to rethink the bill, and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders, build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects. \"Unless there is a major movement, this bill is doomed to fail.\"\nBBC News political editor Andrew Marr said: \"I think that this is a bill in deep trouble. It's been unravelling in the House of Commons - it may unravel further.\" The government wants the new bill to pass into law by 14 March, when the current powers expire.",
    "Schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons - or social cohesion and democracy will suffer, says the education watchdog.\nIndependent faith schools were singled out by Ofsted chief, David Bell, for not doing enough to promote the \"wider tenets of British society\". Mr Bell said Muslim, Jewish and Evangelical Christian schools must be \"intolerant of intolerance\". Diversity \"certainly must not mean segregated or separate\", he said. Mr Bell's speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship - with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more.\nBadly-taught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by Mr Bell, and in a speech to the Hansard Society, he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy, public service and shared values. He highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools - which he said included about 100 Muslim, 100 Evangelical Christian and 50 Jewish schools.\nMr Bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a \"common heritage\" and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion. \"I worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British society,\" said Mr Bell. The Ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to Muslim schools. \"Many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in England and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony.\" Mr Bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were \"tricky issues\". But he argued that \"we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation\". \"I would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as British citizens, equal under the law, should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance, illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community, be they women or people living in non-traditional relationships,\" said Mr Bell.",
    "The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.\nThe £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be \"worth waiting for\". \"It will be like nothing they have ever seen before.\" \"I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time,\" added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.\n\"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada,\" said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. \"We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London.\" Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.\n\"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions,\" assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. \"The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale,\" he said. \"Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth.\" New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.",
    "Re-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment, it has social benefits too.\nResearch has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide. The Forum for the Future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations. But the Forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites.\nThe report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the UK. Of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year, only 25% get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re-use. The slowly growing mass of unrecycled, discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets, the equivalent of 9,000 tonnes of waste, estimates James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future. \"It's quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around,\" said Mr Goodman.\nMany of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world, said Mr Goodman. Far better, he said, to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life. \"We've heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back,\" said Mr Goodman, \"but there's a strong social argument too.\" Older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model. The Forum for the Future report took an in-depth look at Romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular. \"It's an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network,\" said Mr Goodman, \"and there's a real desire for people to get mobile phones.\" But the relatively low wages in Romania, which is one of the poorest countries in Europe, mean few people can afford a shiny new phone. \"The affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one,\" he said. Reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of Romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets. The re-used handsets tend to be about one-third of the price of a new handset. Georgeta Minciu, a Romanian part-time cleaner, said: \"Normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages. I am a single parent - keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me.\" \"This is the only way I can afford to have a phone,\" she said. Mr Goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of Britain's mobile mountain made it overseas. But, he added, those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset. \"If its more than a few years old people are not going to want it,\" he said.",
    "An Austrian village is testing technology that could represent the future of television.\nThe people of Engerwitzdorf are filming, editing and producing their own regional news channel. The channel covers local politics, sports, events and anything that residents want to film and are prepared to upload for others to watch on PCs. The pilot has been so successful that Telekom Austria is now considering setting up other projects elsewhere.\n\"It's growing unbelievably fast,\" said Rudolf Fischer, head of Telekom Austria's fixed line division. The trial of Buntes Fernsehen (Multi-Coloured TV) was started in late 2004 and creates a net-based TV station run by the 8,000 residents of Engerwitzdorf. The hardware and software to turn video footage into edited programmes has been provided by Telekom Austria but this equipment, following training, has been turned over to the villagers. Any video programme created by the villagers is uploaded to a Buntes Fernsehen portal that lets people browse and download what they want to watch. Most people watch the TV on their home PC and a broadband connection is needed to get broadcast quality programmes. In the first four months of the project villagers have created 60 films and put together regular reports on local news items. \"They have adopted it very quickly,\" said Mr Fischer. \"They like the possibility to create their own content and see what's going on in the area.\" \"It's kind of the democratisation of local TV,\" he said, \"because none of the bigger broadcasters would ever do anything like this for that region.\" The Buntes Fernsehen project has been such a success that Telekom Austria is now considering setting up other schemes in similarly rural areas. Mr Fischer said it was taking the roll-out to other areas slowly because of the work involved in setting up the scheme, getting backers from local government and educating people how to make programmes. The Engerwitzdorf scheme is an outgrowth of Telekom Austria's online TV channel Aon which lets people watch programmes on their PC. Aon streams a couple of live channels, plus sports, news and music programmes on to the net and has a pay-for-download section that lets people watch what they want when they want to watch it. In October a larger TV-on-demand project is due to launch in Vienna that will let people download many programmes from the net.",
    "The trial of Bernie Ebbers, former chief executive of bankrupt US phone company WorldCom, has started in New York with the selection of the jury.\nMr Ebbers, 63, is accused of being the mastermind behind an $11bn (£6bn) accounting fraud that eventually saw the firm collapse in July 2002. His indictment includes charges of securities fraud, conspiracy and filing false reports with regulators. If found guilty, Mr Ebbers could face a substantial jail sentence. He has firmly declared his innocence.\nUnder Mr Ebbers' leadership, WorldCom emerged from Mississippi obscurity to become a $160bn telecoms giant and the darling of late 1990s investors. Yet as competition intensified and the telecoms boom petered out, WorldCom found itself under growing financial stress. When WorldCom finally collapsed, shareholders lost about $180bn and 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Mr Ebbers' trial, which is expected to last two months, is the latest in a series of attempts by US prosecutors to pursue senior executives for fraud. It will coincide with the retrial of former Tyco International chief Dennis Kozlowski and his top lieutenant, accused of looting the industrial conglomerate to the tune of $600m. Trail preparations are also preparing for former executives of shamed US energy firm Enron.",
    "Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said.\nHowl's Moving Castle set a Japanese box office record last week, taking 1.5bn yen (£7.7m) in its first two days. Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. Howl's Moving Castle is based on a children's fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones. It tells the story of an 18-year-old woman who ages dramatically after falling under a witch's spell. She heads to a moving castle kept by Howl, a wizard, and searches for a way to become normal again. A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film \"has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike\". \"We have a good feeling about this film. We saw very good viewer response,\" he added. The film's worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January.",
    "Microsoft is investigating a trojan program that attempts to switch off the firm's anti-spyware software.\nThe spyware tool was only released by Microsoft in the last few weeks and has been downloaded by six million people. Stephen Toulouse, a security manager at Microsoft, said the malicious program was called Bankash-A Trojan and was being sent as an e-mail attachment. Microsoft said it did not believe the program was widespread and recommended users to use an anti-virus program. The program attempts to disable or delete Microsoft's anti-spyware tool and suppress warning messages given to users.\nIt may also try to steal online banking passwords or other personal information by tracking users' keystrokes.\nMicrosoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software. Earlier this week, Microsoft said it would buy anti-virus software maker Sybari Software to improve its security in its Windows and e-mail software. Microsoft has said it plans to offer its own paid-for anti-virus software but it has not yet set a date for its release. The anti-spyware program being targeted is currently only in beta form and aims to help users find and remove spyware - programs which monitor internet use, causes advert pop-ups and slow a PC's performance.",
    "Black Sabbath have topped a list of the best British rock albums of all time.\nThe band once fronted by Ozzy Osbourne led a poll of Kerrang! magazine readers with their 1970 self-titled debut. The band have three more efforts on the list, including fifth-placed Paranoid. Osbourne appears more than any other act, with two solo records featured. The top five includes Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden and Sex Pistols. Queen, Muse, Manic Street Preachers and The Clash complete the top 10. A mix of heavy metal, punk, glam rock and even dance music makes up the list. Motorhead, Judas Priest and Prodigy are included along with newer acts like The Darkness and Lostprophets.\nKerrang! editor Ashley Bird said: \"It's amazing to see so many incredible homegrown albums in one list, and without any of the abysmal fashion bands that currently clog up the music scene. \"These are the real opinions of proper rock fans.\"\nFormed by four teenage friends in the West Midlands in the late 1960s, Black Sabbath are one of Britain's most successful heavy rock bands. Their debut was a UK top 10 hit in 1970 and sold more than a million copies in the US. Osbourne said the band's success in the Kerrang! poll was a triumph for British rock. He said: \"Back then you'd hear: 'If you go to San Francisco, be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. \"We lived in Aston, Birmingham. The only flowers I ever saw were on a gravestone in our local cemetery.\" Despite being disliked by many critics, Black Sabbath's subsequent albums included multi-million sellers but internal rows led to Osbourne leaving in 1979. The band continued without Osbourne, who went on to solo success but also had to battle alcoholism and legal action over his music allegedly inciting teenagers to commit suicide. He was eventually cleared of the charges. Osbourne, who bit off the head of a live bat on stage in 1982, rejoined the band to play the Live Aid charity concert in 1985. After many changes in line-up, the original four members reunited to play live dates in 1997. Black Sabbath have reunited regularly in recent years while Osbourne has gone on to wider fame with his family through MTV documentary series The Osbournes.",
    "Former captain Keith Wood believes Ireland can win only their second Grand Slam - and first since 1948 - in this year's RBS Six Nations Championship.\nAfter claiming their first Triple Crown for 19 years last season, Wood tips his former team-mates to go one better. \"Things have been building up over the past few years and I think this is the year for Ireland,\" he told BBC Sport. \"There is a great chance to win a Grand Slam. A lot of things are in our favour with England and France at home.\" Ireland have finished runners-up three times, including last year, since the old Five Nations became Six in 2000, and not finished outside the top three in the past five years.\nDespite being without flanker Keith Gleeson, coach Eddie O'Sullivan has not had to contend with the sort of casualty lists that have hit England and Scotland in particular prior to the tournament. \"For Ireland to win it we need to stay relatively injury free, and fortunately we are one of the few teams that have done that so far,\" Wood added. \"It is going to be tough and we need to take all the luck and opportunities that come our way.\" Ireland's last game of the tournament is against Wales in Cardiff - a fixture they have not lost since 1983.\nBut despite their traditional hospitality when the Irish are visiting, Wood believes Wales might end their four-match losing run against England in Cardiff. \"So many of the major England players have either retired in the last year or are injured that I think it will be very hard for them down in Cardiff,\" Wood added. \"Wales have had four brilliant games in the last year or so and lost all four, so the time is right for them now to beat one of the major teams.\"",
    "Tim Henman's decision to quit Davis Cup tennis has left the British team with a gargantuan void to fill.\nThe world number seven is tied for fourth among his countrymen for wins in the history of the tournament (he has 36 from his 50 rubbers). And Great Britain's last Davis Cup win without Henman came against Slovenia as far back as 1996. Worse could follow, according to former British team member Chris Bailey. Bailey told BBC Sport: \"After Tim's announcement, I doubt Greg Rusedski will be that far behind him.\" But without their top two, where does that leave British ambitions in the sport's premier team event? Captain Jeremy Bates has singled out Alex Bogdanovic and Andrew Murray as potential replacements. The Yugoslavian-born Bogdanovic, though, is 184 places below Henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties - winning one and losing the other.\nMurray, on the other hand, is 407th in the current ATP entry list and yet to make his cup debut. But Bailey does see some hope for the future. He said: \"Now we've dropped down to the Euro-Africa zone, the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore.\" Britain's next opponents, Israel, are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the 4-6 March match against a likely trio of Bogdanovic, Murray and the 187th-ranked Arvind Parmar. Bailey said: \"It will be tough for GB to move up, but there comes a time when our young players have to step up. This was always going to be inevitable with Tim and Greg's growing years. \"I'm confident about the future. I wouldn't lay money on us getting back into the world group next year, but I'd imagine in five years time we'll be competing for the major honours.\" Of those lining up to replace Henman, the 17-year-old Murray, with four Futures titles under his belt last year, looks the best long-term bet. \"Murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over Tim's mantle,\" said Bailey. \"He has an enormous amount of self-confidence, judging by what he's said in the past.\" Bogdanovic, three years Murray's senior, has had a more troubled time under Britain's Davis Cup umbrella.\nWhile Murray has been marked out as Britain's golden boy, Bogdanovic was warned by the Lawn Tennis Association for a lack of drive at the end of 2003. And Bailey said: \"Despite that, Alex is clearly talented as well, while Arvind is another contender. \"They're among the guys who have experienced the intensity of Davis Cup tennis - whether as players or on the sidelines. \"The LTA has always done an exceptional job of ensuring that. \"Now they'll finally get to play regularly in the cauldron of the cup. And I'm confident that will springboard Team GB to greater success.\"",

    "The UK property market remains robust despite the recent slowdown, according to mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley and housebuilder George Wimpey.\nB&B said the buy-to-let market - in which the bank is a major player - would continue to grow much faster than the wider mortgage market. The comments came as it reported a 6% rise in profits to £280.2m ($532m). Wimpey reported a 19% rise in profits to £450.7m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected.\nRecent housing market surveys have indicated that the UK property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth. Last week, figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) indicated that the popularity of buy-to-let mortgages - a key phenomenon of the housing boom - could be waning.\nBut B&B - which has a 22% share of the UK buy-to-let mortgage market - said that while rates of growth were moderating, the sector \"continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market\". Overall, B&B said that \"housing market fundamentals remain strong\". \"Interest rates and unemployment are both likely to remain at historically low levels, real household incomes should continue to grow and housing demand is likely to outstrip supply into the medium-term.\" Despite the upbeat tone, shares in B&B were down more than 4% at 325.5p in morning trade as analysts worried over future earnings growth.\nWimpey's profit figures came in at the top of expectations, with the numbers helped by buoyant sales in the US offsetting a slight slowdown in the UK. Wimpey said the UK housing market had proved \"challenging\" last year. \"By late summer, the market in general had slowed sharply across the country and showed no real improvement during the autumn,\" it added. However, the first seven weeks of this year had produced promising signs, Wimpey said. \"Visitor levels and interest in this period have been encouraging and reservations have been at the stronger end of our expectations.\" Shares in Wimpey were up 6% at 458.5p in morning trade.",
    "Local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.\nParty leader Michael Howard said the new role would replace \"inconspicuous\" police authorities. He said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. The Lib Dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing, while Labour criticised \"extravagant\" Tory promises on policing.\nResponding to the plans, the chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents rank and file officers, said it was essential operational independence was retained.\nJan Berry said: \"It is a service, not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches. \"These plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground,\" she warned. Outlining his crime manifesto, Mr Howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates. \"The commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"The trouble is, and it's no reflection on the people who are on the police authority - they are good people - but hardly anyone knows who they are.\" Mr Howard said the authorities were not \"providing the local accountability that we want to see\" and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.\nCritics fear the move could hand control of the police to single-issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community. Lord Harris, who sits on the executive of Association of Police Authorities, said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician. \"That is overturning nearly 200 years of the way in which we have organised policing in this country to avoid the politicisation of policing decisions,\" he said.\nLiberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the plan was dangerous and \"could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials\". Mr Oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a \"minimum policing guarantee\" with their chief constables. A Labour Party spokesman criticised Michael Howard's record, saying police numbers had fallen by 1,132 when he was home secretary. He said: \"Today the Tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them, other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system.\" The Tories insists the commissioner role would not be like that of an American sheriff. Other Tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences.",
    "Jolanda Ceplak has urged Britain's Kelly Holmes to continue competing at the major championships.\nDouble Olympic gold medallist Holmes has strongly hinted she will not run in this year's Worlds and is undecided about next month's European Indoors. But World Indoor 800m record holder Ceplak said: \"There is never an easy race when she is in the field. There is only excitement at what might happen. \"It is good for the sport. She always fetches the best out of everyone.\" Ceplak has been a great rival of Holmes' during the Briton's career and the pair fell out when Holmes questioned the manner of the Slovenian's runaway 800m victory at the 2002 European Championships. But the controversy has since been forgotten, with Ceplak acting as pacemaker for Holmes' failed attempt on the British Indoor 1500m record at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham in 2003.\nCeplak added: \"I like running against her - you know the race is always going to be fast. \"That is the sort of competition that I like. She is special to me. She was like my idol from the beginning of my career.\" Meanwhile, Ceplak will be looking to follow up last Saturday's win in Boston with a fast time and victory in Friday's Night of Athletics in Erfurt, Germany. Britain's Jason Gardener had been expected to defend his 60m title in Erfurt but instead he will save himself for a competition in Leipzig on Sunday. Gardener's decision means Scotland's 400m man Ian Mackie will carry British hopes in what looks sure to be a tough preparation for next weekend's Norwich Union European trials in Sheffield.",
    "Germany's unemployment figure rose above the psychologically important level of five million last month.\nOn Wednesday, the German Federal Labour Agency said the jobless total had reached 5.037 million in January, which takes the jobless rate to 12.1%. \"Yes, we have effectively more than five million people unemployed,\" a government minister said earlier on ZDF public television. Unemployment has not been this high in Germany since the 1930s.\nChanges to the way the statistics are compiled partly explain the jump of 572,900 in the numbers. But the figures are embarrassing for the government. \"With the figures apparently the worst we've seen in the post-war period, these numbers are very charged politically,\" said Christian Jasperneite, an economist with MM Warburg. \"They could well put an end to the recent renaissance we've seen by the SPD [the ruling Social Democrats] in the polls, and with state elections due in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, they may have an adverse effect on the government's chances there.\"\nThe opposition also made political capital from the figures. It said there are a further 1.5 million-2 million people on subsidised employment schemes who are, in fact, looking for real jobs. It added that government reforms, including unpopular benefit cuts, do not go far enough. Under the government's controversial \"Hartz IV\" reforms, which came into effect at the beginning of the year, both those on unemployment benefits and welfare support and those who are long-term unemployed are officially classified as looking for work. The bad winter weather also took its toll, as key sectors such as the construction sector laid off workers. Adjusted for the seasonal factors, the German jobless total rose by 227,000 in January from December.",

I want to get the ranking back, but it's very different than before I was number one. \"It was an obsession, but now I take it in a relaxed way.\" Mauresmo completed her first match in the season-ending championship in 54 minutes as Russia's Zvonareva struggled to return her serve and failed to achieve a single break point.\n\"She got mad a little bit and I played some great tennis,\" said Mauresmo, who was runner-up to Kim Clijsters in last year's final. Zvonareva has lost both her games so far, having crashed 6-2 6-4 Kuznetsova in the Staples Centre on Wednesday. \"Sometimes not everything works,\" she said. \"It was lots of pressure. Maybe that is why I couldn't do 100%. But I was fighting.\" Sharapova, who lost 6-2 6-2 to Kuznetsova in Beijing in September, said: \"In Beijing, she was coming off such a big winning streak [14 matches] and she was unstoppable. \"This time, it was important to start off well and put some pressure on her.\" The tournament debutant added: \"I love it here. The atmosphere is great. \"To be here where the Lakers play, you just feel that excitement. I love basketball.\" Williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days. \"It's hard to go out there and get it right but I'm fighting and I'm hoping,\" said Williams. \"What makes me happy is the effort. I had a really good effort today. \"I'm trying to add new dimensions to my game.\"",
    "A box set featuring 68 unreleased Nirvana tracks has gone on sale in the US, after years of legal wrangles.\nWith the Lights Out was intended to be released in 2001, to mark the 10th anniversary of the album Nevermind. It was blocked by Courtney Love, the widow of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, who did not want unreleased song You Know You're Right on the box set. The dispute between Love and surviving band members Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl was settled in 2002. Work began on the box set in 1998, but legal battles put the project on hold. The legal fight centred on a studio recording of the unreleased track You Know You're Right, regarded by fans as one of the unreleased gems of Nirvana. The set, released on Tuesday, features three CDs and a DVD of rare performance and rehearsal footage. The DVD also includes the first performance of Smells Like Teen Spirit, the track that launched Nirvana on to the international stage in 1991. \"The band wasn't always pretty, or always in tune. This is not Nirvana unplugged. It's Nirvana unedited,\" said Cobain biographer Charles Cross. The band's development ended tragically when songwriter Kurt Cobain committed suicide in April 1994.",
    "New safeguards on credit and debit card payments in shops has led fraudsters to focus on internet and phone payments, an anti-fraud agency has said.\nAnti-fraud consultancy Retail Decisions says 'card-not-present' fraud, where goods are paid for online or by phone, has risen since the start of 2005. The introduction of 'chip and pin' cards has tightened security for transactions on the High Street. But the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack, Retail Decisions said.\nThe introduction of chip and pin cards aimed to cut down on credit card fraud in stores by asking shoppers to verify their identity with a confidential personal pin number, instead of a signature. Retail Decisions chief executive Carl Clump told the BBC that there was \"no doubt\" that chip and pin would \"reduce card fraud in the card-present environment\". \"However, it is important to monitor what happens in the card-not-present environment as fraudsters will turn their attention to the internet, mail order, telephone order and interactive TV,\" he said. \"We have seen a 22% uplift in card-not-present fraud here in the UK... since the start of the year. \"Fraud doesn't just disappear, it mutates to the next weakest link in the chain,\" he said.\nRetail Decisions' survey on the implementation of chip and pin found that shoppers had adapted easily to the new system, but that banks' performance in distributing the new cards had been patchy, at best. \"The main issue is that not everyone has the pins they need,\" said Mr Clump. Nearly two thirds - 65% - of the 1,000 people interviewed said they had used chip and pin to make payments. Of these, 83% were happy with the experience, though nearly a quarter said they struggled to remember their pin number. However, only 34% said they had received replacement cards with the necessary 'chip' technology from all their card providers. Furthermore, 16% said that none of their cards had been replaced, while 30% said only some had. UK shoppers spent £5.3bn on plastic cards in 2003, the last full year for which figures are available from the Association of Payment Clearing Services (Apacs). Altogether, card scams on UK-issued cards totalled £402.4m in 2003. Card-not-present fraud rose an annual 6% to £116.4m, making it the biggest category even then. Within this, internet fraud totalled £43m, Apacs' figures show.",
    "Middlesbrough boss Steve McClaren believes his side can clinch a top-four spot in the Premiership and secure qualification for the Champions League.\nAfter their 3-2 win over Manchester City, McClaren said: \"We are playing exciting football, it's a magnificent result to keep us in the top five. \"But how well we do depends how often we can get our best team out. \"Once we got the third goal it should have been four or five but we nearly paid for it in the end.\" McClaren also praised winger Stewart Downing and strikers Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Mark Viduka, who both ended barren runs in front of goal. He added: \"If Stewart keeps playing like this Sven-Goran Eriksson has got to pick him. \"And the strikers scored great goals, the combination play between them shows they want to play with each other and they are trying.\"",
    "We Are The World, the American charity anthem inspired by the success of Band Aid, has been re-issued to raise money for Aids research and tsunami victims.\nMore than 40 stars sang as group USA For Africa, including Lionel Richie, Diana Ross, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen. It topped the charts in the US and UK, raising millions of dollars for African famine relief. The re-release also marks the 20th anniversary of the original recording. It has been re-issued as part of a two-disc DVD set, which will also feature footage from the recording session of the track in January 1985. The single was originally released in the US on 7 March 1985 and sold 800,000 copies in its first week. It went on to win Grammys for song of the year and record of the year.",
    "The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.\nStaff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered. US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.\nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand \"what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath\".\nAdding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate \"sickout\". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.\nUS Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.\n\"US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,\" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was \"embarrassed by the situation\" and \"deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,\" The probe will focus on the industry's compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair \"deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline's crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,\" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.",
    "Georgia is offering a one-off 'tax amnesty' to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president Eduard Shevardnadze.\nThe country's new president, Mikhail Saakashvili, has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay 1% in income tax. The measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost Georgia's flagging economy. Georgia's black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy.\nMr Saakashvili, elected president in January after Mr Shevardnadze was toppled, has urged the Georgian Parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible. It is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption, which was rampant during the Shevardnadze era, and boost Georgia's fragile public finances.\nThe new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 January, three days before President Saakashvili was elected. \"There are people who have money but are afraid to show it,\" the president told a government session. \"Documentation about where this money came from doesn't exist because under the former, entirely warped regime, earning capital honestly was not possible.\"\nBy declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax, people would be able to \"legalise their property\", Mr Saakashvili stressed.\n\"No one will have the right to check this money's origin. This money must go back into the economy.\" The amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering. Criminal investigations in such cases -thought to involve about 5% of Georgian businesses -are to continue. Mr Saakashvili has accused the Shevardnadze regime, which was toppled by a popular uprising in November, of allowing bribery to flourish. Georgia's economy is in a desperate condition. Half the population are living below the poverty line with many surviving on income of less than $4, or three euros, a day. The unemployment rate is around 20% while the country has a $1.7bn public debt.",
    "Charlie Bell, the straight-talking former head of fast-food giant McDonald's, has died of cancer aged 44.\nMr Bell was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in May last year, a month after taking over the top job. He resigned in November to fight the illness. Joining the company as a 15-year-old part-time worker, Mr Bell quickly moved through its ranks, becoming Australia's youngest store manager at 19. A popular go-getter, he is credited with helping revive McDonald's sales. Mr Bell leaves a wife and daughter. \"As we mourn his passing, I ask you to keep Charlie's family in your hearts and prayers,\" chief executive James Skinner said in a statement. \"And remember that in his abbreviated time on this earth, Charlie lived life to the fullest.\" \"No matter what cards life dealt, Charlie stayed centred on his love for his family and for McDonald's.\"\nAfter running the company's Australian business in the 1990s, Mr Bell moved to the US in 1999 to run operations in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In 2001, he took over the reins in Europe, McDonald's second most important market. He became chief operating officer and president in 2002. Mr Bell took over as chief executive after his predecessor as CEO, Jim Cantalupo, died suddenly of a heart attack in April. Having worked closely with Mr Cantalupo, who came out of retirement to turn McDonald's around, Mr Bell focused on boosting demand at existing restaurants rather than follow a policy of rapid expansion. He had promised not to let the company get \"fat, dumb and happy,\" and, according to Reuters, once told analysts that he would shove a fire hose down the throat of competitors if he saw them drowning. Mr Bell oversaw McDonald's \"I'm lovin' it\" advertising campaign and introduced successes such as McCafe, now the biggest coffee shop brand in Australia and New Zealand. Colleagues said that Mr Bell was proud of his humble beginnings, helping out behind cash tills and clearing tables when visiting restaurants.",
    "Top seeds South Africa return to the scene of one of their most embarrassing failures when they face the Seychelles in the Cosafa Cup next month.\nLast year Bafana Bafana were humbled in the first by minnows Mauritius who beat them 2-0 in Curepipe. Coach Stuart Baxter and his squad will return to Curepipe face the Seychelles in their first game of the new-look regional competition. The format of the event has been changed this year after the entry of the Seychelles, who have taken the number of participants to 13. The teams are now divided into three group of four and play knock-out matches on successive days to determine the group champions. Mauritius host the first group, and their opponents are Madagascar, the Seychelles and South Africa. Bafana Bafana play the Seychelles before Mauritius take on Madagascar in a double-header on 26 February. The two winners return to the New George V stadium the next day and the victor of the group decider advances to August's final mini-tournament. The second group will be hosted in Namibia in April. It comprises Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique and the hosts. In June, former champions Zambia will host Lesotho, Malawi and Swaziland in the third group in Lusaka. The three group winners will then join title holders Angola for the last of the mini-tournaments in August, where the winners will be crowned.\nSeychelles v South Africa\nMauritius v Madagascar\nWinners meet in final match\nMozambique v Zimbabwe\nNamibia v Botswana\nWinners meet in final match\nLesotho v Malawi\nZambia v Swaziland\nWinners meet in final match",
    "Hearts manager John Robertson hopes a place in the knock-out stages of the Uefa Cup could help keep some of his out-of-contract players at the club.\n\"It could help. If we get through and have another European tie it may encourage players to stay at least until the end of the season,\" he said. \"If we manage to get through it shows how well the club's progressing. \"They have to think whether they are going to get other clubs like that should they decide to move on.\" A win for Robertson's side against Ferencvaros would put them through to the last 32 if Basle fail to beat Feyenoord. \"It's very much the player's prerogative but the fact that we've been playing European football for the last three or four years is obviously an incentive,\" added Robertson. \"But we want players who want to play for the football club, who are committed and a run in Europe always helps a little bit.\" With the game being played at Murrayfield instead of Tynecastle because of Uefa regulations, Robertson sees both positive and negative aspects to the change of venue.\n\"The pitch is not in the greatest condition. The Heineken Cup game was there at the weekend and the pitch is a bit threadbare,\" he said. \"It's not ideal but it's the same for both teams so we just have to go out and there and perform. That's the most important thing.\" But he added: \"If Tynecastle could have hosted 30,000 it would have been fantastic but that's one of the benefits of Murrayfield - it allows us to bring even more of our supporters into it. \"There will be a good atmosphere and the Hearts fans have an important role to play. \"We need their encouragement, we need them to get right behind the side and make it as good an atmosphere as possible. \"Hopefully the players will respond to that and I know they will because it's a fantastic European night for the club.\"",
    "Belle & Sebastian have been named the best Scottish band of all time after a three month-long public poll.\nThe group beat Travis and Idlewild into second and third place respectively. Franz Ferdinand, who recently picked up five Brit Award nominations, ended up in 15th place, while the Eurythmics wound up at a lowly 38. Other Scottish acts, such as the Mull Historical Society who also featured in the top 50, performed at a party in Glasgow where the result was announced. Scottish-based band Snow Patrol, who finished 14th in the vote and have been nominated for a pair of Brit Awards, were among the performers who covered well-known Scottish pop songs at the party on Wednesday night.\nIndie stalwarts Belle & Sebastian have enjoyed a chart career stretching back to 1997. They were the surprise winners of the Brit Award for best breakthrough act two years later. Scottish bands from earlier musical eras also made it into the final list, including 1970s tartan boy band the Bay City Rollers and goth favourites the Jesus and Mary Chain.\nScottish magazine The List recently compiled a list of the top 50 Scottish bands of all time, but left the final decision to the public. The magazine's music editor Mark Robertson said: \"The idea behind the project was simple - to rediscover the very best of Scottish music, from the finest musical talent spanning from the age of 70s rock through to 80s pop, right up to today's international stars.\" \"Everyone has strong opinions about this and we wanted to open it up to the public to decide,\" he added. BBC Radio Scotland presenter Vic Galloway, who has been involved in the project, said it had been \"great fun\" to look back at Scotland's musical heritage and take note of up-and-coming Scottish acts.",
    "The head of Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, has criticised Britain's financial watchdog, the Financial Services Authority (FSA).\nIn a speech on Monday, Mr Prettejohn urged the FSA to force brokers to disclose the size of their commissions. \"The FSA should change, and change now\" said Mr Prettejohn, who wants it to move from \"disclosure on request\" to mandatory disclosure. The call came in a speech on improving the London insurance market.\n\"The FSA should not bide their time and 'wait and see'. They should seize the moment,\" Mr Prettejohn, Lloyd's chief executive said. The FSA took over regulation of the general insurance sector in January, but it sidestepped calls to require brokers to disclose the commissions they earn from insurers to their clients. Last week, the City watchdog gave brokers and insurers guidance on managing conflicts of interest. Brokers must give information on their commissions if, and only if, their customers request it, the FSA said.\nIn the US, lack of transparency about brokers' commissions has led to problems. The world's biggest insurance broker Marsh & McLennan said last week it would pay $850m to settle charges, raised by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in October, that it sought to rig bids in conjunction with insurers. The probe centred around so-called contingent commissions, whereby brokers were rewarded according to how much business they brought to an insurer, an arrangement that did not always benefit brokers' customers. All of the insurance business written in the Lloyd's market is placed via brokers.",
    "Dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, Media Labs Europe, is to shut down.\nThe research centre, which was started by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts. Since its opening in 2000, the centre has developed ideas, such as implants for teeth, and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. The centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. In a statement, Media Labs Europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the Irish Government nor the prestigious US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was willing to fund it. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies, in an attempt to regenerate the area.\nAbout three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the Labs' long-term survival. The Labs needed about 10 million euros (US$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. \"In the end, it was too deep and too long a recession,\" said Simon Jones, the Labs' managing director. Ian Pearson, BT's futurologist, told the BBC News website that the closure was a \"real shame\". BT was just one of the companies that had worked with the Labs, looking at RFID tag developments and video conferencing. \"There were a lot of very talented, creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society. \"I have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost.\"\nNoel Dempsey, the government's communications minister, said Mr Ahern had been \"very committed\" to the project. \"He is, I know, very disappointed it has come to this. At the time it seemed to be the right thing to do,\" he said. \"Unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate.\"\nDuring its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. In recent months, 14 patent applications had been filed by the Labs. Many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. Several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. The Human Connectedness group, for example, developed the iBand, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. This information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. Other projects looked at using other human senses, like touch, to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment, or on the body itself. One project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. The Labs, set up in an old Guinness brewery, housed around 100 people, made up of staff, researchers, students, collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. It is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the Labs close on 1 February. According to its latest accounts, Media Lab Europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about US$10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million euros (US$3.3 million).",
    "US band REM have announced plans to perform for 10,000 Scottish fans in a rescheduled gig.\nThe band will play in what has been dubbed Europe's biggest tent on Glasgow Green on Tuesday, 14 June. They were forced to pull out of a concert at the SECC in Glasgow last month after bassist Mike Mills contracted flu. Fans who bought tickets for the original 22 February show can attend the rescheduled concert. The June gig will act as a warm-up for REM's open air concert at Balloch Castle Country Park, on the banks of Loch Lomond, four days later.\nPromoters Regular Music booked Glasgow Green as the SECC was not available on the most suitable date. Mark Mackie, director of Regular Music, said: \"It is fantastic news and it really shows REM's commitment to their Scottish fans that they are coming back to Glasgow for what will be a truly unique gig.\" The REM gigs will kick-start what promises to be a memorable summer for Scottish music lovers.\nGrammy Award winners U2 will play Hampden on 21 June while Oasis will also perform at the national stadium in Glasgow on 29 June.

    "Spain won the Davis Cup for the second time in their history when Carlos Moya beat the USA's Andy Roddick in the fourth rubber in Seville.\nMoya won 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead with only one singles rubber remaining. Roddick battled hard and had chances in the second set, but Moya's clay-court expertise proved the difference. Mardy Fish beat Tommy Robredo 7-6 (8-6) 6-2 in the final dead rubber to cut Spain's winning margin to 3-2. Spain's only other Davis Cup title came in 2000, when they beat Australia in Barcelona. This time they chose to play the final in Seville and the city's Olympic Stadium was revamped to allow for a record crowd for a competitve tennis event of 27,000 spectators. And the home fans gave vociferous support to their players, with 18-year-old Nadal and Moya winning both Friday's singles rubbers. American twins Mike and Bob Bryan gave the visitors hope with victory over Juan Carlos Ferrero and Tommy Robredo in Saturday's doubles. But it remained an uphill task for a US team far happier on hard courts than clay, and 1998 French Open champion Moya had too much for world number two Roddick. \"This has been incredible - the moment I've been waiting for for years,\" said Moya, who missed out in 2000 through injury. \"I've prepared myself for this day. I knew that playing on clay I would have my chances to win.\n\"The Davis Cup is my dream. I can't ask for more. There is nothing bigger than what I've lived today.\" Moya stormed into a 4-0 lead on his way to taking the first set against Roddick and recovered immediately from dropping serve in the second. The match came down to two tie-breaks and Moya dominated both, clinching victory on his third match point. Wild celebrations followed, with an emotional Moya congratulated by his team-mates, including Nadal, who at 18 years and 187 days becomes the youngest ever victor in Davis Cup history. \"I think we put up a better fight here than in Paris two years ago,\" said Roddick, who was on the US team which lost to France in the 2002 semi-finals at Roland Garros. \"They were just better than us this weekend. I have nothing to be ashamed of, I gave it my all. \"I am not going to walk out of here with my head down, that's for sure. \"There's no miracle answer. We have to improve.\""

    "The former CEO of Worldcom, Bernard Ebbers, has claimed that he had no knowledge of the fraudulent accounting practices that led to the company's collapse. In his testimony during his trial, Ebbers stated that he had \"left the books alone\" and trusted his financial team to handle the company's finances.\n\nWorldcom, once one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world, filed for bankruptcy in 2002 after it was revealed that it had inflated its earnings by nearly $11 billion. The scandal sent shockwaves through the business world and led to the loss of thousands of jobs.\n\nDuring his trial, Ebbers maintained his innocence and argued that he was not involved in the accounting fraud. He claimed that he had delegated the responsibility of financial matters to his CFO, Scott Sullivan, and trusted him to handle the company's finances.\n\nHowever, prosecutors argued that Ebbers was aware of the fraudulent practices and had pressured his subordinates to manipulate the company's financial statements. They presented evidence that showed Ebbers had received regular updates on the company's financial performance and had signed off on questionable transactions.\n\nThe trial lasted for several weeks, and the jury ultimately found Ebbers guilty on all charges, including securities fraud, conspiracy, and filing false statements with regulators. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison, one of the harshest penalties ever handed down for corporate fraud.\n\nThe collapse of Worldcom was a turning point in the history of corporate governance and led to increased scrutiny of financial reporting practices. It also highlighted the need for stronger regulations and oversight to prevent similar scandals in the future.\n\nThe case of Bernard Ebbers serves as a reminder of the importance of holding corporate executives accountable for their actions. It also raises questions about the role of CEOs in ensuring the integrity of their companies' financial reporting. While Ebbers may have claimed to have \"left the books alone,\" the jury found him responsible for the fraud that brought down Worldcom.",
    "BT, the British telecommunications company, has announced that it will be offering free internet phone calls to its customers. This move is part of the company's efforts to stay competitive in the rapidly evolving telecommunications industry. \n\nBT's new offering, called \"BT Halo,\" includes unlimited calls to UK landlines and mobiles over the internet. This means that customers can make calls to anyone in the UK without incurring additional charges on their phone bills. The service will be available to both new and existing BT customers, and is set to launch in June.\n\nThe move by BT comes as more and more people are utilizing internet-based voice calling services, such as Skype and WhatsApp, as their primary means of communication. By offering free internet phone calls, BT is hoping to attract and retain customers who are increasingly turning to these services.\n\nBT is not the first telecommunications company to offer free internet phone calls. Many other providers, both in the UK and globally, have already embraced this trend. However, BT's entry into this market is significant given its position as one of the largest telecommunications companies in the UK.\n\nThis announcement is also aligned with BT's broader strategy of shifting towards internet-based services. The company has been investing heavily in expanding its broadband network and improving its infrastructure to support the growing demand for internet-based services. In addition to free phone calls, BT also offers a range of other internet-based services, such as high-speed broadband and television streaming.\n\nWhile the move to offer free internet phone calls is aimed at attracting and retaining customers, it could also have an impact on BT's revenue. The company generates a significant portion of its revenue from traditional phone calls. However, with the increasing popularity of internet-based calling services, BT is likely hoping to offset any potential revenue loss by attracting customers with the lure of free calls.\n\nOverall, BT's decision to offer free internet phone calls is a strategic move to tap into the growing trend of internet-based communication. By providing this service to its customers, the company is aiming to remain competitive in an industry that is rapidly evolving and adapting to new technologies.",
    "The UK government has announced that it will continue with its plans to introduce identity cards, despite growing opposition from civil liberties groups and some members of the public. Home Secretary Charles Clarke has defended the controversial scheme, arguing that it is necessary for national security and to combat identity fraud.\n\nThe ID card scheme, which was first proposed in 2002, aims to create a national database of biometric information, including fingerprints and facial scans, for all UK residents over the age of 16. The government argues that this will help to prevent identity theft and illegal immigration, as well as making it easier to access public services.\n\nHowever, critics of the scheme have raised concerns about the potential for abuse of personal data and the erosion of civil liberties. They argue that the government's plans amount to a \"surveillance state\" and that the introduction of ID cards will not effectively address the issues of terrorism or identity fraud.\n\nDespite these concerns, the government has remained steadfast in its commitment to the scheme. Home Secretary Charles Clarke has stated that the introduction of ID cards is a \"key part\" of the government's strategy to protect national security and combat crime. He has also argued that the scheme will provide individuals with a secure and convenient way to prove their identity.\n\nThe government has already begun a pilot scheme in which ID cards are being issued to foreign nationals in the UK. This has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising the increased security measures and others expressing concerns about the potential for discrimination and racial profiling.\n\nThe introduction of ID cards has also faced opposition from some members of the public, who argue that the scheme is an unnecessary intrusion into their privacy. Campaign groups such as NO2ID have been vocal in their opposition, arguing that the government should focus on more effective measures to combat terrorism and identity fraud.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the government remains determined to press on with the introduction of ID cards. It is expected that legislation will be introduced in the near future to pave the way for the wider rollout of the scheme. However, with opposition continuing to grow, it remains to be seen whether the government will be able to overcome the challenges and successfully implement its plans.",
    "The multinational agricultural biotechnology company Monsanto has been fined $1.5 million after being found guilty of bribery. The company, known for its controversial genetically modified crops and herbicides, was found to have made illicit payments to government officials in Indonesia. The bribes were intended to ensure smooth regulatory processes and the approval of its genetically modified cotton products in the country. The illegal activities, which took place between 2002 and 2004, were exposed by a former Monsanto country manager turned whistleblower. This case highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the ethics and practices of large multinational corporations operating in the agriculture sector. Critics argue that such companies wield too much power and influence over governments and regulatory authorities, enabling them to circumvent rules and regulations. Monsanto, now a subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical and life sciences company Bayer, has faced numerous controversies and legal battles over the years. This latest fine adds to the company's troubled reputation, raising questions about its business practices and corporate accountability. The bribery case serves as a reminder of the need for stricter regulations and oversight to prevent corruption and ensure that corporate entities operate ethically and transparently.",

In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Howard revealed that he would often skip school to indulge in his passion for the game. \n\nHoward, who served as Australia's Prime Minister from 1996 to 2007, explained that he would sneak out of school during lunch breaks and head to a local snooker hall. He confessed that he was \"hooked\" on the game and would spend hours perfecting his skills.\n\nThe former Prime Minister also shared that his love for snooker began at a young age when he watched his father play. He was fascinated by the precision and strategy involved in the game and quickly developed a talent for it.\n\nHoward's truanting days eventually caught up with him when his school discovered his secret snooker sessions. He was reprimanded and warned about the importance of attending classes. However, this did not deter him from pursuing his passion.\n\nDespite his dedication to snooker, Howard emphasized that he always prioritized his education and went on to achieve academic success. He studied law at the University of Sydney and later became a prominent lawyer before entering politics.\n\nReflecting on his snooker-playing days, Howard acknowledged that it was a form of escapism for him.

    "The British government has rejected calls for a shake-up of the royal succession rules, which currently prioritize male heirs over their older sisters. The issue has gained attention in recent years, with many arguing that the rules are outdated and discriminatory. However, the government has stated that it has no plans to change the current system.\n\nUnder the current rules, if a male heir is born, he automatically takes precedence over any older sisters in the line of succession. This means that even if a female heir is older, she would be pushed down the line if a younger brother is born. This has been a point of contention for many who believe that gender should not determine one's place in the line of succession.\n\nAdvocates for change argue that the current rules are not in line with modern values of gender equality. They argue that the monarchy should reflect the progress that has been made in society, where women have equal rights and opportunities. They also point to other European monarchies, such as Sweden and the Netherlands, where the rules have been changed to allow for equal succession rights.\n\nHowever, the government has made it clear that it does not see a need for change. They argue that the current rules have been in place for centuries and have served the country well. They also point out that the rules were changed in 2013 to allow for equal succession rights for future generations, meaning that any daughters born to Prince William and Kate Middleton would not be pushed down the line by younger brothers.\n\nThe issue of royal succession is a complex one, with many factors to consider. While some argue that the current rules are outdated and discriminatory, others believe that they are an important part of the monarchy's traditions and should be preserved. Ultimately, it will be up to future generations to decide whether or not to make any changes to the rules. For now, the government has made it clear that it has no plans to do so.",
    "Consumer confidence in the United States has risen unexpectedly, according to the latest data. The Conference Board's index, which measures consumers' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months, showed an increase to 129.2 in January, up from 126.5 in December. Economists had forecasted a decline to 125.9. This latest uptick in consumer confidence suggests that Americans are feeling more optimistic about the state of the economy and their own financial well-being.\n\nOne of the factors driving this increase in consumer confidence is the progress being made in Covid-19 vaccine distribution. With more Americans receiving vaccinations and the hope of returning to some sense of normalcy, people are feeling more positive about the future. Additionally, the recent stimulus package passed by Congress, providing direct payments to individuals, has likely contributed to the boost in confidence.\n\nThis surge in consumer confidence bodes well for the US economy, as consumer spending plays a vital role in its growth. When consumers feel confident, they are more likely to increase their expenditures on goods and services, which in turn stimulates business activity and job creation. The data also suggests that the US economy is showing signs of resilience despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nHowever, there are still concerns about the long-term economic impact of the pandemic, including the potential for further job losses and the slow recovery of certain sectors. Rising Covid-19 cases and uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of currently available vaccines could dampen consumer confidence in the coming months.\n\nOverall, the unexpected increase in consumer confidence is a positive sign for the US economy. As vaccination efforts continue and the economy gradually reopens, it is hoped that consumer confidence will remain strong, paving the way for a sustained and robust recovery.",

    "Jose Mourinho, the current manager of Tottenham Hotspur, has received a warning from former England manager Sir Bobby Robson. Robson's warning comes in light of Mourinho's recent comments about the dramatic injury of Spurs' midfielder Son Heung-min. \n\nMourinho, known for his outspoken nature, had made controversial remarks about Son's injury during a post-match interview.

    "A new poll conducted by the Institute for Soccer Decisions has shed light on the controversial free-kick decision that transpired during last week's match between rival teams, Manchester United and Liverpool. The poll sought public opinion on the referee's call, which resulted in a free-kick being awarded to Manchester United, ultimately leading to their victory. \n\nThe decision in question occurred in the 85th minute of the match, when Liverpool's defender was adjudged to have fouled Manchester United's forward just outside the penalty area. This led to a heated debate among fans and pundits about the fairness, or lack thereof, of the referee's call.\n\nThe poll, which garnered responses from over 10,000 football fans, aimed to gauge public sentiment towards the free-kick decision. The results revealed a stark divide among supporters of both teams. \n\nAccording to the poll, 62% of Manchester United fans agreed with the referee's decision and believed it was a correct call. They argued that the defender's actions impeded the attacking player's progress, justifying the awarding of a free-kick. On the other hand, almost 80% of Liverpool supporters surveyed disagreed with the decision, suggesting that it was unfair and biased towards Manchester United.\n\nThe poll also sought to understand the factors influencing fans' opinions. It found that supporters' loyalty to their respective teams played a significant role in shaping their perceptions of the decision. Manchester United fans, for instance, displayed a higher level of bias towards their own team, whereas Liverpool supporters were more inclined to perceive the decision as biased against their side.\n\nHowever, the poll did reveal some consensus among fans. Around 70% of those surveyed believed that the decision had a significant impact on the outcome of the match. This widespread perception reinforces the notion that contentious decisions can have far-reaching consequences on the outcome of a game and the subsequent implications for the league table.\n\nThe findings of this poll underscore the contentious nature of refereeing decisions in football. The sport has long grappled with issues of subjectivity and human error when it comes to officiating. While the poll sheds light on public opinion, it ultimately raises important questions about how such decisions are made and whether there is a need for reforms to ensure fairness and consistency.\n\nAs the debate surrounding the free-kick decision continues, both Manchester United and Liverpool will have to regroup and focus on their upcoming fixtures. However, this poll serves as a reminder of the enduring impact that a single decision can have on the emotions and opinions of football fans worldwide.",
    "A new computer worm named \"Santy\" has spread across internet servers worldwide, causing havoc by defacing numerous websites. The worm, which targets websites using the online bulletin board software called phpBB, has been responsible for altering thousands of web pages with the phrase \"This site is defaced!!! This site is defaced!!! NeverEverNoSanity WebWorm\" in bold letters.\n\nThe Santy worm has exploited a vulnerability in older versions of phpBB, which is widely used by individuals and organizations to run online forums. According to security experts, the worm searches for vulnerable websites and then infects them by inserting malicious code into their pages. This allows the worm to continue its rapid spread by infecting other websites that visit the compromised ones.\n\nThe extent of the worm's presence is enormous, with numerous websites being attacked within hours of its release. Experts estimate that thousands of websites have been compromised, with the potential for many more to be affected if proper security measures are not put in place. The situation has raised alarm bells among the online community, as the worm has the potential to cause significant damage and disrupt normal online activities.\n\nOne reason for the rapid spread of Santy is the popularity of phpBB. With millions of websites using this software, the worm has a large pool of vulnerable sites to target. Additionally, the holiday season has provided the worm with an opportune time to strike, as many website administrators may be on vacation or less vigilant in maintaining their sites.\n\nWeb security experts have been quick to advise website owners to update their phpBB software to the latest, more secure versions. They also advise implementing additional security measures, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, to prevent further attacks. Failure to take prompt action could result in a website being compromised and the potential loss of valuable data.\n\nThe Santy worm incident serves as a reminder of the constant threat posed by cybercriminals and the importance of maintaining robust security measures. It also highlights the need for continuous updates and vigilance to protect against emerging threats. As the online community comes together to address the Santy worm outbreak, efforts are underway to mitigate its impact and prevent future incidents of this nature.",
    "Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has praised the recent deal between Turkey and the European Union (EU) to resume talks on Turkey's potential membership in the bloc. Blair, who has been a vocal advocate for Turkey's EU membership, described the agreement as a \"positive step forward\" and a \"win-win situation\" for both Turkey and the EU.\n\nThe talks between Turkey and the EU had been stalled for several years due to various political and diplomatic issues. However, the recent agreement has paved the way for the resumption of negotiations, which could potentially lead to Turkey's accession to the EU.\n\nBlair emphasized the strategic importance of Turkey's membership in the EU, stating that it would strengthen the bloc's position in the Middle East and enhance its influence on the global stage. He also highlighted the economic benefits that Turkey's membership could bring, citing its large and dynamic market as a valuable asset for the EU.\n\nThe former prime minister acknowledged that there are challenges and concerns surrounding Turkey's potential membership, including issues related to human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. However, he argued that these issues should be addressed through dialogue and engagement rather than exclusion.\n\nBlair's support for Turkey's EU membership is not without controversy. Critics argue that Turkey's membership would pose significant challenges to the EU, including its size, cultural differences, and the ongoing Cyprus dispute. However, Blair remains optimistic about the potential benefits and believes that the EU should seize the opportunity to deepen its relationship with Turkey.\n\nThe resumption of talks between Turkey and the EU has been welcomed by both sides. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hailed the agreement as a \"historic moment\" and expressed his commitment to the EU accession process. EU officials have also expressed their optimism and hope for progress in the negotiations.\n\nThe talks are expected to cover a wide range of issues, including political reforms, economic cooperation, and the alignment of Turkey's legislation with EU standards. The negotiations will be a complex and lengthy process, requiring compromises and reforms from both sides.\n\nBlair's endorsement of the Turkey-EU talks deal adds to the growing support for Turkey's EU membership. However, the final decision on Turkey's accession to the EU rests with the member states, who will need to reach a unanimous agreement. Until then, the negotiations will continue, and the outcome remains uncertain.",
    "The United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) has long been a controversial presence in British politics. With its anti-EU stance and strict immigration policies, the party has been able to tap into a certain section of voters who feel disenfranchised by the mainstream political parties. However, in recent years, UKIP's popularity has waned, and they have struggled to make significant gains in elections.\n\nNow, UKIP's leader, Richard Braine, believes he has found the party's secret weapon to regain momentum - a focus on local issues. Braine argues that while UKIP's core message on leaving the European Union resonates with many voters, the party needs to expand its agenda to address concerns that directly impact people's lives on a daily basis.\n\nIn an interview with BBC News, Braine emphasized the importance of issues such as healthcare, education, and housing. He believes that by addressing these issues head-on, UKIP can broaden its appeal beyond its traditional voter base and attract a wider range of supporters.\n\nThe strategy seems to be gaining some traction, as UKIP has recently gained a significant number of local council seats in by-elections. Braine sees these wins as proof that focusing on local issues is the key to the party's success.\n\nHowever, critics argue that UKIP's attempt to rebrand itself and move away from the anti-EU platform is simply a desperate attempt to remain relevant. They argue that UKIP's core voters are mainly motivated by a desire to leave the European Union and that any shift in focus could backfire.\n\nFurthermore, with the Brexit deadline looming, some argue that UKIP's relevance may naturally diminish once the UK leaves the EU. This raises the question of whether a party dedicated to leaving the EU can survive in post-Brexit Britain.\n\nDespite the uncertainties surrounding UKIP's future, Braine remains optimistic about the party's prospects. He believes that by addressing the concerns of everyday voters and offering genuine solutions to their problems, UKIP can become a force to be reckoned with once again.\n\nAs UKIP continues to navigate these challenging waters, it remains to be seen whether their new focus on local issues will be their secret weapon or just another attempt to revive a faltering party. Only time will tell if UKIP can reclaim its former glory or if it will fade into political obscurity.",
    "The album of the year may not be an actual album, but rather the streets themselves. According to a recent survey, the streets have emerged as a surprising winner of the coveted title. With the ongoing pandemic, individuals have been forced to limit social interactions and find solace in their immediate surroundings. As a result, many have started to appreciate and explore their own neighborhoods, transforming abandoned streets into vibrant cultural hubs.\n\nIn cities across the world, empty streets have been revitalized by local residents, artists, and community groups. From impromptu art installations to pop-up markets, these previously overlooked spaces have become the backdrop for a range of activities and events. It seems that the streets are not just a means of transportation anymore, but rather a platform for creativity and connection.\n\nOne such example can be found in London's East End, where local residents have transformed their streets into outdoor art galleries. Painted murals and interactive installations have captured the imaginations of passersby and provided a sense of community spirit in these uncertain times. Similarly, in New York City, street-side dining and outdoor performances have transformed once-bustling avenues into lively cultural scenes.\n\nThe impact of these street transformations goes beyond mere aesthetics. They have brought people together, fostering a sense of belonging and creating a shared experience. With the streets being the common ground for all, barriers between communities have been broken down, and connections have been formed. These vibrant spaces have given individuals a sense of pride in their neighborhoods and ignited a renewed appreciation for their surroundings.\n\nFurthermore, the rise of these street culture phenomena has also had positive economic effects. Small businesses such as cafes, food stalls, and local artisans have flourished as they adapt to the new street-centric demand. Visitors and residents are actively seeking out these transformed street scenes, bringing much-needed foot traffic to struggling local economies.\n\nThe recognition of the streets as the album of the year serves as a reminder of the resilience and creativity found within communities. Though the pandemic has brought numerous challenges, it has also provided an opportunity for individuals to reimagine and reinvent their surroundings. As we navigate these uncertain times, perhaps we can all take inspiration from the streets' ability to adapt and transform, turning adversity into opportunity. After all, the album of the year may just be right outside our front doors.",
    "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised downwards its growth estimate for Germany, citing ongoing global uncertainties and weaker demand for German exports. According to the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook report, the German economy is now expected to grow by 0.5% in 2019, a significant cut from its previous projection of 0.8%. This downward revision comes amidst concerns over the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Germany, being the largest economy in the Eurozone, heavily relies on exports for its economic growth. However, weakening global trade and a slowdown in global economic activity have dampened the demand for German goods, particularly automobiles. The auto industry, which is a key driver of economic growth in Germany, has been facing challenges due to a decline in global car sales and stricter emission standards. These factors have contributed to a weaker-than-expected performance in the German economy. In addition, domestic challenges, such as a decline in business sentiment and ongoing structural reforms, have also weighed on the country's economic prospects. The IMF's revised estimate highlights the need for policymakers in Germany to implement measures to stimulate growth and address the external and internal factors impacting the economy. The German government has already announced plans to increase public spending and invest in infrastructure projects to boost economic activity. However, the IMF has called for further reforms, including reducing red tape and increasing labor market flexibility, to enhance Germany's competitiveness and ensure sustainable growth. The latest downgrade in Germany's growth forecast adds to the growing concerns about a global economic slowdown. Several major economies, including China, India, and the United States, have witnessed a decline in growth rates, indicating a synchronized slowdown in the global economy. The IMF has warned that escalating trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainties, and rising debt levels pose significant risks to global economic stability. To mitigate these risks, the IMF has urged policymakers around the world to work together to resolve trade disputes and implement structural reforms to boost productivity and investment. As for Germany, the IMF's revised growth estimate serves as a reminder of the challenges it faces in navigating through global uncertainties and maintaining its position as an economic powerhouse within the Eurozone.",
    "Nigeria, one of the world's largest cocoa producers, has announced plans to boost cocoa production in the country. The Nigerian government aims to increase cocoa production to 1 million metric tons by 2025, up from the current production of around 250,000 metric tons.\n\nThe move comes as part of the government's efforts to diversify the country's economy and reduce its dependence on oil revenue.

It will not only generate more revenue but also create employment opportunities for thousands of Nigerians, particularly in rural areas where cocoa farming is prevalent.\n\nNigeria's cocoa industry has faced challenges in recent years, including aging cocoa trees, low productivity, and the impact of climate change. However, with the government's renewed focus and support, the industry has the potential to thrive and contribute significantly to the country's economic development.\n\nThe government's commitment to boosting cocoa production aligns with global efforts to promote sustainable and responsible cocoa farming. Nigeria has already made progress in this regard by joining the Cocoa and Forests Initiative, a global effort to end deforestation and restore forest areas in cocoa-producing regions.\n\nAs Nigeria works towards increasing cocoa production, it is expected to strengthen its position in the global cocoa market. Currently, the country is the fourth-largest cocoa producer in the world, and with the right investments and support, it has the potential to climb higher in the rankings.\n\nOverall, Nigeria's plans to boost cocoa production are a positive step towards diversifying its economy and harnessing the potential of its agricultural sector. With the government's support and the commitment of cocoa farmers, Nigeria has the opportunity to become a major player in the global cocoa industry and reap the economic benefits that come with it.",

    "The highly anticipated Crossrail project, connecting various parts of London, appears set to receive the green light from the government, according to insider reports. The ambitious infrastructure project, which has been in the pipeline for years, aims to transform transportation in the capital and alleviate congestion on existing routes. The Crossrail link is expected to provide a much-needed boost to the economy, creating thousands of jobs and generating opportunities for businesses along the route.\n\nUnder the plans, Crossrail will enhance connectivity both within London and to the surrounding areas. The new railway line will span over 73 miles and feature 10 brand-new stations, with interchanges at key locations such as Paddington, Liverpool Street, and Canary Wharf. The project is also set to include upgrades to existing stations, allowing for seamless transfers between different modes of transport.\n\nOne of the major advantages of the Crossrail link is its potential to reduce travel times significantly. Commuters will be able to travel from one end of the city to the other in just 35 minutes, offering a much faster and more convenient alternative to existing options. This improved efficiency is expected to attract more people to use public transport, thus curbing the use of private vehicles and reducing traffic congestion on London's roads.\n\nFurthermore, the Crossrail project is set to bring a range of economic benefits. In addition to the creation of an estimated 55,000 full-time jobs during the construction phase, the completed railway line will provide employment opportunities across various sectors. It will also facilitate business growth, as the improved connectivity is predicted to increase trade and investment in the areas surrounding the new stations.\n\nHowever, the development of the Crossrail link has not been without its challenges. The project has faced delays and cost overruns, and its completion has been pushed back multiple times. COVID-19 has further impacted the construction process, causing disruptions and adding to the overall expenses. Nevertheless, authorities remain optimistic that the benefits offered by the Crossrail link outweigh the setbacks and continue to push for its approval.\n\nThe government's reported decision to give the go-ahead to the Crossrail project will be met with relief from both commuters and businesses alike. Residents of London have long been awaiting the improved transportation options that the new railway line promises, while businesses are eager to tap into the potential economic growth it is expected to bring. As plans progress, it seems that Londoners may finally witness the realization of this transformative transport project.",
    "Online games have become a popular form of entertainment for people of all ages. From casual puzzle games to immersive multiplayer experiences, there is a game for everyone. However, online games are not just about fun and entertainment anymore. They have started to play with politics, shaping the way people think and engage with real-world issues.\n\nOne prime example of this is the rise of political simulation games. These games allow players to step into the shoes of a political leader and make decisions that affect the virtual world they inhabit. Players can choose to be a president, a prime minister, or even a dictator, and navigate through complex political scenarios. These games provide a unique opportunity for players to understand the challenges and complexities of politics in a hands-on way.\n\nMoreover, online games have also become a platform for political activism and expression. In recent years, we have seen players organizing protests and demonstrations within virtual worlds to raise awareness about real-world issues. For instance, in 2019, Hong Kong protesters used the game \"Animal Crossing: New Horizons\" to stage virtual rallies and share their messages of democracy and freedom. This creative use of online games as a tool for political expression highlights the power of these platforms to bring people together and amplify their voices.\n\nFurthermore, online games have the potential to influence political opinions and beliefs. Through storytelling and immersive experiences, games can shape players' perspectives on various political ideologies and issues. For example, games like \"This War of Mine\" and \"Papers, Please\" explore the consequences of war and authoritarian regimes, prompting players to reflect on the ethical dilemmas faced by individuals in such situations. These games can foster empathy and critical thinking, encouraging players to engage with political topics in a more nuanced way.\n\nHowever, the intersection of online games and politics is not without controversy. Some argue that games should remain apolitical and purely for entertainment purposes. They believe that introducing politics into games can lead to polarization and divisiveness among players. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the potential for misinformation and propaganda to be spread through online games, further blurring the lines between reality and fiction.\n\nAs online games continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, their impact on politics is likely to grow. Whether it is through political simulation games, virtual activism, or shaping players' beliefs, online games have the potential to play a significant role in shaping the political landscape. As players become more engaged and aware of the political dimensions of these games, it is crucial to have open discussions about the implications and responsibilities that come with this new form of political engagement.",
    "Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger has offered former Chelsea striker, Adrian Mutu, hope for a return to professional football. Mutu's career came crashing down in 2004 when he tested positive for cocaine while playing for Chelsea and was subsequently banned for seven months.\n\nIn an interview with French newspaper Le Parisien, Wenger expressed his belief that Mutu deserves another chance. He stated, \"I have always defended the idea that a player deserves a second chance after making a mistake. Mutu is an exceptional talent and it's a shame to see his career cut short due to his off-field troubles.\"\n\nWenger, known for his ability to nurture and develop young talents, has had success with controversial players in the past. He notably took in Nicolas Anelka during his time at Arsenal, who had also faced multiple disciplinary issues at previous clubs.\n\nMutu, who is now 42, has not played professional football since 2016 when he retired from his last club, Pune City in India. Despite his troubled past, the Romanian forward has always expressed a desire to return to the game and has been training on his own to stay fit.\n\nThe former Romanian international was once considered one of Europe's brightest prospects, with successful spells at clubs like Inter Milan and Fiorentina. However, his career took a nosedive after the Chelsea incident, leaving him with limited options.\n\nWenger's support may provide the much-needed boost to Mutu's hopes of making a comeback. The Frenchman's reputation as a trustworthy mentor could attract potential suitors willing to take a chance on the talented but troubled striker.\n\nWhile Wenger's endorsement is important, Mutu will still have to prove himself on and off the pitch. It remains to be seen if any clubs will be willing to take a gamble on his reputation and offer him a contract. However, with Wenger's public support, Mutu's chances of finding a new club may have just improved.",
    "The highly anticipated annual budget, to be presented by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in Parliament on Wednesday, is expected to set the stage for a potential early election. As the Conservative government aims to deliver on its promises and regain public trust, this budget will undoubtedly be a pivotal element in their strategy.\n\nWith less than two years remaining until the next scheduled general election, it is widely anticipated that the budget will offer a glimpse into the government's plans and priorities, whilst seeking to secure public support. From crucial investments in infrastructure to measures aimed at addressing the climate crisis, this budget will determine the direction of the country for years to come.\n\nOne key aspect of the budget, likely to capture public attention, is the issue of taxation. Following the economic fallout caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, there are growing concerns about the UK's fiscal situation. The Chancellor will be tasked with striking a delicate balance between stimulating economic recovery and ensuring responsible public finances. Any changes to tax rates or the introduction of new taxes will undoubtedly draw both praise and criticism from various factions.\n\nAnother area of focus is likely to be the government's commitment to revitalizing public services and addressing social inequalities. With the NHS still grappling with the ongoing pandemic, it is expected that significant investments will be made to improve healthcare provision and support frontline workers. Furthermore, initiatives to tackle educational disparities, promote affordable housing, and create job opportunities are anticipated within the budget.\n\nIn what seems to be a bid to win public favor, speculation suggests that there may be measures aimed at bolstering the green agenda. As the UK takes center stage this year hosting the COP26 climate conference, the Chancellor could announce increased funding for renewable energy projects, incentives for electric vehicles, and initiatives to reduce carbon emissions. Such moves would align with the government's commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nPolitical analysts argue that this year's budget is not just about fiscal decisions but also about political posturing. It presents an opportunity for the government to showcase its vision and appeal to voters ahead of a potential early election. It will be closely watched by both political opponents and the public, as they analyze the government's measures, considering their implications and whether they reflect the promises made during the previous election campaign.\n\nIn conclusion, the forthcoming budget is set to have far-reaching ramifications and is expected to play a central role in laying the groundwork for the next general election. From taxation policies to investments in key sectors, the Chancellor is facing a challenging task of fostering economic recovery while responding to pressing societal needs.

    "The Conservative Party has announced its support for the reintroduction of identity cards in an effort to enhance national security and combat fraud. The move comes as part of the government's broader strategy to modernize the country's immigration and border control systems.\n\nThe proposed ID card system is expected to collect biometric data, such as fingerprints and facial recognition, to ensure greater accuracy in identification. By linking this information with individuals' personal data, the government aims to tackle identity theft and illegal activities more effectively.\n\nSupporters of the scheme argue that ID cards will not only bolster national security but also make it easier for individuals to access government services and prove their identity in various situations. They argue that this will help streamline processes and reduce bureaucracy, ultimately benefiting citizens.\n\nHowever, critics have voiced concerns about the potential infringement on civil liberties and the risk of a central database being hacked or misused. Privacy advocates argue that the collection and storage of vast amounts of personal data poses significant risks, as individuals' private information could be exposed or used for nefarious purposes.\n\nThe reintroduction of ID cards has been a topic of debate in the UK for many years, with the Labour Party unsuccessfully attempting to roll out a similar scheme in the past. This time, however, it seems the Conservative Party is determined to push ahead with the proposal and has won the backing of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nThe government plans to conduct a series of trials to test the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed system before a nationwide rollout. It is expected that the use of ID cards will initially be voluntary, but there is speculation that it could become mandatory for certain activities, such as opening bank accounts or accessing public services.\n\nThe reintroduction of ID cards is part of a broader strategy by the UK government to strengthen its position on national security and immigration control. With Brexit fuelling concerns about border security and rising levels of fraud, supporters of the measure argue that ID cards could be a crucial tool in safeguarding the nation's interests.\n\nWhile the government's decision to back ID cards may be met with mixed reactions from the public, it is clear that the issue of identity and security continues to be a pressing concern. As the debate unfolds, it remains to be seen whether the reintroduction of ID cards will be the solution the UK needs or whether it will raise new challenges and controversies.",

    "Online shopping for gifts has seen a significant surge in recent years, with the internet proving to be the preferred platform for shoppers around the world. The convenience of shopping from the comfort of one's home, coupled with the wide range of options available, has contributed to the boom in online gift shopping.\n\nAccording to recent research, a staggering 85% of shoppers now prefer to buy gifts online rather than visit physical stores.

    "Video game warnings need to be clearer to help protect children from potentially harmful content, according to a report by the UK's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

    "Brazil's government has downplayed the possibility of a rescue plan for troubled airline, Varig. The country's Special Secretary for the Brazilian Program of Privatisation, Francisco Gros, stated that the government does not intend to intervene in the airline's affairs. Varig, once one of Brazil's most dominant carriers, has been struggling with financial difficulties for several years. The ex-state owned company is currently operating under bankruptcy protection, but its future remains uncertain. The privatization program in Brazil, initiated in the 1990s, aimed to reduce the government's role in the economy and improve operational efficiency by selling state-owned assets. However, the government's reluctance to intervene in Varig's case could mean that the airline may not be able to secure the necessary funds to continue operations. Varig's financial troubles have not only affected the airline itself but also the Brazilian aviation industry, as it has caused disruptions in flights and affected passenger confidence. The option of a bankruptcy auction to sell the airline's assets remains on the table, but several potential buyers have already withdrawn their interest. The situation highlights the challenges faced by the aviation industry globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has severely impacted travel demand and profitability. With Brazil being one of the worst-hit countries in terms of COVID-19 cases, the future of Varig and other Brazilian airlines remains uncertain.",
    "The British Airports Authority (BAA) has gained support ahead of its legal battle to keep ownership of London's Heathrow airport. A group of British businesses have come together to voice their backing for BAA, warning that a change in ownership could have negative consequences for the aviation industry and the wider economy.\n\nThe support comes as BAA prepares to make its case in the Court of Appeal, following a ruling by the Competition Commission last year that the company should sell a number of its airports, including Stansted and Gatwick. The ruling was made in an effort to increase competition in the industry and address concerns about BAA's dominant position.\n\nHowever, the group of businesses, led by major airlines and tourism organizations, argue that a change in ownership would disrupt the running of the airports and cause uncertainty for both passengers and airlines. They also contend that BAA has made significant improvements to Heathrow in recent years, including the opening of Terminal 5, and that these improvements may be jeopardized if the company is forced to sell the airport.\n\nHeathrow is the busiest airport in the UK, handling over 75 million passengers annually. It is seen as a gateway to the global economy, connecting millions of passengers to destinations around the world. Any disruption to its operations could have far-reaching consequences for businesses and travelers alike.\n\nIn addition to the concerns about disruption, the group of businesses argues that a change in ownership could also result in higher costs for airlines, which could then be passed on to passengers in the form of increased ticket prices. They contend that BAA's ownership of multiple airports allows for economies of scale and better coordination between airports, leading to more efficient operations and ultimately lower costs for airlines and passengers.\n\nThe Court of Appeal is expected to hear BAA's case in the coming months. The outcome of the legal battle will have significant implications for the aviation industry and could potentially reshape the ownership and operation of major airports in the UK. In the meantime, BAA continues to rally support from businesses and industry stakeholders, highlighting the potential risks and negative consequences of a change in ownership.",

    " A lawsuit claiming Aaliyah's death resulted from negligence can proceed, but allegations targeting her uncle, Blackground Records founder Barry Hankerson, have been dismissed, according to court documents obtained by ABC News. \n\nThe singer's mother, Diane Haughton, and brother, Rashad Haughton, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in 2021 against Hankerson and others, alleging that Aaliyah's death resulted from a \"negligent pyrotechnic stunt\" that caused her to suffer burns during a video shoot in the Bahamas in 2001.

    " India has unveiled one of the most ambitious government budgets in history, with a focus on tackling poverty and boosting economic growth.\n\nThe budget, which was announced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, sets aside nearly $11bn for a new welfare scheme that aims to lift 20 million people out of poverty over the next two years.\n\nIt also includes a large increase in public spending on healthcare and education, as well as major infrastructure projects such as ports and railways.\n\nMr Jaitley said the budget was \"uniquely focused on transforming the lives of India's poor\".\n\n\"This budget attempts a lot of things for a variety of sections of society. That's why it is a progressive budget,\" he added.\n\nIndia is home to 1.3 billion people, with an average annual income of just $1,670, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe country has made huge strides in tackling poverty over the past decade, cutting the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day to 42 million, from 410 million in 2005.\n\nBut inequality remains a major problem, with the top 1% of the population owning more than 20% of the country's wealth.\n\nThe new welfare scheme, known as \"Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana\" (prime minister's rural housing scheme), aims to provide houses for the poorest families, as well as access to basic services such as water and electricity.\n\nMore than 19 million rural homes are set to be built over the next two years, with nearly $3,000 being provided to each household.\n\n\"This is a huge step forward for the government in its fight against poverty,\" said Rajiv Kumar, senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi.\n\n\"This budget seems to be all about addressing the needs of the poor and underprivileged sections of society. That's a very welcome move,\" he added.\n\nThe budget also includes a significant increase in public spending on healthcare, with the government setting aside $1.6bn for a new national health protection scheme that aims to provide affordable treatment for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nIn addition, the government announced plans to spend $14bn on infrastructure projects such as ports and railways, as well as boosting spending on education by $2.6bn.\n\nMany analysts had expected the government to announce tax cuts in order to boost consumer spending, but that did not materialise.\n\nMr Jait",

    " Councils prepare to set tax rises\n\nUK local authorities will today set budgets for the coming year, including increases in council tax bills for many residents.\n\nThe increases, on average between 5% and 5.5%, are the biggest in a decade following a decision by the government to allow councils to raise taxes to compensate for large cuts in central government funding.\n\nThe move has prompted accusations that Chancellor George Osborne is passing on the burden of cuts to households.\n\nThe government says it is giving councils greater financial freedom.\n\nThe increases vary across the country with some areas such as Dorset and North Yorkshire raising bills by as much as nearly 9%.\n\nResidents in Westminster, which includes the central London area, will face an increase of 7%.\n\nMeanwhile, half of Scotland's councils have set increases at or below the Scottish government's threshold of 3%, with some freezing charges.\n\nAre you happy to pay more?\n\nIn England, councils can increase council tax by as much as 2% without a referendum, plus another 2% if they promise to spend the money on social care.\n\nThey can also add a further 3% if they judge the finances to be unsustainable - a situation many authorities say they are facing.\n\nMinisters say the changes will give councils the ability to \"innovate and improve their services\", and come after a period of unprecedented cuts.\n\nBut the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils in England and Wales, has warned that services will have to be cut back even further unless the government provides more funding.\n\nIt says overall funding for councils will have been cut by almost 60% between 2010 and 2020.\n\nThe LGA's analysis also suggests that council tax increases for bands D and E - which are occupied by more than two-thirds of households - could be as high as 9.5% in some areas.\n\nIt describes the situation as \"dreadful\" and says it is unfair to place the burden on hard-pressed households.\n\nThe BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said that with just over a month to go before the Budget, the row over who pays for the public finances was heating up.\n\n\"The decision by many councils to put up taxes has turned what the government regarded as a good budget trick into a political problem,\" he wrote in a blog.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats said the increases were \"astronomical\" and would be a burden on millions of households.\n\nParty leader Tim Far",

Incoming calls can cost between 6 and 19 euro cents per minute.\n\nThere are also big differences in the price of outgoing calls from one country to another. For instance, calls from Greece to Germany cost 19 euro cents per minute, while the equivalent call from Germany to Greece costs just 6 euro cents.\n\n\"We will look at the abusive practices which unfortunately still exist in the EU mobile phone market,\" said Viviane Reding, the EU's telecoms chief.\n\n\"Roaming charges should not be higher than at home, nor should they remain high when volumes increase.\"\n\nThe investigation could take a year.\n\nThe mobile phone industry has already been hit by a series of EU rulings on the cost of roaming.\n\nLast month, the European Parliament voted for the complete abolition of roaming charges by 2015.\n\n Operators have also been forced to slash the cost of making calls while abroad.\n\nLast year, the commission ruled that operators would have to cut the cost of outgoing roaming calls by more than half, to just 3 euro cents per minute, by July this year.\n\nThis summer, EU officials will also begin examining the cost of texting while abroad.\n\nA recent survey by the British consumer group, Which?, found that UK mobile phone users were still often unaware that they were paying additional fees for incoming calls while abroad.\n\nLast year, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in the UK expressed \"serious concerns\" about the practice.\n\nOFT said the mobile phone industry had not done enough to inform customers",

    " New York (CNN) -- Nearly all the pilots of US Airways have agreed to a 15 percent pay cut, the airline's chief executive said Monday.\n\nCEO Doug Parker said in a memo to employees the agreement saves about $600 million a year and puts the company \"on a more viable cost structure.\"\n\nThe memo said that 94 percent of the pilots had agreed to the cut, and that management is working to get similar concessions from the airline's dispatchers, customer service agents, and managers.\n\nIn a statement, the Air Line Pilots Association said the pilot concession is a temporary measure, and that the union does not expect the airline to require such cuts in the future.\n\nThe union said the cuts were needed for the company's financial health, and that the pilot group was not optimistic about a recovery in air travel.\n\nUS Airways has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since September 2004.\n\nLast week, Delta Air Lines asked for wage and benefit concessions from its employees, saying its costs were higher than those of its competitors.",

    "Certainly, I can write the body of a BBC news article titled “Could Yukos be a blessing in disguise?”. Here is the article body:\n\nRussian energy giant Yukos announced it has filed for bankruptcy protection, prompting angry protests from the government. The bankruptcy announcement came after the company was hit with a $3.4 billion tax bill that it alleges was politically motivated. The Russian government has denied the allegations, and has said it will seek to have the company's assets auctioned off to help pay the tax bill.\n\nThe bankruptcy announcement has led to speculation about the future of the company, with some experts saying that the company could be on the brink of collapse. The Russian government has said it will do what it can to ensure the company's survival, but some experts have said that the government's actions may not be enough.\n\nYukos has been in financial trouble for several years, and has been struggling to pay its debts. The company has also been plagued by corruption scandals, with some of its executives being accused of stealing from the company. The bankruptcy protection will allow the company to continue operating while it works to resolve its financial issues.\n\nThe demise of Yukos would be a huge blow to the Russian economy, as the company is a major producer of oil and gas. The company's collapse could also have a negative impact on the Russian government, as the government relies on the company's taxes to help fund its operations. \n\nIt remains to be seen what will happen to Yukos, but the company's bankruptcy protection could be a blessing in disguise if it allows the company to survive and become a more stable and successful enterprise. Alternatively, it could be the final nail in the coffin for the already troubled company. Only time will tell.",

The sky's the limit as far as functionality is concerned,\" said Mr Higginson.\n\nOnline electrical retailer ao.com reported that sales of MP3 players with video capability had risen by 300% so far this year.\n\nThe managing director, Andy Haylor, said that the most popular brand was Apple's iPod, with the video iPod leading the way.\n\n\"The larger capacity the better, because you can store more music and video content,\" he said. \"We're also seeing the rise of the digital radio, with more and more consumers looking to tune in to digital radio, in the car and at home.\"\n\nBut the Gadget Show found that the MP3 revolution has also split the generations.\n\nYounger members of the same family were seen struggling to understand why their parents and grandparents were so fascinated by the devices.",

    "Sales of television sets have stalled in the UK as broadband availability improves, according to a recent study by regulator Ofcom.\n\nSales of TVs have fallen by 8% since 2019, Ofcom said, whilst the number of households with broadband increased by 7%.\n\nThe study did not provide a reason for the correlation, but it comes as households spend more time online.\n\nOfcom said that homes now have more devices capable of connecting to the internet than people, with each person owning on average 3.6 devices, up from 3.3 in 2019.\n\nThe study also found that nearly all households had internet access, with only 3% of households without it. This has increased by 1.2 million from 2019.\n\nOfcom said that the increase could be explained by the fact that most households who wanted broadband and were able to get it, now have it.\n\nHowever, it also showed that there were still areas where broadband was difficult to get, with some people struggling to get a decent connection.\n\nThe study also found that streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime were increasingly popular, with most households now having at least one such service.",

    "Clicking on the first link when you search for something on the web is probably not the best way to find what you're looking for. That's because it's not always a genuine search result. Instead, it could be an ad paid for by companies to make sure their service stands out.\n\nThese ads look just like regular search results. They often appear at the top of the page and are highlighted in yellow. And they come with a \"Sponsored\" label.\n\nBut a survey has found that many people still can't spot the difference.\n\nThe BBC spoke to Caroline Wilson, from Milton Keynes, who searched for a well-known government portal. She was surprised to find herself on a clone site which charged a fee. \"It was a redirect,\" she says. \"I was actually shocked, because I never expected that. I thought I'd clicked on the actual Government website.\" \n\nMs Wilson says she didn't notice the word \"ad\" written in small letters next to the link.\n\n\"If I had been looking more carefully, I would have noticed that. But I wasn't,\" she says. \"It was very subtle.\" \n\n Researchers at Cisco Systems carried out a survey to find out just how good at spotting these ads people are. They created several search terms linked to financial products, and used an iPhone, laptop and Android phone to conduct the searches.\n\nOverall, the researchers stumbled upon dozens of clone sites. In some cases, these charged a fee or got users to fill in forms with personal details.\n\nAmong the search terms they used were \"taxi insurance\", \"life insurance\" and \"government gateway\". They also searched for well-known brands, including M&S and Sainsbury's. In each case, the genuine websites appeared further down the page.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the average person would struggle to spot ads. In a worst-case scenario, this could result in someone paying money needlessly, or exposing their personal details.",
    "Aid agencies have insisted that Thursday's tsunami in the Pacific will not divert attention or resources from the humanitarian crisis in Africa. The 8.9-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami, which struck south-east Asia, have killed thousands of people and left many more missing. Aid agencies have launched appeals for funds to deal with the twin disasters. (£) This comes as Africa is battling its worst drought in four decades, which has left at least 11 million people facing famine in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia. The UN has appealed for $2.5bn to help more than 16 million people in the region. Mary Creagh, the shadow international development secretary, has urged British ministers to \"take a lead\" in providing aid for the African famine. \"The government must not allow the international focus on the Pacific earthquake and tsunami to distract from this horror,\" she said. At least 2,000 people have died and thousands are missing after the wave struck countries including Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka.",

    "Belle have been named the best Scottish band in a poll of music fans. The indie group, who are from Glasgow, topped The List's annual poll with an impressive 16% of the vote. Despite having a career spanning over 30 years, Belle have never performed or released an album. The four-piece, comprising Martin Keena, Gerard Black, Mick Slaven and Stuart Kidd, only play exclusive shows and private events. Speaking about the band, singer Mick Slaven told The List: “If you’d have told me when wee laddies that we’d be playing the biggest venues in Scotland, never mind be voted the best band in the business by readers of The List, I’d have laughed myself into next week. This is absolutely brilliant and just testament to the strength of the band, the musicianship, the songs and the performances.”\n\nSecond place in the poll was taken by Biffy Clyro, who have recently been nominated for the 2022 Mercury Prize for their album ‘The Myth of Happily Ever After’. The award-winning Scottish band were closely followed by Idlewild, who have been celebrating the 20th anniversary of their classic album ‘The Remote Part’. \n\nFranz Ferdinand, Texas, Simple Minds, Hipsway, Primal Scream, and Nazareth also featured in the top 10. Who have you been listening to this year? Are you feeling the Scottish indie or are you more of a global listener?",

    "There has been widespread speculation that Labour candidate Joan Collins, one of five women running for Westminster seats in Wales, may not be entitled to stand as an MP because she owns some land outside Cardiff Bay. The Labour Party says it will investigate the claims – and whether Collins should have resigned her seat if she had no ownership involvement in the property. But what evidence are we dealing with? BBC Wales asked South Wales Police why it did not take action against Collins over any possible offence on the rural grounds. A spokesman said nothing about any inquiry was under way. It is understood, however, that the investigation into Collins's ownership is considered separate to allegations about the house fire set accidentally when four men used ladders to gain access to a derelict cottage during a break-in in January 2000 – at which point they turned out to be two of Collins's lovers. The former leader of Swansea council's executive committee, Chris Lewis, told BBC Radio Cymru this week that he believed Collins should quit Parliament over what appeared to be a double standards problem as she owned land in Cardiff as well as at the same address. And on Tuesday, Labour MPs said they would launch legal proceedings against Collins after they were sent copies of an email allegedly written by a member of PCC Wylie, Ms Llanelli Williams, who served on Merthyr Tydfil's council between 1996 and 2005 before becoming deputy mayor under Michael Gove. (It alleged \"a man and his family\" living near an alleged seedy drug store run by Collins's lover was committing thefts – despite him being caught stealing at least three times.) A spokeswoman for Lambeth Council, where Collins is a councillor, described her recent conduct as ''totally inappropriate''. She continued: She is also facing charges relating to her alleged role as a prostitute. We can confirm Councillor Joanna Lumley did travel back to Merthyr Tydfil, but the allegation contained within is completely false. On Thursday PwC published its second annual report outlining why Welsh firms should be investing big bucks in emerging markets such as China. According to its figures just 0.2 per cent of the revenues generated in the region last year went to Welsh business. The report also stated there was likely to \"become the third largest economy in Europe after France and Germany\", but warned of a need to diversify away from heavy industries like coal mining – especially when Wales' share",

    "Boris Johnson today warned against giving young people \"the pretence that your personal ambition can outweigh anything else in society\". In an interview with BBC Newsnight presenter Evan Davis, the Mayor said being mayor was like \"playing at politics\", and claimed he would only do it again due to the scale of his achievements because other politicians are not prepared to give up their posts for him. Speaking alongside former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Mr Johnson said politicians' lives had become more difficult in recent years but added, \"I suspect this will be my life too.\" He said politics had got harder as governments cut spending, creating jobs became increasingly hard-won, and public services were privatised – creating opportunities for those who wanted to take on greater responsibility. The new Mayor of London praised Mr Brown – but was critical about another member of his party's cabinet. During his premiership Tony Blair failed to keep some key services running after they were turned over by New Labour, said Mr Johnson. But while Mr Wilson continued to \"take a great risk\" with education as Labour premier of Greater Manchester, there have been problems taking on the London Transport Authority (LTA) amid questions over its finances.\n\n\nNow I'm sure you must imagine it was Boris who said it and Gordon did respond that he too believes we should try to make the world better every single day. So what happened? First the British media blew it out of proportion and reported that Boris had complained that giving money away to kids was a waste because they wouldn't use it.\n\nWell guess what? If anything his comments showed exactly how important education actually is whether it's in the classroom or just around the house. Yes it may sound extreme until one really puts themselves in charge of funding our nation's schools then it becomes obvious very quickly. There is no point having a good school if it doesn't function perfectly and if it has to turn visitors off because they don't understand something. Why do most parents choose to send their children to private academies simply so it's easier to explain complex subjects to them? Education can be a major barrier for many families trying to support them in terms of getting into higher educational institutions which takes time and a whole lot of effort to help them succeed. What people forget when talking about schooling is that there are countless things we cannot control in our own home such as accidents, family disputes etc – both at home, where we spend hours",
    "A call has been made for an overhaul of Britain's state pension system, with one expert saying it was \"a disgrace\".\n\nProfessor John Hills, director of pensions at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said that while he did not think the current system was fair, there were other ways in which people could save money.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government should consider introducing a universal basic income - or a payment given unconditionally to all citizens regardless of their circumstances.\n\nProf Hills also called on the government to introduce a new way of calculating the amount of tax paid by each individual.\n\nIn his speech, Prof Hills said: \"I don't think we are doing enough to make sure that people have enough to live on and I do think that the state pension is a disgrace.\"\n\n'Unfair'\n\nBut he added: \"There are some things you can do about it. You can increase the age of eligibility for the state pension so that people who are older get more than they would otherwise get.\n\n\"You can change the way you calculate your tax bill so that people who earn less pay more tax than they might otherwise pay.\n\n\"And you can look at how you measure what you're paying for and say 'well, if we just take into account the value of the goods and services that people buy then we'll be able to give them a better deal'.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The state pension age currently stands at 65 for men and 66 for women\n\nProf Hills said that the government had already taken steps towards changing the state pension age but that these changes had not yet gone far enough.\n\nHe said: \"We've got to go further because the state pension age is going up again next year. It will rise to 67 for men and 68 for women. That means that people born after 1980 will start getting a bigger state pension than those born before 1950.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's unfair that people born in the 1960s and 1970s are getting a much larger state pension than people born in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\n\"That's why I'm calling for a fundamental review of the state pension age.\"\n\nThe IFS says that the average annual state pension in the UK is £1,300 per person, compared with £2,",

    "Labour has come under attack for its election campaign style use of anti-Semitic branding in recent days, with Jewish MPs and campaigners calling on Ed Miliband's party to apologise for using slogans such as Hitler would be proud of Labour and that only in Britain could it happen. One of the posters shown at last night's rally was captioned: \"Only in Britain would you see a woman being led out by her hair tied like cattle!\" It went up outside an East Dulwich hotel near Mr Miliband's home constituency of Doncaster South, with the tag line \"only in Britain\". In another example circulated on social media, there was a photo of two women in matching yellow Nazi uniforms alongside the message: \"only in Britain\" – apparently suggesting they were in attendance at something rather than just enjoying themselves.

    "In their first league game against Nottingham Forest he seemed to have already picked up his head injury when he collapsed and was helped off in the second half, leaving the centre-half unable to continue into the start of Saturday's home match against Leicester City. But Kewell will be examined on Monday when the Blues can call upon him as a temporary replacement to Jose Bosingwa after Chris Brunt got injured during City's Capital One Cup third round win at Derby County in midweek. The 27 year old has endured the worst injury luck of any QPR player this season but with Jamie Mackie limping around much like Chris Dagnall did before a horrific knee injury, Kewell could easily fill that gap if needed. After all it has been just three years since Kewell played for Rangers for the last time against Birmingham City back in May 2008 when he made an immediate impact in the 2-2 draw. He would go on to establish himself at Brentford where he enjoyed great success as well earning 3 England caps. More recently some key performances such as these kept him firmly in the spotlight again this past season while he was also very much involved in bringing many other younger talent through QPR's academy both domestically as well abroad including Dutch starlet Adriaanse (currently on loan at Norwich City) who scored 15 Premier League goals for QPR earlier this season and 17 appearances for Belgium U19s which include 3 caps for their senior side. His arrival at Loftus Road gives us hope about the direction this team is heading when they look more solid than they probably ever have before under the excellent Tony Fernandes taking charge. On Friday we watched Luke Young and Charlie Austin play for a short period of the game. With only Joey Barton between them the youngsters were impressive despite scoring no points with Austin currently on strike but both are part of what may prove to be a really good unit going forward and with Jack Robinson coming out of the game after injuring his hamstring Tony Fernandes has plenty of options in front of goal going forward, starting with a potential debut as early as tomorrow evening at Fulham.\n\nAdvertisements",
    "An email has been sent to all MPs and ministerial staff with an attached picture as a precautionary measure after two senior Conservative staffers died in tragic accidents while riding motorbikes yesterday. In the email, which also threatens further attacks on security measures for members and Tory MPs, \"Blackberry\" makes reference to several high profile incidents that have occurred at Westminster recently in which other party activists suffered serious injuries. The image shows former Conservative MP Michael Portillo being hospitalised last Friday amid fears he had broken his neck while trying to ride out demonstrators opposed to Gove's new schools policy or was having an epileptic fit and fell. He recovered but was immediately evacuated by ambulance from Buckingham Palace where he worked alongside David Cameron. On Sunday Mr Portillo's wife Mary appeared before MPs as she pleaded for them to take precautions against future violent threats. She told them about recent events including a firebomb attack in a south London pub that saw it set alight this month and another involving four people who were seriously injured after they tried to throw bricks through their neighbour George Galloway's front gate at a demonstration outside parliament. Ms Portillo said the most important thing MPs needed to do was to take sensible precautions; but she warned them not to \"get off their backside\".\n\nAs I've discussed previously, using a BlackBerry (the platform of choice by terrorists everywhere) for purposes such as sending messages to terrorist groups or \"planning actions or operations which could cause casualties among both British citizens and those living under the regime of the Islamic State group\" would be legal but illegal for everyone else. It does not appear at first glance that there is any mention in these emails of using this smartphone app while on Parliamentary business. However, in reality, once one understands what it does to secure user data it becomes obvious that BlackBerry Messenger can and should, under certain circumstances and conditions, serve a legitimate purpose while working for a political office like MP.",

    "British actress Emma Watson has been honoured as part of the Women in Entertainment Rising Stars Project, which honours women who have made an impact on American society to date. The award was given by Variety for her work in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\", and it came after Watson earned raves with her role in the last instalment on 12 May – or rather, before she showed up as a patron in October's Harry Potter finale. She played Hermione Granger, the head Ofsted inspector turned Hogwarts schoolteacher – a job that requires more than having an IQ score of 178! If she knew what was good for her before, what does she know now? According to an article written shortly after her performance, she believes herself to be better at cooking (\"I like everything with butter,\" she admitted), reading, and dancing than most young girls.\n\nIf you have read the story I presented earlier today in this blog (in light of previous articles entitled \"Emma Watson Reveals What We Can Learn From Her Role In 'Crazy Stupid Love' By Charlie Brooker\"), then you would know that British MP Louise Mensch claims publicly that the government's security apparatus monitors, electronically wiretaps, and spooks her phone calls from time to time using equipment created, installed, operated and maintained by the UK intelligence service MI6. It should surprise no one if some kind of spying operation targeted Emma Watson for surveillance while filming \"Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them\". So that's what we have here!\n\nSome people are claiming that \"Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them\" should not be seen as feminist propaganda but rather as a literary masterpiece that tells an original and moving tale about Newt Scamander and his wizarding friends exploring dangerous new territory within the wizarding world (which would, naturally, involve magical creatures). Other viewers see nothing wrong with sexism and anti-feminist sentiment within these films. After all, Rowling says that there's also misogyny in the books, because… um… men?\n\nWell before anyone can come to that conclusion, let me briefly point out that I am by none means defending any sexist attitudes that might have arisen from having grown up around JKR's fantasy novels. I'm quite happy to admit many mistakes made, although I feel it absolutely necessary when writing on something so politically sensitive to take great care never to suggest",
    "David Blunkett has apologised for his role in planning to kill former Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw, it emerged today. The former home secretary was killed by an IRA bomb in London in March 1997 and Mr Blunkett was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. He served two years in prison before being released on licence. In a statement issued through his solicitors, Mr Blunkett said he had been \"deeply ashamed\" at what he did. He added that he would never again be involved in such activities.\n\nIn other words, David Blunkett's apology is not about the fact that he was convicted of conspiring with terrorists to murder someone. It is about how he feels about himself.\n\nThis is the same man who once told the BBC that he felt like a \"piggy bank\".\n\nHe also claimed that he could have stopped the IRA bombing of Downing Street if he'd just gone to see Tony Blair.\n\nAnd now he says he regrets everything he ever did.\n\nI'm sure this will come as no surprise to anyone who knows anything about him.",

    "Scott Walker has been given a strong start to his campaign for president, with a new poll showing him leading Donald Trump by 12 points among likely Republican voters. The survey, conducted by Rasmussen Reports on behalf of ABC News and the Washington Post, shows that 42 per cent of Republicans would vote for Mr Walker if they could choose between them, compared to just 28 per cent who said they would support Mr Trump. In addition, Mr Walker leads Mrs Clinton by 10 points when third-party candidates are included.\n\nThis is not surprising at all. It's not like he was going to be able to win the nomination anyway.

    "Oleg Deripaska, convicted ex-KGB spy who survived a botched US attempt to have him extradited by Vladimir Putin's Russia last year, has claimed that his former colleagues secretly brought down oil giant Rosneft and Russian state gas firm Gazprom at the same time by giving \"a signal\". The suggestion is now being aired openly at a conference devoted to \"the new reality of international energy\".\n\nDeripaska said he believed the \"signal\" was something akin to the BP and Halliburton contracts which saw huge payments made towards buying out rival companies amid the 2008 financial crisis while also putting pressure on rival states for energy supplies.\n\n\nHe revealed what his sources told him about how that money flowed through a network to bring down both entities. The Russian-German businessman described the process as a massive conspiracy by \"well-financed\" groups within the Russian government, banks and energy sector in partnership with western countries. He provided no details or evidence as to where these sources might be found.\n\nThe timing of the claims and the fact that they appear to have been confirmed before Deripaska appears again is interesting – Deripaska appeared to have just come off television to give an interview suggesting he may not survive another trial for alleged tax frauds…\n\nRelated articles",

    "Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has announced plans to privatise state assets, including Ukraine's biggest bank Privatbank and its largest steelmaker Naftogaz. The president said he would use proceeds from the sales to help pay off debts owed by the country's two main banks, which have been bailed out with billions of dollars in international aid. Mr Poroshenko also said that he was considering selling the country's second-largest gas producer DTEK, which supplies about half of the country's electricity. He said he had not yet decided whether to sell the company or keep it as part of the state.\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report on the sale of PrivatBank by Bloomberg News:\n\nPrivatBank, Ukraine's third-biggest lender, will be sold for $1.5 billion to a group led by billionaire Rinat Akhmetov, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal could be completed within weeks, they said. It comes after the government last month approved a plan to restructure PrivatBank into three separate entities — one holding the bank's retail operations; another holding its investment banking business; and a third holding its real estate arm. The restructuring plan calls for PrivatBank to be split into two companies, one focused on retail and the other on investment banking. The new entity would be called Privat Bank Ukraina (PBO). The government intends to raise $2.4 billion through the sale of PBO shares, the people said. The government plans to issue up to $500 million worth of bonds to finance the transaction, the people said. The bond issuance would be financed by the sale of PBO shares, the people said. The government expects to receive at least $1.3 billion in proceeds from the sale of PBO shares, the people said.\n\nIn addition to the privatization of PrivatBank, the Ukrainian government is planning to sell its second-largest gas producer DTEK, which supplies about half of the country's electricity. This is an excerpt from a Reuters story entitled \"Ukraine to Sell Gas Producer\":\n\nUkraine is preparing to sell its second-largest gas producer DTEK to Russian energy giant Gazprom, a move likely to anger Kiev's Western backers who are demanding more transparency over how the deal will affect the price of natural gas flowing into Europe.

    "A new plan calling on the government to pay for a massive injection of cash into social care, including tens of billions extra over four years, was given its best chance on Wednesday when former health secretary Andrew Lansley unveiled his proposal before an audience of senior Tory MPs who had demanded he put down his pencil and follow up. The draft document which will form part of the coalition's forthcoming autumn statement will see the introduction of universal access to community medical centres (CMCs), as well as free personalised prescriptions at GPs' surgeries. In other moves, those aged 60 and above would be able to opt out of paying GP prescription charges from 2014. And the current system of funding care – provided by local councils based around clinical need rather than demand – could change under the proposals. A detailed set of recommendations on how to make life easier for people with limited or no money to buy medicines for themselves were presented in an 11-page white paper. Mr Lansley's group is considering including measures that will help hard-pressed patients, such as ensuring they get subsidised prescriptions so they can continue taking their medication without fear of a bill for it. Other areas being looked at include the creation of dedicated beds for children and disabled adults, free eye tests to prevent blindness, the provision of community care resources and information services and increased income tax concessions for some parts of society, such as older people. One Tory MP said Mr Lansley should have introduced the ideas sooner, but they wanted details about what sort of extra investment might ultimately fall across. He praised one proposed idea - called the Personal Healthcare Tax Offset (PHOTO) which will encourage households with incomes below £10,420 per year to purchase private medicine and use a special discount rate when picking it up. It has been floated by Liberal Democrat Vince Cable a month ago. But David Willetts yesterday rejected suggestions of such schemes and insisted there is plenty more to come next year. 'Nonsense': Tory MP Philip Davies told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he did not believe the PHOTO concept made sense \"At a time that we all share the view that we're struggling to deal with this issue comprehensively then it looks like nonsense,\" Mr Willetts added.",

    "A former employee of the Russian state-owned oil company Yukos has filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming he was forced to sign over his share in the firm's assets to the Kremlin after being fired for refusing to work on behalf of the company's owner Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The suit claims that Vladimir Yakunin, who was head of Russia's largest private gas producer at the time, and other senior executives were involved in the alleged scheme to force out Mr Khodorkovsky, who had been jailed by President Putin. It also alleges that Mr Yakunin used his position as an executive with Gazprom, the state-controlled energy giant, to pressure him into signing off on the deal. In addition to the $1bn (£640m) payout, the suit says, Mr Yakunin demanded that Mr Khodorkovsky be allowed to keep his stake in Yukos. He also allegedly threatened to cut off all financial support if he did not comply. The case is one of several brought against Mr Khodorkovsky since he fled Russia in 2003. His supporters say he was unfairly targeted because of his political activities. But critics accuse him of using the legal system to protect himself from prosecution.\n\nIn this case, it appears that the plaintiff is suing the Yukos subsidiary, which was owned by the Russian government. This would seem to indicate that the plaintiffs are seeking compensation for their losses due to the actions of the Russian government. However, there is no indication that they have any evidence that the Russian government was directly responsible for the actions of the Yukos subsidiary.\n\nIt should be noted that the lawsuit does not appear to be based upon any specific facts or allegations about the actions of the Russian government. Rather, it seems to be based solely upon the fact that the Russian government owns Yukos. If the Russians were somehow responsible for the actions of the Yukos subsidiary, then the lawsuit would likely fail.",
    "After six previous attempts, British artist Martin Scorsese won an Oscar this morning for his short film, The Age Of Innocence at the 88th Academy Awards ceremony, marking only the third such win by one nation alone – and in less than two decades. In 1997, Japanese-born painter Takashi Murakami took home the prize as part of Japan's artistic movement The Nipponese School. But even now, with all four countries represented, Britain has still yet to claim its first win in Oscars history. After a 12 year break since winning the award, American director Jim Sheridan bagged it once again for his drama Unbroken earlier this month. \"We've had a great time working together,\" says James Franco, who won best supporting actor for that same film. But while Sheridan had his eye on the Oscars after years in Hollywood without ever being given a feature or episodic TV script, it was Scorsese's film about teenage rape in the Italian city of Reggio Emilia which propelled him last night into international fame and left most of Britain standing silently in awe. Last January in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, British politicians condemned what they called the \"lunatic fringe\". Now all four countries were together for the first time, though the country at the forefront - America - couldn't have been happier to see their native son scoop the biggest award of them all. As ever, it came down to Scorsese and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. The pair had previously shown superb technique in Shutter Island – where Colin Firth and Kate Winslet found real intimacy in one another – but here they could be spotted dorking around on location outside the ceremony in a private plane – so if they'd done anything wrong, he wouldn't have known until afterwards. 'Towards us' In perhaps the most touching moment, Laura Dern (Gone Girl) told the crowd today she felt responsible for making a point to women everywhere how important films like The Artist could make them feel – and hoped more people would take the chance to find empathy.

    "The UK film industry has experienced a significant decline in production, with a 40% drop reported in 2021, according to the British Film Institute (BFI). This sharp decrease is largely attributed to the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has disrupted filming schedules and led to the closure of cinemas nationwide.\n\nThe BFI's annual report revealed that only 188 films went into production in the UK last year, compared to 314 in 2020, marking the lowest number since records began. The total spend on film production also fell by 21% to £1.3bn, down from £1.6bn in 2020.\n\nThe pandemic has had a profound impact on the film industry, with social distancing measures and lockdowns forcing many productions to halt or delay filming. The closure of cinemas has also led to a significant loss of revenue, with many films being released directly to streaming platforms instead.\n\nDespite the challenges, the BFI report highlighted some positive trends. High-end television production, which includes shows made for streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon, increased by 11% to a record £2.3bn. This suggests a shift in consumer behaviour, with more people choosing to watch content at home rather than in cinemas.\n\nThe report also noted that the UK film industry is showing signs of recovery. The number of films going into production in the second half of 2021 was almost double that of the first half, indicating that the industry is beginning to adapt to the new challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nBen Roberts, CEO of the BFI, said: \"Despite the significant challenges of the past year, the resilience and creativity of the UK film industry have been truly remarkable. We are optimistic about the future and believe that with the right support, the industry can bounce back stronger than ever.\"\n\nThe UK government has introduced a £500m film and TV production restart scheme to help the industry recover. The scheme provides compensation for productions that have been halted or delayed due to Covid-19.\n\nHowever, industry experts warn that the recovery will be slow and uneven, with many smaller production companies struggling to survive. They are calling for more government support to ensure the long-term sustainability of the UK film industry.",
    "In a significant development, no charges will be filed against the renowned television personality, Bill Cosby, according to the latest reports. The decision comes after a thorough investigation into multiple allegations of sexual assault against the actor.\n\nCosby, 83, best known for his role in the popular 1980s sitcom \"The Cosby Show\", has been at the centre of a media storm since 2014 when numerous women came forward accusing him of sexual misconduct. The allegations spanned several decades, with some dating back to the late 1960s.\n\nThe decision not to press charges was announced by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. They stated that in most cases, the statute of limitations had expired. In the remaining cases, there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime had been committed.\n\nThe District Attorney's office also noted that the decision not to charge Cosby should not be seen as a validation of his innocence or guilt. The decision was based purely on legal considerations and the available evidence.\n\nCosby's legal team has consistently denied all allegations, describing them as \"decades-old, discredited\" claims. They have argued that the accusations were part of a campaign to tarnish the reputation of the actor, who was once a beloved figure in American television.\n\nThe decision not to charge Cosby has been met with mixed reactions. While some see it as a failure of the justice system to hold powerful figures accountable, others view it as a vindication of the actor's claims of innocence.\n\nDespite the decision, Cosby's legal troubles are far from over. He is currently serving a prison sentence in Pennsylvania after being convicted in 2018 of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his home in 2004. Cosby has appealed the conviction, and the case is currently under review by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\n\nThe allegations against Cosby have had a significant impact on his career and legacy. Once known as \"America's Dad\", his reputation has been severely damaged, with reruns of \"The Cosby Show\" being pulled from syndication and honorary degrees being rescinded.\n\nThe case has also played a significant role in sparking the #MeToo movement, which has seen a wave of women coming forward to share their experiences of sexual harassment and assault, particularly in the entertainment industry.",

Britain's young hope was unable to match the 31-year old American's aggressive baseline play and precision serving.\n\nThe young Brit, one of the most touted talents coming from the UK, showed stellar performances in the junior circuits lately, but today, it was a learning curve as the American veteran showed him the real face of the professional game.

The team's relentless attack continued, and by half-time, they had extended their lead to 3-0.\n\nClyde FC, despite their best efforts, struggled to keep up with the pace set by their opponents.

    "After several months of a worldwide supply glut and decreased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, prices of crude oil have rebounded significantly. Global benchmark, Brent Crude, and the US standard, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), both sit convincingly above $50 per barrel, marking a significant economic turning point amidst a struggling world economy.\n\nThe WTI, more sensitive to the conditions of the US market, now stands at $52.25 per barrel, while Brent Crude, representing worldwide prices, stands at $53.75 per barrel, showcasing an unparalleled surge beyond $50 after months of deprivation.\n\nThis recovery in oil prices is significant as it reflects increasing confidence in global economic recovery and expectations of a potential uptick in demand as the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines engenders a return to a semblance of normalcy.\n\nThe oil price had plummeted in 2020 due to a drop in demand as numerous countries went into lockdown. The international demand for oil fell as airplanes were grounded, factories closed, and millions around the world worked from home.\n\nMarket analysts attribute this rebound to multiple factors. \"The introduction of vaccines uplifted the sentiments in the crude oil market, stimulating investors' optimism about future demand,\" says Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at Poten & Partners. \"Add in Saudi Arabia's surprise announcement to cut production by 1 million barrels per day in February and March, The U.S. economic stimulus and a weak US dollar, and we have a perfect recipe for an oil price increase.\"\n\nMany experts still remain cautious, warning that new variations of the virus still pose threats to the recovering economy and there is a potential for another price collapse. \"The current increase in prices should be viewed with caution until a consistent global recovery is in sight,\" warns energy analyst, Frederic Larson.\n\nNonetheless, the current surge in prices is certainly welcome news for oil producers and exporting countries, as well as industries reliant on oil prices. It provides a glimmer of hope for a fluctuating market that has taken several hits due to the global pandemic and a struggling world economy.",
    "The future of wireless internet connectivity is set to take a giant leap forward with the development of next-generation Wi-Fi technology, promising faster speeds, greater capacity, and improved performance.\n\nThe new technology, known as Wi-Fi 6E, is expected to revolutionise the way we connect to the internet, offering speeds up to three times faster than the current Wi-Fi 6. This souped-up version of Wi-Fi is designed to cope with the increasing demand for high-speed internet in our homes and workplaces, as more devices become internet-enabled and data-heavy activities like streaming and gaming become more prevalent.\n\nWi-Fi 6E operates on a higher frequency band than previous versions, which allows for faster data transmission and less congestion. This means that more devices can connect to the network at the same time without slowing down the overall speed. \n\nThe Wi-Fi Alliance, the global network of companies that drives the adoption of Wi-Fi worldwide, has already begun certifying devices for Wi-Fi 6E. This means that consumers can expect to see routers, smartphones, laptops, and other devices equipped with this new technology hitting the market in the near future.\n\n\"Wi-Fi 6E will bring remarkable improvements in wireless performance,\" said Edgar Figueroa, CEO of the Wi-Fi Alliance. \"It will support the growing number of connected devices, provide greater bandwidth for data-intensive applications, and pave the way for new innovations in technology.\"\n\nHowever, the rollout of Wi-Fi 6E will not be without challenges. The higher frequency band it operates on, known as the 6GHz band, is currently used by other services such as satellite links and radar systems. This means that regulatory approval will be needed in many countries before Wi-Fi 6E can be widely adopted.\n\nDespite these hurdles, the potential benefits of Wi-Fi 6E are significant. With the ongoing global pandemic forcing many people to work and study from home, the demand for reliable, high-speed internet has never been greater. Wi-Fi 6E could be the solution to this problem, providing a faster, more stable connection for everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may still be some time before Wi-Fi 6E becomes commonplace, its potential to transform our digital lives is undeniable. As we continue to rely more heavily on the internet for work, education, and entertainment, the arrival of souped-up Wi-Fi is a development that is eagerly anticipated.",
    "In a bid to clear his name, former Worldcom boss, Bernard Ebbers, has launched a vehement defense in the face of charges linked to one of the biggest corporate frauds in U.S. history. Mr. Ebbers denied all accusations, underscoring his unawareness about the $11bn (£5.7bn) accounting fraud during his time as WorldCom's CEO.\n\nStanding trial in New York, Ebbers pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy. If convicted, the charges could lead to a 25-year prison term for the 63-year-old. He is chiefly accused of being instrumental in inflating WorldCom's assets by about $11bn, eventually leading to the company's bankruptcy in 2002. \n\nIn his defense, Ebbers emphasised his lack of expertise in accounting. His lawyer, Reid Weingarten, echoed the claims stating, \"Bernie Ebbers never sought to mislead investors, never sought to improperly manipulate Worldcom's numbers, never improperly took any money and never sought to hurt the company he built.\"\n\nThe prosecution team, however, countered this defense by presenting former WorldCom financial director, Scott Sullivan, as their star witness. Sullivan, who pleaded guilty to his part in the fraud in 2004, testified that Ebbers had a clear understanding of the financial situation and was closely involved in the decisions leading to the accounting scandal.\n\nThe collapse of WorldCom was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. It cost around 20,000 jobs, leaving shareholders out of pocket by almost $180bn.\n\nWorldCom, now rebranded as MCI, has since been bought by telecoms giant Verizon. The audit failure at the company led to significant changes in U.S. regulatory laws with the introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, aimed at tightening corporate accountability.\n\nThe trial continues.\n",
    "Former UK Conservative Party leader, Michael Howard, has revealed that he used to skip school to play snooker. The confession came during an interview on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, where he admitted to being a \"bit of a tearaway\" in his youth.\n\nMr. Howard, who led the Conservative Party from 2003 to 2005, said he would often sneak off to a local snooker hall in Llanelli, South Wales, instead of attending school. He described his younger self as \"not a very good boy\" and admitted that his truancy was a \"terrible thing to do\".\n\nThe former Home Secretary, now 79, said he was \"captivated\" by the game of snooker from a young age. He recalled how he would spend hours at the snooker hall, honing his skills and trying to perfect his game.\n\n\"I was absolutely captivated by snooker,\" he said. \"I would spend hours and hours in the snooker hall when I should have been at school. It was a terrible thing to do and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\"\n\nDespite his truancy, Mr. Howard went on to have a successful political career. He served as Home Secretary under John Major's government from 1993 to 1997 and later led the Conservative Party, although he failed to win the 2005 general election.\n\nMr. Howard's love for snooker has not waned over the years. He is a regular at the World Snooker Championships in Sheffield and has often spoken about his passion for the game.\n\nDuring the radio interview, he also spoke about his early life, his political career, and his love for music. He chose tracks by Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and the Beatles for his desert island playlist.\n\nThe former Tory leader's confession about his school days has sparked a debate about truancy and the importance of education. While some have criticised Mr. Howard for his actions, others have argued that his story shows that unconventional paths can also lead to success.\n\nMr. Howard ended the interview by saying, \"I was lucky. I got away with it. But I wouldn't advise anyone to follow my example.\"",
    "England's football team is facing an escalating defensive crisis as key defenders continue to struggle with injuries and suspicesions. With crucial matches on the horizon, this raises alarm about the team's capacity to withstand the threat posed by fierce competitors.\n\nCenter-backs Harry Maguire and John Stones, known for their robust presence on the field and ability to thwart opposing advances, both face uncertain injury situations. Maguire's fitness has been in question since he sustained an ankle injury playing for Manchester United, while Stones suffered a muscle injury during training.\n\nMeanwhile, right-back Kyle Walker is one step away from suspension after picking up yellow cards in two consecutive games. The player's aggressive style, though often effective, runs the risk of leaving the team a man down in future matches. Furthermore, left-back Luke Shaw was sent home early from training due to illness, casting doubt over his availability ahead of crucial fixtures.\n\nThis string of unfortunate circumstances leaves England with a depleted defensive line. As alternatives, manager Gareth Southgate could delve into the inexperienced talents in the squad, like Tyrone Mings or Ben White. However, neither have the wealth of experience playing at high-stake international games that the likes of Maguire, Stones, and Walker can boast.\n\nSouthgate remains hopeful, stating in a recent press conference: \"It's always a challenge dealing with injuries and suspensions. However, we have a strong squad and fully believe in the ability of each player.\"\n\nDespite this optimism, there is no denying that the defensive crisis poses a significant challenge for England. With the European championship and World Cup qualifiers coming up, the team needs its defensive stalwarts not only fit but also in prime form to ensure a successful campaign.\n\nOnly time will tell how England navigates this situation. For now, fans and critics alike will closely watch how Southgate adjusts his tactics and line-ups to address this defensive crisis. One thing is for certain — with the stakes this high, England's defensive challenges can't be ignored.",

    "UK-based pharmaceutical company, MediPharm Labs, has expressed optimism over its latest foray into the use of cannabis for drug innovation following early breakthroughs. This news has sent tremors of excitement through the industry, hinting at an unprecedented leap in the use of the plant in the pharmaceutical realm.\n\nThe company has long been known for its pioneering strides within the biomedical field and now, it has begun to leverage the medicinal properties of cannabis to uncover new treatment pathways. This step is seen as a potentially significant milestone in the radical rethink of how plant-based substances can be utilized in drug creation.\n\nCEO of MediPharm Labs, Dr. Robert Hopkins, has praised the diligent work of his team of scientists who have already begun trials for a host of new drugs that harness the medically beneficial properties of cannabis. \"Our team has made remarkable progress in developing new therapies employing cannabis compounds,\" he stated. \"The progression of these proposed drugs into clinical trials signals a major advancement towards mainstream acceptance of cannabis as a powerhouse of drug innovation.”\n\nAs of now, much of the pharmaceutical industry has tread lightly in the realm of cannabis treatment. This is largely due to surrounding controversy and stringent regulations regarding its use. However, many drugs already have the compound CBD, a non-psychoactive derivative of cannabis, in their list of key ingredients. Credited with reducing inflammation and pain, CBD is also used for treating conditions like epilepsy, psychosis, and anxiety disorders.\n\nMediPharm Labs' recent moves have rekindled hope in the pharmaceutical sector regarding cannabis research. Following the announcement, the company’s stock rose by 7%. This isn't just a win for MediPharm but for suppliers and enthusiasts who support cannabis as an alternative to synthetic drugs.\n\nWhile some in society may remain skeptical, MediPharm is hoping that its groundwork in cannabis experimentation may help dismantle the stigma associated with the plant’s use in medicine. The company’s executive team is hopeful that the breakthroughs resultant from their research will cement their vision of cannabis as both a viable and potentially paramount player in the drug sector.\n\nHowever, it is not a clear cut path to success. Legal confines, rigorous testing criteria and funding issues still stand as hurdles that MediPharm Labs, and other companies venturing into this field, must navigate. \n\nAs MediPharm Labs continues its cannabis research, the world will be watching. The results could ignite not only a new industry trend but could also trigger a wave of legislative changes that may redefine the future of pharmaceuticals.

Typically, scammers send an email often disguised as coming from a credible source, like the domain registrar or internet service provider, to get users to reveal sensitive personal or financial data.\n\n\"Scammers have become advanced and are now able to make their emails and websites appear genuine,\" says cybersecurity expert, Mr. Thomas Moore. \"Those unfamiliar with such tricks easily fall victim, potentially causing tremendous financial loss and breach of personal information.\"\n\nExperts warn that the level of sophistication used by scammers has significantly increased over the past years. They are reportedly using similar sounding domain names, logos and even addresses of legitimate businesses to trick their victims.\n\nThe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which oversees the global domain name system, has also expressed its concerns. It claims that these scams are undermining the trust of internet users and threatening online transactions.\n\n\"As much as we are working hard to regulate the digital landscape, users need to be cautious about the emails they receive and the websites they visit,\" says an ICANN spokesperson. \"Not all issues can be solved technically, end-users being vigilant is equally crucial.\"\n\nIn addition to the financial losses, the rising numbers of domain system scams also pose a significant risk regarding data protection.

The marathon contest, called The Big War Game, pits thousands of players against each other in a virtual battle that spans the globe.\n\nTwo of the world's most popular war game franchises, \"Call of Duty\" and \"Battlefield\", are at the forefront of this enormous tournament. Matches are taking place online with players connecting from home or in some, cases, collective venues equipped with powerful gaming systems. The competition aims to crown the world's best military simulation team and also highlight the growing popularity of war-based video games.\n\n\"Cyber warfare has seen a significant rise in recent years and gaming is an integral part of it. The magnitude of this event reflects the global impact and interest that these games have generated,\" said Joanna Morgan, a gaming industry analyst.\n\nThe spectacle of battle commenced last weekend with hundreds of teams going head-to-head in virtual locales that are recreated from real-world conflict zones. From the desolate landscapes of Afghanistan in \"Call of Duty\"'s multiplayer maps to the sprawling cityscape in \"Battlefield\"'s \"Siege of Shanghai\", the games offer a sense of realism and adrenaline that has attracted a massive fan base.\n\nThe games are not just limited to these two franchises, as other games such as \"Arma 3\", \"World of Tanks\", and \"War Thunder\" also feature in the competition. \n\n\"These war games are more than just recreational activities. They stimulate critical thinking, tactical planning, and teamwork. They also serve as a cultural reference to global military history and contemporary conflicts,\" said Oliver Jackson, a professor of video game studies.\n\nBut while the games engage players with stunning graphics and intense gameplay, they have not been without their share of controversy. Critics argue that such games trivialize real-world conflict and warfare, desensitizing players to violence.\n\nIn response to this, many game developers and organizers of such events aim to balance gaming entertainment with an understanding of the realities of war. They encourage players to learn about the historical and geopolitical contexts presented in the games.\n\n\"By staging this competition, we're not just broadcasting our love for military strategy and action. We also want players and viewers to engage in dialogue about real-world conflicts and the impact of warfare,\" said Martin Turner, the organizer of The Big War Game.\n\nAs the games continue to rage on, players are digging into their arsenals, deploying strategies, and vying for supremacy in the digital battlefield.

    "In an increasingly digital world, the importance of writing secure and accurate code is escalating rapidly. With an array of sectors from finance to healthcare becoming dependent on coding, guidelines for ethical and professional behaviour in programming have become essential.\n\nThis article does not serve as a warning against the acquisition of programming skills. On the contrary, it underlines how essential these skills have become in the current job market. Coding has become an indispensable part of a variety of sectors, not just in IT but in education, marketing, analytics, and many more. However, as Spiderman's Uncle Ben once famously said, \"With great power, comes great responsibility.\"\n\nCoding language forms the backbone of our digital world. A myriad of devices functions through code - the websites we browse, the mobile applications we use, the wearable tech we sport, everything is a product of coding.\n\nHence, a mistake in the coding process could result in dire consequences – from compromising users’ sensitive data to causing complete systems breakdown. There have been many instances where faulty coding has led to significant losses. The 2015 Starbucks incident is a striking example where a bug in the system led to customers being overcharged. On a more threatening scale, a security vulnerability could expose millions of users' data to malicious hackers.\n\nA key point here is not just errors but the deliberate misuse of coding skills. Codes can be manipulated to create malicious software and viruses that have the potential to harm individuals and organisations greatly. Cybersecurity breaches are increasingly becoming more insidious and complex under the hands of skilled programmers.\n\nIt’s vital that coding is undertaken responsibly. Best practices should always be observed, including testing and checking the code rigorously before launch, patching and updating it regularly. Programmers should be ethical about the kind of programs they write, ensuring they don’t create software that infringes on privacy or poses unnecessary risks.\n\nProgrammers also have a responsibility to continue learning and improving their skills to ensure they remain up-to-date with advancements in technology and the latest safety protocols. \n\nThe tech industry needs to address these issues and provide better training to ensure safer coding practices. Programming should be taught alongside lessons in ethics and responsibility, ensuring future coders understand the potential harm negligent or malicious coding can cause.\n\nIn short, those who code hold a high level of power in this digital age. But, with this power, they must also recognize and take seriously the responsibility they have. Careful and ethical coding is not just recommended in today's world; it is a requirement.",
    "The Football Association (FA) has decided not to penalise Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho following investigations on his comments after the Red Devil’s victory against Newcastle United in October.\n\nIt had initially been reported that Mourinho used offensive language as he walked off the pitch following the dramatic 3-2 win, but the FA has found him not guilty following a review of the evidence and an appeal.\n\nThe fare at Old Trafford seemed to be taking a turn for the worst when Newcastle took a two point lead, but a thrilling last 20 minutes saw the home side clinch victory from the jaws of defeat. Mourinho was visibly emotional on the pitch at full time, and reports surfaced that his comments, made in Portuguese, had included offensive language.\n\nAn independent regulatory commission was set up to review Mourinho's comments. An FA statement said: \"A charge against Jose Mourinho for allegedly using language which was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper has been found not proven following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today.\n\n\"It related to an incident following the Manchester United versus Newcastle United game on 6 October 2018. Written reasons for the decision of the Independent Regulatory Commission will be published in due course. This decision is subject to appeal.\"\n\nJosé Mário dos Santos Mourinho Félix, known as José Mourinho, is a revered figure in European football, having won 25 major honours, making him one of the most successful managers of all time.\n\nThe decision of the FA will thus come as condolence to a Manchester United side that has been under substantial pressure this season both on and off the field. Mourinho has repeatedly come under scrutiny for his conduct, and this judgment should help steady the ship at United's helm.\n\nDorothy Dawkins, a lifelong Manchester United fan, stated, \"We're glad the FA have seen sense, it's time to let Jose do his job without any distractions.\"\n\nThis ruling indicates that the much-criticized Portuguese manager can now focus on his team's performances without any looming sentence from the FA hanging over his head.",

The Russian tennis star was ousted in the first round by an unseeded player, marking a disappointing start to his campaign in the Middle East.\n\nSafin, who was once considered one of the most formidable players on the circuit, has been struggling to regain his form after a series of injuries and inconsistent performances. His loss in Dubai is a stark reminder of the challenges he faces in his quest to return to the top of the game.\n\nThe two-time Grand Slam winner was visibly frustrated throughout the match, struggling to find his rhythm against his lower-ranked opponent. Despite showing flashes of his former brilliance, Safin was unable to maintain his momentum, eventually succumbing to a straight-sets defeat.\n\nThe shock loss is a significant blow to Safin's confidence, who had hoped to use the Dubai Championships as a springboard to kickstart his season. Instead, the Russian will have to go back to the drawing board, reassess his game plan and work on his fitness to ensure he is ready for the upcoming tournaments.\n\nSafin's early exit from the tournament is also a disappointment for the event organisers, who had hoped that the former world number one's participation would draw in large crowds.

    "Argentina has successfully closed a deal to swap $102.6bn in debt, a move that is aimed at averting a damaging default and bringing the South American nation one step closer to economic stability. \n\nThe Argentine government announced the deal on Monday, labeling it a significant moment in the country's efforts to tackle the long-standing issue of hit-or-miss payments on its external debt. Following months of negotiations with private creditors, the government confirmed that it had crossed the 90% acceptance mark needed to move forward with the swap deal.\n\nThe renegotiation of debt has been a cornerstone of President Alberto Fernández’s economic strategy since taking office in December. Seeking to avoid a ninth sovereign debt default, the administration had proposed an ambitious restructuring plan that invited bondholders to exchange their current holdings for new bonds that would pay less and mature later.\n\n\"This pact confirms the support and trust of our foreign investors and the international community,\" said Martin Guzman, Argentina's Economy Minister. \"It lifts a huge burden from our shoulders and charts a clear path towards economic recovery.\"\n\nArgentina's debt saga began in 2001 when it defaulted on nearly $100 billion, leading to years of legal battles with holdout creditors. Since then, the South American nation has been characterized by its precarious economy, underscored by rampant inflation, a fall in the currency, and dwindling foreign reserves.\n\nThe agreement is seen as remarkable in economic circles given that it was reached amid the global shock caused by the pandemic. Dire predictions of a prolonged debt standoff, which many expected would lead to a hard default and deepen the country's economic pain, have been avoided. \n\nInternational Monetary Fund's Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, applauded the agreement, stating that it will provide Argentina with substantial debt relief. “This is a very, very significant step forward,” Georgieva said. “Not just for Argentina but also contributing positively to the stability of the international financial system.”\n\nDespite this positive development, Argentina still faces daunting economic challenges on the horizon. The administration will now begin talks to renegotiate about $44 billion it borrowed from the International Monetary Fund in 2018, the largest loan package in the IMF's history.\n\nThis recent milestone marks a decisive resurrection for Argentina and sends out a strong signal to foreign investors that the country is willing to take serious steps to manage their financial situation. But the road to economic recovery remains long and steep, particularly under the shadow of the Coronavirus pandemic. The government will need to build upon this success with consistent fiscal policies that foster growth and investor confidence.",
    "Germany's unemployment rate has hit a new record low, according to the latest figures from the Federal Employment Agency. The jobless rate has now fallen to 4.9% in a trend that reflects positively on the strength of Europe's biggest economy.\n\nAnalysts had previously predicted this figure, but the milestone endorses Germany's economic stability amid global economic uncertainties, demonstrating potential resilience in the face of international headwinds.\n\nApproximately 2.23 million people were unemployed in Germany last month, the lowest figure recorded since reunification in 1990. This figure is 185,000 fewer than the same period last year and corresponds to a decline of more than 8%.\n\nThe report also highlighted an increase in job vacancies, with around 798,000 open positions reported in April, approximately 6,000 more than during the previous month and 32,000 more than the same period the previous year.\n\n\"The German labour market continues to develop robustly,\" said Detlef Scheele, the head of the Federal Employment Agency. \"Despite a moderate economic development, demand for labour continues to be very high.\"\n\nEconomists assert that Germany´s robust labour market, backed by strong domestic demand, could provide a buffer against potential negative external impacts. These impacts include potential trade uncertainties from Brexit and global trade disputes, as well as slower global economic growth.\n\nAlthough the economy contracted in the third quarter of 2019 and narrowly avoided a recession by posting zero growth in the fourth, Germany’s labour market remained resilient. The strong labour market, record-high employment and rising wages are fuelling a domestically-driven growth upswing, making private consumption an important growth driver.\n\nHowever, despite such a robust labour market, many businesses in the country have reported facing a shortage of skilled workers. The Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry warned last year that the lack of skilled workers could become an increasing problem for Europe's largest economy and could potentially limit its future growth.\n\nIn a tight labour market, economists usually expect wages to rise, fuelling inflation and eventually prompting the European Central Bank (ECB) to hike interest rates. However, wage growth has remained relatively subdued in Germany, keeping inflation in check and allowing the ECB to maintain loose monetary policy.",

    "Former England Under-21 boss Stuart Pearce has expressed strong interest in succeeding Kevin Keegan as the permanent manager of Newcastle United. Keegan stepped down from the coveted position earlier this month due to disagreements with the club's hierarchy over player signings. Pearce, who guided the England Under-21 team to the final of the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, said he is ready for a new challenge in his career.\n\nPearce spent two years as manager of Manchester City before being sacked in 2007. Since then, he has gained significant experience working with young players as the head coach of England Under-21s. During that time, he successfully led the team to the Under-21 European Championships final in 2009 and semi-finals in 2007.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Pearce said, \"I've always maintained that my future lies in club management and the vacancy at Newcastle United represents a fantastic opportunity. It's a club with great tradition, passionate fans and a talented squad of players.\"\n\nHe expressed his admiration for Keegan, saying, \"Kevin did an incredible job whilst in charge of Newcastle, however the game moves on and now the focus is to build on his legacy.\" \n\nReacting to the news, former Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer said, \"Stuart is a determined, ambitious coach with a strong mentality. I believe he could be the right leader for Newcastle at this critical time.\"\n\nPearce's interest in the role comes as Newcastle United has already began the search for a new manager, a process they admit might not be swift. Names such as former Lyon boss Bruno Genesio and ex-Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger have also been mooted as potential candidates for the role.\n\nNewcastle United are currently 14th in the Premier League, having won only one of their first four games of the season. Pearce, if appointed, would be tasked with improving the team's performances and hauling them up the table.\n\nEarlier this year, Pearce expressed his desire to go back into full-time management after enjoying his time in coaching duties with the England national team.\n\nNo official comment from Newcastle United regarding Pearce's statement has been made public yet.",

    "The Conservative Party has sharply criticised the government's shifting stance on crimes committed by burglars, in a move that deepens the ongoing disagreement over national crime policy. They say that the ruling party’s changing policy is full of ‘U-turns’ that may potentially confuse law enforcement agents and the public, painfully affecting the fight against burglary.\n\nPreviously, the government's punitive approach towards burglars suggested a more stringent law enforcement policy. However, recent changes seem to indicate a more lenient approach, as the Tories claim, leading to a series of 'U-turns' that they argue could undermine law enforcement and public faith in the country’s criminal justice system.\n\nTory party crime spokesperson George Armstrong said, “This series of policy changes have created an atmosphere of confusion within the police force and amongst the general public. It’s essential that we have clear and consistent policy particularly when it comes to crime.”\n\nArmstrong further indicated that due to this policy inconsistency, penalties for burglary have become largely unpredictable. \"Public trust in the administration of justice is taking serious hits,\" he added.\n\nWhile the government has claimed their changing approach stems from a desire to assess each burglary on a case-by-case basis, the opposition believes a more harsh and uniform policy is necessary to deter potential criminals.\n\nHome Secretary Sarah Evans responded to these criticisms by noting that laws and policies aimed at combating burglary should be flexible and adaptable. “It is not a series of ‘U-turns’, but rather a series of adaptations to the evolving landscape of crime in the country,\" Evans stated. \"We are committed to facilitating a criminal justice system that adjusts its approach based on the nature of the crime and the circumstances surrounding it.”\n\nWhile there is truth to both arguments, it is clear that the debate around the government's approach to burglars reveals a much deeper struggle to find the balance between maintaining a stern face to deter potential criminals, and being adaptable to protect the rights of individuals.\n\nWhether a strict uniform policy or a more flexible one will prove more successful in reducing burglaries is something only time will tell. However, this issue undoubtedly amplifies the need for an ongoing conversation about the best ways to enforce crime policies that strike a balance between justice, reform, and enforcement.\n",

His tactical kicking kept the Scots on the back foot, while his distribution was instrumental in setting up several of Ireland's tries.\n\nScotland, on the other hand, struggled to find their rhythm.

    "An investigation has been launched into a controversial comment made by a member of parliament in Kenya, who was accused of making a Nazi salute during a heated debate in the country's legislative assembly.\n\nThe incident occurred on Tuesday, when MP Moses Kuria stood up to speak during a debate on a proposed constitutional amendment. Footage shows him extending his arm and making a gesture that resembles the Nazi salute, sparking outrage among fellow lawmakers and on social media.\n\nKuria, who represents the Gatundu South constituency, has since denied any intentional wrongdoing, saying that he was simply trying to make a point and did not mean to offend anyone. However, many have called for his resignation, including members of the Jewish community in Kenya, who say they are deeply hurt by the gesture.\n\n\"This is not just an insult to the Jewish community, but to all people who value human rights and dignity,\" said Rabbi Sholom Ber Shapiro, leader of the Nairobi Synagogue. \"We demand that Mr. Kuria apologize unreservedly and take responsibility for his actions.\"\n\nThe speaker of the National Assembly, Justin Muturi, has also condemned the gesture, calling it \"unacceptable behavior\" and promising to take appropriate action. The matter has been referred to the parliamentary committee on privileges and immunities, which will investigate the incident and determine whether Kuria violated any rules or codes of conduct.\n\nThe incident has reignited concerns about hate speech and discrimination in Kenya, where there have been several high-profile incidents in recent years involving politicians and other public figures making inflammatory remarks against minority groups.\n\n\"Hate speech and discrimination have no place in our society, and we must take a strong stand against them,\" said Kenya's Attorney General, Paul Kihara. \"We urge all leaders to be mindful of their words and actions, and to respect the diversity of our nation.\"\n\nAs the investigation continues, many are calling for greater awareness and education around issues of tolerance and inclusivity, as well as stricter",
    "British politician Alastair Campbell has dismissed the ongoing controversy surrounding his use of personal email accounts for government business as a \"silly fuss.\"\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Mr. Campbell, who served as director of communications and strategy under Prime Minister Tony Blair, said that he had done nothing wrong and that the criticism aimed at him was unfounded.\n\n\"I simply don't understand what all the fuss is about,\" Mr. Campbell said. \"I used my personal email account for convenience sake, just like many other people in government do. It's not a big deal.\"\n\nMr. Campbell's comments come after it emerged that he had used a private email address to send sensitive government documents to colleagues and advisors, including Mr. Blair. Critics have accused him of breaching security protocols and skirting transparency laws by using a non-governmental email account for official business.\n\nBut Mr. Campbell pushed back against those claims, saying that he had followed proper procedures and cleared his actions with government officials before sending any emails. He also pointed out that many other government officials, including the prime minister himself, had also used personal email accounts for work purposes without incident.\n\nWhile acknowledging that there may be legitimate concerns about data protection and security, Mr. Campbell insisted that these issues were being blown out of proportion in his case.\n\nHowever, opposition politicians and transparency advocates remain skeptical. They argue that the use of personal email accounts for government business creates a risk of important information falling into the wrong hands or being deleted or altered, and undermines efforts to promote openness and accountability in government.\n\nThe controversy over Mr. Campbell's email habits comes amid wider concerns about government secrecy and the handling of sensitive information. The issue is likely to continue to generate debate as the UK continues to grapple with questions around data privacy and public transparency.",

    "Plans to create a \"super union\" by merging some of the UK's largest trade unions have been touted as a way to increase the collective bargaining power of workers and boost their influence in the face of a changing jobs market and declining unionization rates.\n\nThe proposal, which has been floated by several senior union leaders, would involve the merger of some of the UK's biggest unions, including Unite, Unison, and the GMB. The new entity would have a combined membership of millions of workers, making it one of the largest and most powerful unions in the country.\n\nSupporters of the plan argue that a larger, more unified union would be better equipped to negotiate with employers and government on issues such as pay, working conditions, and job security. They also point out that a super union would have the resources and capacity to organize campaigns and strikes on a larger scale, potentially leading to more effective industrial action.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced. Some union leaders and experts have expressed concerns that a super union could become too unwieldy and bureaucratic, making it difficult for members to have a say in decision-making and for the union to respond quickly to changing circumstances. There are also fears that a merger could lead to a loss of identity and autonomy for the individual unions involved.\n\nThe idea of a super union has been discussed for several years, but it has gained renewed attention in recent months as unions look for ways to react to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of the gig economy. The pandemic has exposed weaknesses in the traditional union model, with many workers in insecure or freelance employment struggling to access union representation and support.\n\nThe gig economy, which has grown significantly in recent years, has also posed challenges for unions, with many workers in this sector operating outside of traditional employment arrangements and therefore outside of the traditional union framework. A super union could potentially help to address these challenges by providing a more flexible and adaptable structure for representing workers in a changing job market.\n\nThe proposal is not without precedent. In recent years, several unions have merged",

However, users will need to have a valid internet connection in order to use the service. The company plans to generate revenue through advertising and sponsored content, rather than through subscription fees or per-minute charges.\n\nHotspot Calling is currently available in a number of locations, including coffee shops, airports, and public parks. The company plans to expand its service to additional locations in the coming months, with the goal of creating a network of hotspots that can be used for free internet calls.\n\nThe launch of Hotspot Calling has been met with excitement from users, who see it as a convenient and cost-effective way to stay in touch with friends and family. \"I'm always on the go, and this service is a game-changer for me,\" said one user. \"I can now make calls from anywhere, without having to worry about racking up a huge phone bill.\"\n\nThe service has also been praised for its potential to bridge the digital divide, by providing a free communication option for those who may not have",
    "Ireland's stock market has reached an all-time high, with investors buoyed by the country's strong economic growth and positive corporate earnings.\n\nThe ISEQ index, which tracks the performance of Irish shares, closed at 7,162.84 points on Tuesday, surpassing its previous record set in April 2007. The benchmark has risen more than 15% this year, outperforming many other European indexes.\n\nThe rally was led by financials, with Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks gaining 3.9% and 2.7%, respectively. Other notable gainers included building materials company CRH, which rose 2.3%, and Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, which climbed 1.7%.\n\nThe market's impressive performance is largely attributed to Ireland's robust economy, which grew at a rate of 8.2% in the first quarter, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in the EU. Investor confidence has also been boosted by the country's improving fiscal health, with the government recently announcing plans to reduce its budget deficit below 3% of GDP next year.\n\n\"Ireland's economy is firing on all cylinders,\" said David Owen, chief European economist at Jefferies International. \"Strong exports, rising consumer spending, and a recovering housing market are all contributing to the country's impressive growth story.\"\n\nDespite concerns over global trade tensions and Brexit uncertainty, analysts remain optimistic about the future prospects for Irish equities. \"We see further upside potential for the ISEQ, given the country's solid fundamentals and attractive valuations compared to other developed markets,\" said Alan McQuaid, head of research at Merrion Capital.\n\nHowever, some experts caution that the market may be due for a correction after such a strong run. \"While we remain positive on the overall outlook for Irish equities, we would advise investors to exercise some caution at these levels,\" warned D",
    "The UK's Visa and Immigration department has been making decisions on visa applications at an unprecedented rate, with officials revealing that they are currently approving or rejecting an application every 11 minutes.\n\nAccording to figures released by the Home Office, the department received over 300,000 visa applications in the first quarter of this year alone, representing a significant increase from previous years. Despite the surge in demand, the department claims to have processed more than 90% of these applications within its standard service standards, which aim to have decisions made within three weeks for most cases.\n\nThe startling figure comes as the UK government continues its efforts to streamline the visa process, with a focus on attracting businesses and tourists to Britain while maintaining security and control over borders. Efficiency measures put in place recently include improved technology and staff training, designed to minimize processing time and reduce the backlog of cases needing manual review.\n\nCritics fear that accelerated processing times could compromise the accuracy of assessments and see deserving applicants unfairly rejected. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper responded to the announcement saying,\" While efficient processing is important there must always be thorough scrutiny and effective checks to prevent immigration abuse.\"\n\nIn contrast, some experts contend that speedy turnarounds will benefit Britain economically, pointing out that delays can deter potential investors and visitors. CEO of London First, Jasmine Whitbread comments, “With high-growth markets like China and India increasing their share of global travel, it’s crucial our visa system keeps up, while also ensuring security.”  For applicants whose lives depend on swift determinations, a faster visa process would indeed provide relief. Investment banker Abdi Shire thought his future was secured when offered a position with a major financial institution in the City only to wait several months for clearance to take up the role. He observes ruefully, “It meant I had to spend Christmas without my family because I couldn’t risk leaving the country once the application was underway”.\n\nWhile there may be disagreement over",
    "The latest jobs report from the United States has revealed that employment growth remains sluggish, with fewer jobs added to the economy than expected. According to figures released by the Labor Department, the US economy added just 134,000 jobs in September, falling short of economists' predictions of around 185,000 new positions.\n\nThis disappointing figure comes as a surprise, given the recent trend of strong job gains in the US. Over the past year, the economy has been adding an average of 207,000 jobs per month, and many experts had predicted that this upward trajectory would continue. However, the September numbers suggest that the labor market may be cooling off slightly.\n\nDespite the slower-than-expected jobs growth, the unemployment rate did tick down to 3.6%, its lowest level since December 2000. This is likely due to a decrease in the number of people actively looking for work, rather than a significant increase in employment opportunities.\n\nThe industries that saw the most notable job gains in September were healthcare and education services, which added 44,000 and 39,000 jobs respectively. Professional and business services also saw modest growth, with 35,000 new positions. On the other hand, manufacturing and construction both experienced declines, losing 16,000 and 17,000 jobs respectively.\n\nWhile the overall jobs growth number was lower than anticipated, it's important to note that the labor market is still showing signs of strength. Wages continued their upward trend, with hourly earnings increasing by 0.6% over the past month and 3.1% over the past year. Additionally, the number of workers who are voluntarily quitting their jobs – often seen as a sign of confidence in the job market – remained high at 3.7 million.\n\nHowever, some analysts are expressing concerns about the long-term health of the labor market. With the global economy facing headwinds such as trade tensions and economic uncertainty, there are fears that the US could be heading towards a",
    "Parmalat, the Italian dairy company that filed for bankruptcy in 2003, has launched legal action against 45 banks, accusing them of contributing to its financial downfall.\n\nThe company, which was once one of Italy's largest food groups, collapsed in 2003 with debts of around €14 billion. It has now filed a lawsuit against a number of domestic and international banks, including several major institutions such as Deutsche Bank, UBS, and Credit Suisse.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the banks engaged in fraudulent behavior by selling Parmalat fake or non-existent financial instruments. The company alleges that it was convinced to invest in these products, which were often described as high-risk but high-yielding, in order to boost its financial performance. However, many of these instruments later turned out to be worthless or did not exist at all, leaving Parmalat facing huge losses.\n\nThe lawsuit also claims that some of the banks knew about the questionable nature of these transactions but failed to inform Parmalat. Instead, they are accused of actively misrepresenting the risks involved in order to persuade the company to invest further.\n\nParmalat is seeking damages totaling €800 million from the banks, which it believes would have been avoided if the banks had acted honestly and transparently. The company argues that the banks' actions caused significant harm to its business operations and reputation, ultimately leading to its collapse.\n\nThis latest development comes after years of legal proceedings involving Parmalat, including a lengthy investigation into the company's accounting practices and numerous criminal trials. Several former executives have already been convicted of fraud and other offenses related to their role in the scandal.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, some of the named banks have denied any wrongdoing and expressed confidence that they will be vindicated in court. Others have yet to comment publicly on the matter.\n\nDespite emerging from bankruptcy protection in 2007, Parmalat still faces significant challenges. The company recently reported a",
    "A investigation into allegations of doping by high-profile athlete Marion Jones has begun, the BBC has learned.\n\nJones, a former world champion sprinter and Olympic gold medallist, has been accused of using performance-enhancing drugs during her career. The allegations were first made in a newspaper report last week, and have since been the subject of intense speculation and debate in the athletics community.\n\nThe investigation, which is being led by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), will focus on evidence collected from Jones's blood samples, which were taken during her competitions over the past few years.\n\nAccording to sources close to the investigation, the samples have shown \"abnormalities\" that are consistent with the use of performance-enhancing drugs. However, it is important to note that the results are not yet conclusive, and Jones has strenuously denied any wrongdoing.\n\nJones's coach, Trevor Graham, has also been implicated in the scandal, with reports suggesting that he may have provided his athlete with performance-enhancing drugs. Graham has denied the allegations, but has been suspended by the US athletics federation pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nThe investigation is expected to be completed within the next few weeks, and if the allegations against Jones are proven, she could face severe penalties, including a lifetime ban from the sport.\n\nThe news has sent shockwaves through the athletics world, with many of Jones's fellow athletes expressing their disappointment and disbelief at the allegations. \"I can't believe this is happening,\" said one top athlete, who wished to remain anonymous. \"Marion has always been a role model for me, and I can't understand how she could do this.\"\n\nThe scandal has also raised questions about the prevalence of doping in athletics, and the effectiveness of the sport's anti-doping measures. \"This is a wake-up call for the athletics community,\" said a spokesperson for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). \"We need to ensure that our testing procedures are robust and effective",

    "Dublin, Ireland - In a surprise move, the hi-tech labs in Dublin have announced that they will be shutting down operations. The labs, which were established in 2015, were meant to be a hub for innovation and technological advancement in the city.\n\nThe decision to shut down the labs was made by the management team, citing financial difficulties and a shift in the company's strategic direction. The closure will result in the loss of 120 jobs, primarily in the fields of software development, data analysis, and research.\n\nThe news has come as a shock to employees, many of whom have spent years working at the labs. \"I'm devastated,\" said one employee, who wishes to remain anonymous. \"I've put my heart and soul into this job, and now it's all being taken away. It's a huge blow to the team and to the tech community in Dublin.\"\n\nThe closure of the labs will also have a significant impact on the local tech industry. The labs have been a key player in the city's tech scene, collaborating with startups, universities, and other organizations to drive innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\n\"This is a big loss for Dublin's tech community,\" said John O'Connor, founder of a local startup. \"The labs have been a valuable resource for us, providing access to cutting-edge technology and expertise. Their closure will leave a big gap in the ecosystem.\"\n\nThe management team has promised to support employees through the transition, providing severance packages and assistance in finding new jobs. However, the news has sparked concerns about the future of the tech industry in Dublin.\n\n\"This closure is a reminder that the tech industry is constantly evolving, and companies must adapt to stay competitive,\" said industry expert, David McNamara. \"But it's also a reminder of the importance of investing in homegrown talent and supporting the local tech community.

    "In a move that could shake up the banking industry in Nigeria, two of the country's largest banks, First Bank and UBA, have announced plans to merge. The proposed merger, which is still subject to regulatory approval, would create a new entity with assets totaling over $1.5 billion.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the banks, the merger is aimed at creating a stronger and more competitive player in the market, with the ability to offer a wider range of services and products to customers. The combined entity would have a large network of branches and ATMs across Nigeria, as well as a strong presence in West Africa.\n\nThe merger is seen as a response to the increasing competition in the Nigerian banking sector, which has seen the entry of new players in recent years. The combination of First Bank and UBA would create a bank with the scale and resources to compete more effectively with these new entrants, and to offer customers a wider range of services and products.\n\nFirst Bank, which is owned by the Nigerian government, has been looking to expand its operations and increase its market share. UBA, on the other hand, has been seeking to strengthen its position in the Nigerian market, where it has a significant presence.\n\nThe proposed merger is expected to be completed by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval. The new entity would be listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange and would be governed by a board of directors made up of representatives from both banks.\n\nThe merger is expected to have a positive impact on the Nigerian economy, creating jobs and stimulating economic growth. It would also provide customers with access to a wider range of financial services, including loans, savings, and investment products.\n\nHowever, the merger could also lead to job losses, as the combined entity may look to streamline its operations and eliminate redundant positions. The banks have not yet disclosed the number of jobs that may be affected.\n\nThe merger is the latest in a series of consolidations in the Nigerian banking sector, which has seen several small and medium-sized banks merge or collapse in recent years. The sector has also faced challenges such as",
    "A senior police officer has publicly supported a controversial proposal to allow people to drink alcohol in public spaces, sparking debate and discussion across the country.\n\nChief Constable John Smith, head of the Metropolitan Police Service, argued that the current laws prohibiting the consumption of alcohol in public places are outdated and unnecessary. He believes that allowing people to drink responsibly in parks, streets, and other public areas would help to reduce crime and improve community relations.\n\n\"The current system is not working,\" Chief Constable Smith said in an interview with the BBC. \"We have seen a rise in street drinking and associated anti-social behavior, despite the fact that it's illegal. It's time for us to rethink our approach and find ways to enable responsible drinking in public.\"\n\nUnder the proposed plan, local authorities would be given the power to designate specific areas where alcohol could be consumed, subject to certain restrictions. For example, drinking might be allowed in designated park areas during specified hours, or on pavements outside licensed premises.\n\nSupporters of the proposal argue that it would help to reduce the number of rowdy gatherings in residential areas, as well as the amount of litter and noise associated with street drinking. They also point out that many cities around the world allow drinking in public spaces without any significant issues.\n\nHowever, critics of the plan have expressed concerns about the potential impact on public health and safety. They argue that making it easier to drink in public could lead to increased levels of alcoholism and related problems, such as violence and disorder.\n\nThe proposal has sparked a heated debate, with some accusing Chief Constable Smith of being too soft on crime and others praising him for taking a progressive stance. The issue is likely to be a topic of discussion in the coming weeks and months, as policymakers consider whether to implement the changes.",
    "In a surprising move, Microsoft has announced that it is offering a special deal for users who have been using pirated copies of its popular operating system, Windows XP. The company has launched an amnesty program whereby those who have been using illegally obtained versions of Windows XP can swap their software for legitimate, fully licensed copies at a significantly discounted price.\n\nAccording to Microsoft representatives, this offer is part of the company's ongoing efforts to combat software piracy and encourage customers to use genuine software. By providing an affordable way for users to transition to legal software, Microsoft hopes to reduce the number of pirated copies in circulation and protect consumers from potential security risks associated with illegal software.\n\n\"We understand that many people may have unknowingly purchased pirated software or downloaded it without realizing the risks,\" said a Microsoft spokesperson. \"This offer provides them with a chance to upgrade to genuine Windows XP at a lower cost than buying a new copy outright.\"\n\nThe swap offer is currently available in select countries, including China, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. To take advantage of the deal, users must bring their pirated Windows XP CDs or installation media to authorized Microsoft retailers or distributors and purchase a qualifying edition of Windows XP during the promotion period. Participants will receive a significant discount off the normal retail price of Windows XP Home Edition or Professional Edition.\n\nMicrosoft emphasizes that only genuine, non-pirated copies of Windows XP are eligible for this offer. Those who have already purchased legitimate copies of the operating system are not eligible for the trade-in program. Additionally, counterfeit or tampered software cannot be exchanged under this promotion.\n\nSoftware piracy remains a major problem worldwide, with studies suggesting that nearly one in every three software programs installed globally last year was pirated. This phenomenon results in substantial financial losses for software developers and poses threats to computer security and stability. Through initiatives like the swap offer, Microsoft seeks to educate users about the benefits of utilising legitimate software while protecting its intellectual property rights.\n\nThe limited time offer is scheduled to end in six",

But this year, there's a twist - instead of the usual suspects like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Miracle on 34th Street\", a newcomer has taken the top spot: \"The Focker's Family Christmas\".\n\nThe film, which follows the misadventures of a dysfunctional family as they navigate the ups and downs of the holiday season, has captured the hearts of audiences around the world. Its success can be attributed to its relatable characters, hilarious dialogue, and heartwarming message about the importance of family and forgiveness.\n\nStarring an all-star cast including Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, and Dustin Hoffman, \"The Focker's Family Christmas\" has been praised for its witty humor and poignant moments. The film's writer and director, Jay Roach, said in a statement that he was thrilled by the response to the film. \"I knew we had something special on our hands when we were making it, but I never expected it to resonate with audiences like this,\" he said.\n\nThe film's success has also sparked a renewed interest in the genre of festive comedies. Other movies like \"Elf\" and \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\" have seen a surge in popularity, with many fans taking to social media to share their favorite quotes and scenes from the films.\n\nBut \"The Focker's Family Christmas\" isn't just entertainment - it's also providing a boost to the economy. The film's success has led to increased sales of holiday-themed merchandise, such as ornaments, sweaters, and gift wrap.

    "California has taken a major step in protecting its citizens' online privacy by imposing fines on companies that install spyware on their devices without consent.\n\nUnder a new law signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, any company found to have installed spyware or other forms of malicious software on a person's device without their knowledge and consent could face fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The law applies to any company that collects personal information from California residents, regardless of where the company is based.\n\nThe move comes as concerns about online privacy continue to grow, with many people feeling that their personal data is being exploited by tech companies without their knowledge or control. Spyware, which can be used to track browsing history, monitor keystrokes, and even activate cameras and microphones remotely, is seen as a particularly invasive form of digital surveillance.\n\n\"Californians have a right to privacy, and we must do everything in our power to protect them from those who seek to profit off their personal information,\" said Governor Newsom in a statement. \"This bill sends a clear message to companies that they must respect consumers' privacy or face serious consequences.\"\n\nThe new law gives the state's Attorney General's office the authority to investigate and prosecute cases of unauthorized spyware installation. It also allows individuals to sue companies directly if they believe their privacy has been violated.\n\nTech industry groups have expressed concern that the law could create confusion for businesses and stifle innovation, but consumer advocates say it is a necessary measure to protect people's privacy in the digital age.\n\n\"Spyware is a dangerous threat to our online security and privacy, and this law will help ensure that companies are held accountable for their actions,\" said Sarah Smith, a policy analyst at the Consumer Federation of America. \"We applaud California for taking a leadership role in protecting consumers' rights.\"\n\nThe law takes effect on January 1st, 2023, giving companies time to adjust their practices and ensure they obtain proper consent before installing any software on",
    "The trial of former baseball player Roger Maris's home run record holder, Barry Bonds, has been scheduled to begin on March 2nd, 2009. Bonds is accused of lying under oath about his use of performance-enhancing drugs during a 2003 grand jury testimony.\n\nBonds, who played for the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics during his career, faces four counts of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice. Prosecutors allege that he lied when he denied using steroids and human growth hormone, as well as when he denied receiving injections from his personal trainer, Greg Anderson.\n\nAnderson, who was indicted along with Bonds, will also stand trial on March 2nd. He faces charges of conspiracy to distribute steroids and money laundering.\n\nThe investigation into Bonds began in 2003, after allegations surfaced that he had used performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career. In 2007, a federal grand jury indicted him on the five counts that he will face at trial.\n\nBonds' legal team has argued that the government's case against him is based on flawed evidence and that prosecutors have engaged in selective prosecution. They have also claimed that the statute of limitations for the charges has expired.\n\nHowever, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston rejected those arguments last month, clearing the way for the trial to proceed. She ruled that the government had presented sufficient evidence to support the charges and that the statute of limitations had not expired.\n\nThe trial is expected to last several weeks and could potentially feature testimony from a number of high-profile witnesses, including former major league players and executives. If convicted, Bonds could face up to 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine for each count of perjury, as well as an additional five years and a $250,000 fine for the obstruction of justice charge.",
    "According to a recent report, the number of personal computers (PCs) in use worldwide is expected to double by 2010. The study, conducted by market research firm Gartner, predicts that the global PC installed base will reach 1.7 billion units by the end of 2010, up from 845 million in 2006.\n\nThe rapid growth in PC ownership is being driven by several factors, including falling prices, improved technology, and increased demand for digital media. The report suggests that the trend towards mobile computing, such as laptops and mini-notebooks, is also contributing to the increase in PC adoption.\n\nGeographically, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the main driver of growth, with PC penetration rates projected to exceed 30% by 2010. In contrast, mature markets such as North America and Western Europe are expected to experience slower growth, as PC ownership is already relatively high in these regions.\n\nThe report also highlights the increasing importance of emerging markets, particularly India and China, which are expected to become major players in the global PC market. By 2010, it is predicted that these two countries alone will account for over 20% of the total global PC installed base.\n\nDespite the overall positive outlook, there are concerns about the environmental impact of the growing number of PCs. Critics argue that the production and disposal of computers contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and electronic waste. However, some manufacturers have begun to address these issues by introducing energy-efficient models and recycling programs.\n\nIn conclusion, the forecast doubling of PC ownership by 2010 represents a significant milestone in the history of computing. As more people around the world gain access to personal computers, it is likely to have far-reaching implications for communication, education, and commerce.",

We will continue to work hard to ensure that we can overcome any obstacles and maintain our position as one of the world's leading economies.\"\n\nMr. Brown's comments come amidst growing worries about the impact of global economic trends on the UK. Some experts have warned that the country could be heading for a period of slow growth or even recession, due to factors such as the downturn in the housing market and rising oil prices.\n\nHowever, the Chancellor rejected these gloomy predictions, pointing out that the UK had experienced steady growth over the past decade and had weathered previous economic storms successfully. He also highlighted recent data showing that consumer spending and business investment remained robust.\n\nDespite his optimism, Mr. Brown did acknowledge that there were areas where action needed to be taken to support the economy. He pledged to continue working with international partners to address issues such as climate change and trade imbalances, which could have an impact on future economic growth.\n\nOpposition politicians and some analysts have criticized Mr. Brown for being too complacent about the economy's prospects. They argue that he should take more decisive action to address potential risks and vulnerabilities. However, the Chancellor's supporters say that his cautious approach is appropriate given the current uncertainty in global markets.\n\nOverall, Mr. Brown's speech was seen as an attempt to reassure the public and business community that the government is taking a proactive approach to managing the economy. While there may be challenges ahead, he believes that the UK is well-equipped to face them and",

The police were baffled by the lack of motive or evidence, and as the investigation dragged on, the public began to lose hope.\n\nThat was when Holmes, who had been in retirement for several years, was approached by the victim's family to take on the case. Despite his initial reluctance, Holmes was intrigued by the peculiar circumstances and agreed to help.\n\nWorking closely with his trusted sidekick, Dr. John Watson, Holmes began his investigation by interviewing the victim's family and employees. He soon discovered a series of odd inconsistencies in their testimonies, which led him to suspect that the murder was not as straightforward as it seemed.\n\nHolmes' keen observation skills and deductive powers proved to be invaluable as he pieced together the events of the night of the murder. He discovered that the victim had been planning to revealed a major scandal involving several high-profile individuals, which led him to suspect that the murder was a deliberate attempt to silence him.\n\nAs Holmes delved deeper into the case, he encountered numerous red herrings and faced opposition from powerful figures who were desperate to keep the truth hidden. However, he remained undeterred and continued to follow the trail of clues, even when it put his own life in danger.\n\nIn the end, Holmes' perseverance paid off, and he uncovered the shocking truth behind the murder. The killer was revealed to be a seemingly innocent bystander who had been manipulated by a powerful mastermind.\n\nThe case was closed, and justice was served, thanks to the remarkable detective skills of Sherlock Holmes.

    "The Conservative Party has renewed its call for tax cuts to boost economic growth and stimulate business investment in the UK. Speaking at a conference on Monday, senior Tory MPs argued that reducing taxes would help to offset the negative impact of Brexit uncertainty and attract foreign investment.\n\n\"We need to take bold action to get our economy moving,\" said Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid. \"Tax cuts are a key part of our plan to turbocharge businesses and create jobs across the country.\"\n\nThe Tories have been advocating for a series of tax reductions, including cutting corporation tax to 15%, slashing income tax rates, and abolishing the National Insurance Contributions (NICs) threshold. They argue that these measures would put more money in people's pockets, increase consumer spending, and encourage entrepreneurs to start new businesses.\n\nHowever, critics say that such tax cuts would primarily benefit the wealthy and do little to address the root causes of Britain's productivity problem. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell accused the Tories of resorting to \"trickle-down economics\", which he claimed had failed in the past.\n\n\"Their policies will only widen inequality and damage public services,\" McDonnell said. \"We need a proper industrial strategy that invests in infrastructure, skills, and research – not just giveaways to the rich.\"\n\nThe debate over tax cuts comes as the UK struggles to maintain its economic momentum in the face of Brexit uncertainty. GDP growth slowed to 0.3% in the third quarter, down from 0.7% in the previous three months. Business investment has also stalled, with many companies hesitant to commit resources until they know what kind of trade deal the UK will secure with the EU.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Tories remain committed to their tax-cutting agenda. They point to countries like the United States, where President Trump's signature tax reforms have helped fuel economic growth.

These include offering free alcoholic drinks to encourage players to keep gambling, using high-pressure sales tactics to convince people to sign up for loyalty programs, and manipulating game rules to make it harder for players to win.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the UK Gambling Commission, the proposed regulations aim to protect vulnerable individuals from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous operators. \"We want to ensure that all gambling in the UK is fair, transparent, and conducted in a responsible manner,\" they said.\n\nThe move comes after several high-profile cases of problem gamblers who have lost large sums of money at casinos, leading to financial ruin and even suicide. Critics argue that the industry has a responsibility to do more to prevent such tragedies, rather than profiting from them.\n\nCasino operators, however, say that the proposals go too far and could harm their businesses. They claim that many of the practices targeted by the regulations are commonplace and not necessarily harmful. \"These restrictions will only hurt our ability to compete with other forms of entertainment,\" said one industry representative.\n\nBut advocates for gambling reform disagree. According to Dr. Mark Griffiths, a leading expert on gambling addiction, the measures are necessary to address the root causes of problem gambling. \"Research shows that certain design features of slot machines and other games can activate the brain's reward system in ways that lead to addiction,\" he explained. \"By removing these elements, we can help reduce the risk of harm.\"\n\nIf enacted, the UK's ban on casino tricks would follow similar moves in other countries, including Australia and Canada. It remains to be seen how the proposal will fare in Parliament, where",
    "As technology continues to advance and play an increasingly prominent role in our daily lives, the importance of coding has become impossible to ignore. From smartphones to social media, the way we interact with the digital world is shaped by lines of code written by developers across the globe. However, as the influence of coding grows, so too do concerns about its potential impact on society.\n\nRecent years have seen a surge in the number of people learning to code, with many schools and organizations offering courses and resources aimed at teaching young people programming skills. This trend has been hailed as a positive step towards equipping future generations with the tools they need to succeed in a rapidly changing job market.\n\nHowever, some experts are sounding a note of caution. They argue that while coding can be a powerful tool for creativity and innovation, it also carries the risk of perpetuating harmful biases and stereotypes if not used responsibly. For example, algorithms used in criminal justice or financial systems can disproportionately affect certain groups, leading to unfair outcomes and reinforcing existing social inequalities.\n\nMoreover, there is evidence to suggest that the tech industry itself may be contributing to the problem. Research has shown that diverse teams produce better software, yet women and minority groups remain underrepresented in the field. This lack of diversity can lead to a narrow perspective that neglects the needs and experiences of marginalized communities.\n\nTo address these issues, some organizations are taking steps to promote greater inclusivity in coding. Initiatives such as Code2040, which connects high-performing Black and Latino software engineers with career opportunities, are working to increase diversity in the tech industry. Similarly, programs like Girls Who Code offer free coding lessons and mentorship to girls from underserved communities.\n\nBut individual action is also crucial. Developers must be mindful of their own biases and take steps to mitigate them in their work. Techniques such as testing for bias in data sets and actively seeking feedback from diverse sources can help ensure that code is written in a way that benefits everyone.\n\nUltimately, the power of coding lies not just in creating",
    "Swiss tennis star Roger Federer has reportedly been turned down by Roche, the pharmaceutical company, after he approached them with an offer to collaborate on a new project.\n\nAccording to sources close to the situation, Federer, who is widely considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time, had been in talks with Roche about the possibility of working together on a new venture. However, it appears that the negotiations have broken down and Roche has declined Federer's offer.\n\nThe exact details of the proposed collaboration are unclear, but it is thought that Federer was looking to work with Roche on a project related to his foundation, which focuses on improving children's education and access to sports opportunities.\n\nFederer, who has won 20 Grand Slam titles and has been ranked as the world number one for a record 310 weeks, is known for his philanthropic efforts and has worked with a number of charitable organizations throughout his career.\n\nA spokesperson for Roche said in a statement: \"We appreciate Roger Federer's interest in collaborating with us, but we have decided not to move forward with this opportunity at this time.\"\n\nFederer's representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThis development comes as a surprise to many, given Federer's high profile and reputation as a global sporting icon.

    "A new technology utilizing lasers is being implemented to connect devices in areas with poor or non-existent internet connectivity, bridging the gap for those previously disconnected from the digital world.\n\nIn remote regions where traditional networking infrastructure is unavailable or unreliable, laser-based connections are providing a reliable and efficient means of communication. By harnessing the power of light, these systems use lasers to transmit data through free space, allowing devices to communicate with one another without the need for physical cables or cellular networks.\n\nThe technology works by using small, low-power lasers to create narrow beams of light that can travel long distances and penetrate through obstacles such as trees or buildings. These beams are then received by photodetectors, which convert the light signals back into electrical signals that can be interpreted by devices.\n\nOne company at the forefront of this technology is LightPointe, whose products have been used to establish high-speed connections between buildings and even mountain tops. Their systems can transmit data at speeds of up to 10 Gbps (gigabits per second), making them ideal for applications such as video streaming, online gaming, and cloud computing.\n\n\"Our technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we connect devices,\" said John Smith, CEO of LightPointe. \"Not only does it provide fast and reliable connectivity, but it also eliminates the need for expensive and time-consuming infrastructure development.\"\n\nAnother benefit of laser-based connections is their security. Unlike radio waves, which can be intercepted or jammed, light signals are difficult to detect and intercept, making them virtually immune to eavesdropping and interference. This makes them particularly useful for sensitive applications such as military communications or financial transactions.\n\nWhile still a relatively new technology, laser-based connections are already being adopted in various parts of the world. In Africa, for example, they are being used to connect communities in rural areas where traditional internet access is limited or non-existent. Similarly, in urban areas, they are being used to create high-speed networks between skyscrapers and other tall structures.\n\nAs the demand for faster",

Bassist Fieldy said that he was heartbroken but understood that sometimes people need to move on to pursue other passions. Drummer Ray Luzier described Munky as a brother and said that his departure would be deeply felt both musically and personally. Guitarist James \"Munky\" Shaffer himself released a brief statement saying that it is time for me to move on and explore new opportunities.\n\nKorn has enjoyed significant success since forming in 1993, releasing hit albums such as Follow The Leader and Issues. They have been known for blending elements of rock, funk, hip-hop and metal. The band has sold more than 40 million records worldwide and bagged itself two Grammy nominations. Though there have been lineup changes through the years, the departure of Munky, who has been with them since their early days, comes as a surprise. He played an important role in shaping the band's distinctive sound that fans love and will be difficult to replace, despite several capable guitarists available who could fill the void.  \n\nFans, too, took to social media expressing the range of emotions - from disbelief to disappointment at the announcement with some wishing him well on this next chapter of his journey while others implored him to return soon or asked if this meant the end of Korn. It remains unclear what Jonathon Davis, Fieldy, and co want to do next but one thing is sure - whatever happens next for either party, there will definitely be a lot of eyes watching.",
    "Athens, Greece - Greek sprinter Katerina Thanou has expressed her desire to return to competitive athletics, eight years after she was banned for doping offenses.\n\nThanou, who won gold in the 100m and 200m at the 2004 Olympics, was suspended from competition for two years after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs following her victories in Athens. She later retired from the sport, but has now revealed that she is eager to make a comeback.\n\n\"I miss the feeling of being on the track, the rush of adrenaline, and the thrill of competition,\" Thanou said in an interview with a local newspaper. \"I know I've made mistakes in the past, but I want to prove to myself and others that I can still perform cleanly.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old has been training privately in recent months, and says she is determined to compete again, despite the challenges she faces. \"It won't be easy, I know that,\" she admitted. \"But I'm willing to put in the hard work and dedication required to get back to where I belong.\"\n\nThanou's ban was controversial at the time, as it came just days before the start of the Olympic Games, and many critics accused her of using performance-enhancing drugs throughout her career. However, Thanou maintains that she only used the drugs once, and that they were prescribed to her by a doctor for medical reasons.\n\nDespite this, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has imposed strict conditions on Thanou's potential return to competition. In addition to undergoing regular drug tests, she must also participate in an education program aimed at promoting anti-doping awareness among athletes.\n\nThanou has accepted these conditions, and insists that she wants to use her experience to help other athletes avoid making the same mistakes she did. \"I want to show young athletes that there are no shortcuts to success, and that you have to work hard and stay clean to achieve your goals,\" she said",
    "Search engines have long been an essential tool for people looking for information online. However, traditional search engines often require users to enter specific keywords or phrases to find what they're looking for. But now, a new generation of search platforms is emerging that aim to make finding information even easier by getting closer to the user's needs and intentions.\n\nOne such platform is Answer Engine, which uses natural language processing (NLP) technology to understand the context behind a user's query and provide more accurate results. Instead of simply matching keywords, Answer Engine can understand complex questions and deliver relevant answers, often without the need for the user to click on any links.\n\nAnother innovative search platform is Snapchat's 'Stories' feature, which allows users to search for content within the app using visual queries. Users can take a photo or video of something they want to learn more about, and then use the app's built-in camera button to search for related content. This hands-free approach to searching has proven popular among younger generations who are used to communicating through images rather than text.\n\nGoogle has also been working on improving its search functionality with its 'Understanding More' project. The initiative aims to help Google better comprehend natural language and provide more personalized results based on a user's location, interests, and previous searches. By understanding the nuances of human communication, Google hopes to deliver more relevant and useful results that match the user's intent.\n\nThese advancements in search engine technology signal a shift towards a more conversational approach to searching. Rather than relying solely on keyword matches, these platforms seek to understand the context and purpose behind a user's query, making it easier for them to find what they're looking for quickly and efficiently. As AI technology continues to improve, we can expect even more innovation in this space, further bridging the gap between user intent and search results.",
    "A growing crisis in the field of social sciences is threatening the future of research and academic freedom, experts have warned.\n\nAccording to a report published by the University of Cambridge, the increasing pressure to secure funding and the emphasis on \"impact\" in research evaluation are leading to a narrow focus on applied research, at the expense of fundamental research in the social sciences.\n\nThe report, titled \"The Future of Social Science Research: A Crisis of Relevance and Autonomy?\", argues that the shift towards applied research is resulting in a lack of investment in basic research, which is essential for advancing understanding and knowledge in the social sciences.\n\n\"The emphasis on impact and the drive for relevance has created a culture in which researchers feel compelled to produce research that is immediately applicable, rather than focusing on fundamental questions about human behavior and society,\" said Dr. Sarah Franklin, a co-author of the report.\n\nThe report also notes that the increasing reliance on external funding sources, such as government grants and private foundations, is leading to a loss of autonomy for researchers.\n\n\"Researchers are being forced to tailor their research to the interests of funders, rather than pursuing their own research interests and questions,\" said Dr. Franklin. \"This not only undermines the integrity of research, but also limits the scope of research that is available to us.\"\n\nThe report highlights several examples of how the crisis in social sciences is manifesting, including the decrease in the number of PhD students pursuing careers in academia, the decline in the number of papers published in top-tier journals, and the increasing reliance on temporary and insecure research positions.\n\nThe authors argue that the crisis in social sciences is not only a problem for academics, but also has broader implications for society.\n\n\"The social sciences play a crucial role in helping us understand the world around us and in addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing society, such as climate change, inequality, and the rise of authoritarianism,\" said Dr. Franklin. \"If we lose the ability to pursue fundamental research in the social sciences, we risk losing our ability to",
    "The 62nd Grammy Awards ceremony was filled with memorable moments, but one of the most poignant was when soul legend Charles was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nCharles, known for his smooth and soulful voice, has been a major figure in the music industry for over five decades. He has released numerous hit songs, including \"Georgia on My Mind\" and \"I've Got a Woman.\" His unique blend of gospel, blues, and jazz has made him a beloved artist among fans of all ages.\n\nThe tribute to Charles began with a heartfelt introduction by renowned singer-songwriter, Alicia Keys. She praised Charles' contributions to music, saying, \"He's a genius, a trailblazer, and a true icon. His music has touched our souls and inspired generations.\"\n\nKeys then introduced a special performance by Charles himself, who took the stage accompanied by a live band. Despite some health issues in recent years, Charles' voice still shone brightly as he sang a medley of his classic hits. The audience was captivated by his powerful rendition of \"What'd I Say,\" which had everyone in attendance swaying to the rhythm.\n\nFollowing the performance, the Recording Academy's President, Deborah Dugan, presented Charles with the Lifetime Achievement Award. In her speech, she highlighted Charles' remarkable career, stating, \"With his signature sound and unparalleled talent, Charles has left an indelible mark on the music world. This award is a testament to his enduring legacy and influence.\"\n\nA visibly moved Charles accepted the honor, expressing gratitude to his family, friends, and fellow musicians.

The previous record was 180 messages, set in 2017.\n\nThe feat was achieved by a team of experts using specialized software and a high-speed computer network. They worked tirelessly for months to develop a system that could send texts at an unprecedented rate, and their hard work paid off when they successfully broke the record during a live attempt on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are thrilled to have broken this record,\" said team leader John Smith. \"It's a testament to our dedication and expertise in the field of messaging technology.\"\n\nThe record-breaking attempt was witnessed by officials from Guinness World Records, who verified the achievement and presented the team with a certificate recognizing their accomplishment.\n\nThe team used a custom-built application that allowed them to send messages at incredible speeds, far faster than what is possible with traditional messaging apps. They also had to overcome technical challenges such as latency and server capacity to ensure that all 210 messages were delivered successfully within the one-minute time frame.\n\nWhile the record may seem impressive, it's worth noting that it's unlikely that anyone would need to send quite so many messages in such a short amount of time in real life. However, the achievement serves as a demonstration of the advancements that can be made in messaging technology, and paves the way for future innovations in communication.",

    "Girls are more likely to study, and be trained by companies, in key areas of information technology.\n\nThe results of a survey of more than 7000 people at the Women of Silicon Roundabout conference in London showed:\n\n- 71% of women work in software development, business analysis, testing or project management, versus 70% of men.\n\n- 75% of female apprentice or graduate trainees work in such areas, compared to 51% of men.\n\n- 68% of women hold an IT or computer science degree, compared to 52% of men.\n\nWomen in IT were more likely than men to believe \"women are paid less than men in the tech industry\", with 17% of women saying it was very likely as compared to 12% of men.\n\nAnd when asked about the \"proportion of women in senior roles\" in their organisation, 71% of women said they were very or moderately concerned about the number compared with 57% of men.\n\nOverall, the survey of both genders found:\n\n- 58% believed too few women were promoted to senior tech roles\n\n- 37% were moderately worried and 27% very worried about the gender gap\n\n- a third of those taking part thought their organisation took inadequate steps to close the gap\n\nIn its own survey of 39 organisations, which had 15,000 combined employees, a 2017 study by EY had concluded that women were less likely to secure career advancement in IT than men.\n\nFor example, of companies surveyed, 37% believed more male employees were promoted than women due to having more skills and experience.\n\n\"There's a great amount of concern that the gender gap exists [within technical teams],\" said Lorna Fitzsimons, partner at Accenture.\n\nAccenture has launched a mentoring programme to help women who want to develop their technical skills - but 26% of those taking part had declined to continue being mentored.\n\nAnd the survey revealed the reasons for this: 43% said they had less work to do",
    "The PlayStation 3's main chip has been revealed by Sony, which says it will be able to handle high-definition games and movies at up to 1080p resolution.\n\nSony said its Cell Broadband Engine would also allow for new types of gameplay that could not previously have been imagined.\n\nIt added that the chip was designed with future technologies in mind.\n\nHowever, analysts say the PS3 may struggle against rival consoles because of its price tag.\n\nThe Cell chip - developed jointly by IBM, Toshiba and Sony - contains eight processing cores, each capable of running independently or together as one unit.\n\nThis means that while one core can run an operating system, another can play a game, and yet another can display video content on screen.\n\nIn addition, the chip includes a graphics engine based on Nvidia technology, which allows for more realistic images than those seen on current generation machines such as Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii.\n\nSony said this meant that developers would be able to create games that were far more immersive than anything currently available.\n\nFor example, they might include real-time weather effects, or even let players interact with other people online without having to leave their living room.\n\n\"We believe that our next-generation console will offer users unprecedented levels of entertainment,\" said Kaz Hirai, president of Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA).\n\n\"With the introduction of the Cell Broadband Engine we are taking gaming into a whole new realm.\"\n\nAnalysts say that although the PS3 looks set to be a powerful machine, it faces stiff competition from rivals who already have established user bases.\n\nMicrosoft launched its Xbox 360 last year, while Nintendo released its Wii earlier this month. Both devices cost less than £250 ($479), compared with around £425 ($800) for the PS3.",
    "Two billion euros in cost cutting and an interest-free credit program helped lift DaimlerChrysler's profits by 7% to EUR6.3bn (£4.18bn), up from last year’s figure (EUR5.9bn) - but it was not enough for some investors who sold the company's shares on fears of a shortfall next month when the final results are reported. [In response,] Chief executive officer Jurgen Schrempp cut his salary by more than a quarter ($3.7m), saying he did this so that shareholders would “understand our efforts better”. In total about $US5m has been put back into the running costs, including a new system where top executives will receive stock options instead of bonuses depending on financial success. On Monday DaimlerChrysler announced its global car deliveries rose nearly 12 per cent overall during 2004. Deliveries were at their highest level since 1999 driven by strong growth in the United States and Asia Pacific. Overall, 2.5 million units were delivered worldwide in 2004, compared with 2.24 million units in the prior period. Last week General Motors posted fourth-quarter earnings well below analyst expectations as North American profit margins eroded under intense competition in its home market. GM also disclosed 24,000 white collar layoffs over the two years through December 2005 as part of plans to lower labour costs by $US2 billion. It reduced its forecast for production volume in Europe by half a percentage point due mainly to planned output cuts in Spain, Germany and France, to less than three per cent. While Ford announced its preliminary results only showed flat profits for the same nine months ended in September with revenue rising just one percent, or slightly faster than average industry prices.",
    "House prices in the UK have risen by almost 5% in the year to January, driven by resilient demand and ongoing supply shortage, according to new figures.\n\nThe Halifax said annual house price inflation stood at 4.9% in the first month of 2023 - more than tripling to 1.6% in the month.\n\nBut its rival index, from Nationwide, said prices had fallen for a quarter in a row, by 0.1%.\n\nHouse prices in England, Wales and Scotland have fallen by 2.4% over the past three months.\n\nNationwide said that decline means that, in year-to-date terms, prices are now only up by 0.8%.\n\nBoth economies said that the housing market was weak and that overall growth was weaker than the economy, where inflation is currently running at 10.5%.\n\nBut they did not expect much change on that front over the coming months.\n\n\"Overall, we expect housing market conditions to continue much as they are now in the first half of 2023, with prices weighed down by a decline in demand resulting from higher interest rates and a squeeze on household budgets,\" said Ruth Neville, Nationwide's chief economist.\n\n\"As a result, price growth is set to remain relatively subdued over the next year or so, despite a fall in interest rates, a continued shortage of properties for sale, and strong labour market conditions.\n\n\"We may even see small decreases in some months, similar to last year.\"\n\nRussell Galley, Halifax's managing director, said that demand and prices were still being underpinned by low supply, with stock down 36% on a year ago.\n\nThe average UK house price was £272,350, Halifax said, an increase of 1% in the month.\n\nThe average price was highest in London, where it reached £512,067, and lowest in Scotland where it stood at £170,605.\n\n\"Prices in December were 0.6% below their peak in June but we",

    "Four senior government ministers face allegations they made false statements to Commons select committees about secret surveillance by Britain's intelligence services, according to emails published on Tuesday.\n\nThe shadow attorney general Michael Dunkley released new evidence at this lunchtime which shows that: 1) former home minister Dennis Lister and national security minister Chris Fowler had been taped for several years by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS); and 2) former foreign minister Phil Swan was aware as early as August last year that he was being monitored by MI5 but withheld these facts until May's election campaign, when it became politically opportune to do so.\n\nThis revelation suggests Mr. Swain knew he was under investigation, yet allowed the Prime Minister to make a series of untruthful statement to MPs in an emergency debate on surveillance three months ago - although there remains no direct evidence in support of this suggestion. Indeed Mr. Swain denied this today - as reported below. So how did our top political journalists react? It depends who you are. On one side we have Dominic Lawson, writing his column for Sunday Times, which ran with a big story this weekend claiming the UK's system of checks & balances had broken down & now we can expect all sorts of abuses involving intelligence gathering and civil liberty violations. Mr Lawson writes \"there will be few in Mr Straw’s position who feel anything except contempt\" given he has made himself look like \"a buffoon\". But I suspect most of Mr's Lawson readers would share another sentiment expressed yesterday by Paul Sackville's at Conservative Home, namely dismay at not only Mr Straw's demeanor but also surprise that no sooner has John Reid resigned than he seems quite chummy with him in Parliament. In fact their recent behaviour suggests either a very clumsy cover up or alternatively perhaps they were never guilty of any wrongdoing whatsoever! Another aspect highlighted by Mr Lawson is just how shoddy the legal process appears given Lord Falconer claimed at an earlier hearing nobody could know they were under investigation despite the existence of clear and extensive court documents, which show otherwise.

    "3-D animation, flying babes, music from legendary songwriters and a Hollywood pedigree could get 'Saving Mr. Banks' off the ground. The movie, from Disney, tells the story of the making of the studio's 1964 Mary Poppins, which took 20 years to reach the screen. That film won five Oscars and spawned the song A Spoonful of Sugar. The new movie, which premiered on Tuesday, features Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as the English writer, P L Travers, who penned the books that inspired the first film. It was Ms Travers' determination to keep Disney honest to the source material that made the film adaptation so difficult and delayed. This film also stars Colin Farrell, Paul Giamatti and introduces Annie Rose Buckley, who is now 13, in the role of a young Travers. Disney executive Richard Schwartz was the co-coordinating producer on the new film and a vice president on the original. Like Travers, he says that Disney fought to make her characters suitable for filming. \"There's no talking penguins or singing cartoon animals or talking animals,\" says Schwartz. \"The story is all about how one family had problems and Mary Poppins came and fixed them all up.\"",

    "\"With the arrival of the iPhone, broadband access is likely to become a necessity as apps and services become available that rely on the increased bandwidth that a broadband connection offers. Google and Microsoft are both developing their own browsing software that aims to make the experience of using the web more rich and interesting, and their software will only work over a high bandwidth internet connection.\n\n\"Broadband usage is increasing despite rising prices\" is a news article from bbc.com. It is about how broadband usage is increasing despite rising prices. The article is written by Alexis Xenakis, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who is a researcher on cybercrime.\n\nWith the arrival of Netflix this year, broadband streaming should become an essential service in the U.S., since the video rental business is expected to explode. But the cost of high-speed internet connections is still prohibitively high for a lot of Americans. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, 14 percent of U.S. households have no internet connection, and the figures aren’t much better in other countries. So while Netflix has a lot of potential to build upon, broadband is not a guaranteed success.\n\nIn recent years, broadband has become a critical part of our day-to-day lives. Whether it is streaming movies, surfing the web or video calling friends at home, broadband is fast becoming a staple for the everyday consumer. The question arises as to why it matters and how high a priority it is for broadband providers. The answer is that broadband is much more than a luxury.\n\nIt is not just the internet that is important to us, but also the speed at which it can be delivered.\n\nBroadband internet is not just a fad. It is the future of the US, and it is coming soon.\n\nIt’s not just for the tech-savvy, it’s the future of work and life\n\nBroadband is the future of the US because it is the most affordable option for many Americans. It can be used to access the internet, stream videos and music, and make calls. There’s no need for a traditional telephone line (DSL) that costs hundreds of dollars to install, or hundreds more in",
    "The internet has become an essential part of our lives, but it's not always easy for everyone to get online.\n\nIn some parts of the world there are no fixed-line connections and mobile data can be expensive or unreliable.\n\nBut now a new technology called Long Term Evolution (LTE) could help bring high speed wireless access to more people than ever before.\n\nIt promises download speeds up to 10 times faster than current 3G networks - and that means you can do things like watch TV on your phone without having to wait ages for the video to buffer.\n\nSo how does LTE work? And what will it mean for us in the future?\n\n## What is LTE?\n\nLong Term Evolution is a standard developed by the telecommunications industry body known as the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). It was first introduced commercially in Sweden back in December 2009.\n\nThere are two main types of LTE network: FDD (Frequency Division Duplexing), which uses different frequencies for uploading and downloading; and TDD (Time Division Duplexing), where both functions share the same frequency band.\n\nBoth versions use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation techniques to send information over radio waves at much higher rates than previous technologies such as GSM and UMTS/WCDMA.\n\nThis allows them to carry far greater amounts of traffic while still maintaining good quality voice calls.\n\n## How fast is LTE?\n\nAccording to Ofcom, the UK regulator, average peak downlink speeds across all operators were around 4Mbps during Q1 2015. However, this figure varies widely depending upon location and operator coverage area.\n\nFor example, EE claims its customers enjoy typical download speeds between 8Mbps and 16Mbps whereas Vodafone says its users typically receive speeds ranging from 7Mbps to 12Mbps.\n\nThese figures represent maximum theoretical throughput rather than actual user experience due to factors including congestion, interference and signal strength.\n\nNevertheless, they give us an indication of potential performance levels under ideal conditions.\n\n## Why",

It will be my job to captain the side in my way, whether they like it or not.\"\n\nAhmed has enjoyed a successful start to the season with Sussex, but the club's promotion chances were damaged with heavy defeats by Hampshire and Surrey.\n\nSussex currently sit fourth in the Clydesdale Bank 40 table, whilst in one-day cricket they won only two of their opening six matches.\n\nAhmed, a former Bangladesh batsman, questioned if a club chairman would be happy to appoint the likes of Duncan Fletcher or Mike Brearley as full-time captain.\n\n\"That is a matter that the board will deal with,\" said Ahmed. \"A club chairman like Arsene Wenger would feel they are able to appoint someone of his calibre, but how many clubs have that kind of chairman?\"\n\nThe issue of non-playing captains has previously caused debate at Test level, with Giles himself filling that role for England against New Zealand in 2008, after Andrew Flintoff's retirement as captain. England went on to lose that series, though Giles guided them to the Twenty20 title less than a fortnight later, with captaincy duties again in his hands during the absence of Michael Vaughan.\n\nAhmed says he hopes Giles would consider a role within the Sussex set-up in a less taxing capacity.\n\n\"When he was around, he was great,\" said Ahmed. \"He could have the captain of the club in his position and help the side in the practice sessions.\"\n\n### 'Too heavy'\n\nAhmed said players needed to be involved in the decision-making process.\n\n\"The captain is always the player's captain,\" he",

    "International Development Secretary Clare Short has said she's disappointed by comments made by Lord Lloyd and Lord Goldsmith.\n\nThey said last weekend the International Development Secretary should have been more honest about the impact the human rights legislation would have had on the military campaigns in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan.\n\nBut she said they were wrong to suggest the government deliberately ignored their warnings.\n\nMeanwhile, Home Secretary David Blunkett said if their advice had been taken and people had suffered as a consequence then they were in the wrong.\n\nLord Lloyd told the Evening Standard and Sunday Telegraph the previous government's human rights legislation \"had been responsible for hampering the operation of the army in Sierra Leone\".\n\nHe said if the government had been more honest with him when it drafted the Human Rights Bill, which gave more rights to suspects and detainees, people may be walking around Sierra Leone who should not have been - including 700 members of an illegal rebel army who have never been brought to justice.\n\nLord Goldsmith, who was at the Foreign Office before becoming Attorney General, told Sunday's Observer he would have told the International Development Secretary not to sign the Memorandum of Understanding in 1998 with Sierra Leone.\n\nThis set out what Britain would do to stop the rebel groups from destabilising the region by training in Liberia.\n\nLord Goldsmith said he thinks the Sierra Leone war could have been stopped \"very quickly if there had been some action on the basis of this Memorandum of Understanding\".\n\n\"But that would have meant allowing some people to be detained for days without access to lawyers.

    "The Labour Party has been accused of distributing EU propaganda materials, despite its pledges to keep Britain out of European Union politics after Brexit. Critics say that some campaign materials seem eerily reminiscent of pro-European messaging, and include quotes from former EU leaders such as Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nIn particular, one leaflet was found in several polling stations across Wales and England, featuring claims that leaving the EU could jeopardise workers' rights, gender equality laws, and environmental protections. The flyer included images of EU flags over landmarks, including Big Ben, and featured slogans such as \"Let us stay under the protections of the Brussels bureaucracy\" and \"A new Tory government would leave us at the mercy of an uncompromising and hostile America.\"\n\nIt is unclear where these promotional materials came from or how they were distributed. However, critics argue that using quotes and branding associated with the EU is hypocritical given that the Labour Party supported leaving Europe during the 2016 referendum campaign. They also question the party's stance on issues it had previously campaigned on while still part of the European bloc.\n\nDefending the use of the materials, shadow chancellor John McDonnell stated that Labour is committed to protecting people's interests beyond borders, regardless of whether they exist within the UK's current political framework. \"We will continue to fight for what we believe is right, even if it means taking our message directly to European voters,\" he said.",
    "Today, a landmark decision was made by the Supreme Court of the United States regarding the death penalty case of Rodney King, an African American man who was fatally shot by police in Los Angeles, California. The court ruled that the conviction and sentencing were improperly obtained, and overturned the death sentence.\n\nThe case, which sparked widespread protests and riots across the United States, has been a significant point of contention in the ongoing debate over police violence and racial injustice in the US. The court's decision is a victory for those who have been fighting for justice and equality in this matter, and will undoubtedly lead to many other families seeking a similar outcome for their loved ones.\n\nThe ruling was based on strong evidence that was not presented to the grand jury in the original investigation, and that was not brought to the attention of trial jurors who did not hear the testimonies of key witnesses. The court also found that the prosecution's case was built on a faulty foundation, and that it was an unconstitutional violation of Mr. King's rights to a fair trial.\n\nThe decision, which was heralded by groups calling for police reform and racial justice, has already been hailed as a turning point in the fight for equality in America. The court's ruling serves as a reminder that everyone, regardless of their race or color, deserves fairness and justice under the law.\n\nHowever, the fight for justice is far from over. The ruling was a victory in this case, but there are many other cases of police brutality that need to be addressed. The court's decision will undoubtedly pave the way for other families and communities to challenge unjust practices and demand equal treatment under the law.\n\nAs civil rights leaders and advocates have long argued, true justice can only be achieved when everyone is held accountable for their actions, and when everyone is treated with respect and dignity. The ruling in the Rodney King case is an important first step in this process, and it is an affirmation of the fundamental principles of fairness and justice that underpin our society.",
    "Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy continued his impressive winning streak on the European Tour with a commanding victory at the Dubai Desert Classic on Sunday. McIlroy, who has won five tournaments in the past eight months, shot a final round of 66 to finish 18 under par and two clear of his nearest competitors.\n\nThe impressive performance is a further indication of McIlroy's form, which has been in exceptional shape since his victory at the Open Championship in July. During that period, McIlroy has finished outside the top-10 only once and has accumulated an impressive 273 points on the European Tour, putting him 21 points clear of the second-placed player.\n\nMcIlroy attributed his success to a combination of factors, including a strong work ethic and a focus on improving his game. \"I've been working hard and putting in a lot of practice,\" he said. \"I've also been fortunate enough to have some great people around me who help me stay grounded and focused.\"\n\nWith four more tournaments left to play in the current season, McIlroy will be hoping to continue his remarkable run of form and secure his second straight Ryder Cup appearance. The Northern Irishman has already proven himself to be one of the most dominant players on the European Tour and will be a force to be reckoned with in the years to come.",

    "Mobiles are becoming increasingly powerful devices, with new functionalities added and more advanced hardware being used to create them. However, some experts still believe that they have not fully fulfilled their potential as a medium for sharing information and entertainment content.\n\nAccording to a report by technology research firm Forrester Research, mobile phones are no ready to be considered true media players just yet. The report states that while smartphones are becoming more capable of playing back various forms of digital audio and video, there is still much work to be done before they can rival dedicated multimedia devices such as televisions or computers.\n\nOne major issue with mobile phones is screen size. While many models now boast HD displays, most are still small enough to make viewing content uncomfortable, especially on extended periods of time. Additionally, issues such poor battery life, limited storage space, and compatibility problems continue to plague users looking to consume media through their mobiles.\n\nHowever, developers are working hard to address these challenges and improve the mobile experience. Advances in streaming technologies, for example, allow users to stream high-quality music and videos directly from their phone without having to download large files first. This has provided a seamless listening and viewing experience for both casual shoppers and serious fans alike. Another promising development is 4K HDR TV capabilities, which will bring live sports events, movies & TV shows to mobile screens with sharper resolution & vivid colors.\n\nIn summary, while mobile phones continue to evolve and become more versatile, we are still awaiting the day when they truly reach the level of media consumption dominance enjoyed today by television sets and personal computers.",
    "The Labour Party has chosen Manchester as its first major city to commit to after the Brexit referendum. The city's mayor, Andy Burnham, announced the move on Friday, saying it was a sign that Labour was committed to investing in the UK's towns and cities. The decision was seen as a response to a growing sense of disillusionment in Manchester, a city with a large Brexit-voting population. The move could also be seen as a bid to win back support from voters who turned their backs on Labour in the 2016 European Union referendum. Burnham said the party had committed to investing £100 million in Manchester's transport, housing and digital infrastructure over the next five years, and that he is confident that the city can become a hub for innovation and growth. \"We are not complacent about the challenges ahead, but we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead,\" he said. The move is expected to be welcomed in Manchester, where many residents feel that the government has given the city short shrift since the referendum. Burnham has been working closely with the city's leaders to address concerns about poverty, unemployment and crime in the city. The move is seen as a key step in Labour's plans to regain support in the North and Midlands, which were hit hardest by the Brexit vote. Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham's statement on Friday.",
    "High-definition (HD) technology is set to revolutionize the DVD industry in several ways. With the growing popularity of streaming services and high-definition TV sets, DVDs are looking increasingly obsolete. However, new technologies being developed for DVDs may help them stay relevant for a little longer.\n\nOne of the main advantages of HD technology is that it allows for higher resolution and improved image quality. This means that DVDs that are upgraded to high-definition will look significantly better than their standard definition counterparts. For example, new technologies such as Blu-ray and Ultra HD (4K) have been developed to deliver crystal-clear video with stunning detail and vibrant colors.\n\nIn addition, HD technology has made it possible to record 3D movies, which is another way that DVDs may continue to stay relevant. With the rise of 3D TVs, 3D movies will soon be available on DVD, allowing users to experience movies in a completely new and immersive way.\n\nAnother way that HD technology is being used to improve DVDs is through the use of interactive features. With the help of HD technologies, DVDs can now offer touch-screen interfaces, motion-controlled games, and other interactive features that would be impossible to implement with standard definition technology.\n\nHowever, despite these advances, it is clear that DVDs are not going to be able to compete with the convenience of streaming services and the latest TV technologies for much longer. As such, it is likely that the DVD industry will continue to evolve and develop new technologies to keep it relevant in an increasingly digital world.",

    "In November 2020, the world was hit with the shocking news that American video game developer, Activision Blizzard, was facing legal action from shareholders who accused the company of underperforming its financial targets. The allegations led to a significant drop in the stock price of the company, and many investors are calling for major changes in the company's leadership.\n\nAt the heart of this controversy is the founder of the company, Bobby Kotick, who has faced criticism for his long-standing practice of hiding financial information from shareholders. Kotick, who has been CEO of Activision since its founding in 1975, has maintained that his focus is on the long-term growth of the company, rather than short-term profit.\n\nHowever, some see Kotick's actions as a short-sighted move that threatens the company's ability to compete in the fast-paced video game industry. The allegations by shareholders, combined with the drop in stock price, have led to concerns about Activision's ability to survive and compete in the industry.\n\nDespite these challenges, Kotick remains committed to the success of Activision. He has spoken publicly about the company's plans to continue to invest in new technologies and expansion into new markets, and has expressed confidence in the company's future.\n\n\"I have never been more optimistic about the future of Activision Blizzard,\" Kotick said in a statement. \"We have a talented team of executives and developers, and we are constantly working to create new and innovative games that inspire our players around the world.\"\n\nWhether or not Activision Blizzard can overcome these challenges remains to be seen. The company is currently facing a hostile takeover bid from Microsoft, and shareholders are calling for change in the company's leadership.\n\nBut even amid these controversies, Kotick remains committed to the long-term success of Activision. \"I have never been happier with the direction of the company, and I am excited about what the future holds for Activision Blizzard,\" he says.",
    "Sir Howard Davies, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs and former Governor of the Bank of England, has many achievements under his belt. However, there are still some areas of business that he has not completed, including his work on environmental issues.\n\nDavies has been an advocate for sustainable finance, and has spoken extensively on the need for companies to integrate environmental and social considerations into their business practices. His efforts in this area have earned him praise and recognition from many, but there is still much work to be done to promote more sustainable finance practices.\n\nOne issue that Davies has not addressed in depth is the potential for conflicts of interest to arise in the financial industry, as companies may prioritize their own profits over the interests of the environment and society. He has called for greater oversight and regulation in this area, and has urged companies to be more transparent and accountable for their environmental and social impact.\n\nAnother area of unfinished business for Davies is his work on the issue of climate change. He has spoken extensively on the need for companies to take responsibility for their carbon emissions and to invest in renewable energy and other sustainable solutions. However, he has also acknowledged that there is still much work to be done to move the financial industry towards a more sustainable future, and to ensure that businesses are incentivized to do so.\n\nOverall, Sir Howard Davies remains a leading voice in the fight for sustainable finance, and his unfinished business in this area serves as a reminder of the importance of continued effort and progress in this critical pursuit.",

Kelly has been vocal in promoting alternative medicine and homeopathy, and has been criticized by some in the scientific community for her lack of evidence to back up her claims.\n\nScientists have been quick to slam the views of Kelly, saying that alternative medicine and homeopathy have no proven effectiveness. Many have also pointed out that Kelly's claims of alternative cures for cancer and other diseases often go against the established medical community's understanding of these conditions.\n\nThe concerns about Kelly's views come at a time when the government is looking into alternative medicine, homeopathy, and other forms of complementary medicine.

    "The rise in council tax for 2018-19 has been described as \"reasonable\" by Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid.\n\nThe announcement follows a series of discussions with local authorities across England, which were asked to submit their proposals for next year's budget. This is a necessary step towards ensuring that councils have the resources they need to provide essential services to residents.\n\nIt is important to note that the national average increase of just over one per cent falls within the range set out by the government earlier this year. Councils were encouraged to consider raising council tax as part of their overall financial plans, but only after all other options to maximize revenue had been exhausted.\n\nUnder the current system, it is up to individual councils to decide on setting their own rate levels based on factors such as population growth, demand for services and the efficiency of their delivery. It is therefore understandable that some areas require an increase above the national average to meet their budgetary requirements.\n\nAs responsible stewards of public funds, it is incumbent upon every authority to make the best use possible of those available to them. By doing so, they will be able to ensure the continued delivery of high-quality services for our communities at the most efficient financial cost.",

    "Yukos, the former Russian oil giant, has launched lawsuits against four companies in the United States, seeking damages of more than $20 billion in a dispute over the ownership of a Siberian oil field. The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in Manhattan, names as defendants Chevron, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell. The case revolves around the oil field in the Khanty-Mansiysk region of Siberia, where Yukos had a 90% stake until it was sold to a private company in 2003 for $311 million. The sale was later revealed to be fraudulent, and last year a Russian court ordered the return of the assets to the state, including the oil field. Yukos is now seeking to recover the assets and claims that the four companies knew about the fraudulent sale and should therefore return the money they received from it.",

    "A new initiative introduced by the government has proposed a reduction of the legal drink-driving limit in Scotland, which officials claim would help reduce the number of road accidents caused by intoxicated drivers. The current limit, which is set at 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood, is being considered for reduction to 50 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood, a move that has been broadly supported by healthcare professionals and road safety advocates.\n\nThe move comes in the wake of numerous studies that have shown a direct correlation between alcohol consumption and road accidents. At the current limit, drivers with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 80 milligrams or above are considered to be over the limit and could face serious legal consequences if caught driving. However, research has shown that even small amounts of alcohol can impair a driver's ability to operate a vehicle safely.\n\nSupporters of the initiative argue that reducing the legal limit will help to deter drink-driving and ultimately reduce the number of accidents on the roads. \"There is a clear link between alcohol consumption and road accidents,\" said Dr. Ewan McVey, a road safety expert at the University of Edinburgh. \"By reducing the legal limit, we can help to reduce the number of people who are killed or injured on our roads each year.\"\n\nHowever, the move has also been criticized by some groups, who argue that it will disproportionately affect social drinkers and could lead to increased police intervention. \"There is a risk that the new limit will lead to increased police stops and potentially unfair targeting of social drinkers,\" said John Boyd, a spokesperson for the Scottish Beer and Pub Industry Federation. \"We need to be careful that we don't end up punishing the vast majority of responsible drinkers for the actions of a minority.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the government remains committed to implementing the new limit, which is expected to come into effect next year. Public health officials estimate that the move could ultimately prevent up to 450 road deaths each year in Scotland.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the new proposed limit of 50mg/100ml is still higher",

Maiman has tasked the club with expanding its reach beyond Israel and identifying new opportunities for growth.\n\n\"Israel is a small market, and it's important for us to seek out new partnerships and opportunities,\" Maiman said. \"Africa is a dynamic and growing market, and we believe that by forming relationships with African clubs, we can tap into this potential and increase our competitiveness on the global stage.\"\n\nHaYa'alom has already established contact with several African clubs, including AS Monaco, a French club with headquarters in Morocco, and Al-Shams, an Egyptian club. The club is considering joint training camps and tournaments, as well as exchange programs for players and coaches, as part of its partnership initiatives.\n\nThe move by HaYa'alom to explore partnerships with African clubs is part of a wider trend in the football industry.

The UK has been forced to negotiate new trade agreements with individual countries to replace those with the EU.\n\n\"The trade deficit is still a concern, and we will continue to work closely with all our trading partners to ensure fair and free trade for UK businesses,\" said International Trade Secretary Liz Truss.\n\nOverall, the fourth quarter saw the UK's fastest rate of export growth since the second quarter of 2018, with exports rising by 4.5% in value terms and by 1.6% in volume terms.",
    "Chelsea has earned a hard-fought win over West Ham, thanks in large part to the contributions of their star players Frank Lampard and John Terry. As usual, Lampard was central to the action, taking a key role in several of Chelsea's attacks. He was unlucky not to score a fourth goal for Chelsea, narrowly missing a header from a corner. Terry, meanwhile, was an outstanding defensive force, making several key blocks and tackles to keep West Ham's attacks at bay. Overall, their combined performance helped guide Chelsea to a satisfying victory, and strengthened their position at the top of the Premier League table.\n\nChelsea is currently in third place, with a record of 12 victories and a single draw.

    "Gadget market 'to grow in 2005'\nBy Phil Lutton\nPersonal technology is set to boom in 2005 with sales of MP3 players, hand-held video games and cameras expected to reach record levels, analysts predict. In 2004, sales of personal technology products topped $78bn (£44bn) worldwide, but that figure is set to grow to $80bn.\nAccording to market researcher In-Stat/MDR, sales of digital cameras and MP3 players alone will top $12bn and $4bn in 2005 globally.\nThere are already 1.2bn digital cameras in the world and by the end of 2005 there will be 635m MP3 players.\nThe popularity of iPod Nano has also generated sales for accessories companies. Apple claims the $299 Nano sold out in six days -- the company has not yet confirmed when restocking will take place.\nMobile phone sales will grow too. In 2005, 400m phones will be sold worldwide -- compared to 330m in 2004. According to analysts at CCS Insight, this is due to the continuing drop in prices and a greater choice of phones for consumers.\nBut 2005 will also see the death of the PDAs -- personal digital assistants are being surpassed by smart phones which are fast becoming mini-computers in their own right and are beginning to offer the same functionality.\nMotorola's A840 for example has a 2-megapixel camera, a 2.2-inch QVGA display with 65k colours, an expandable memory of 150mb, and a built-in MPEG-4 player and Bluetooth.\nThe most significant trend in hand-held technology in 2005 will be the launch of 3G. 3G -- which stands for third-generation -- promises much faster data rates and enhanced multimedia services. The first 3G hand-sets are expected to hit the market in 2005 and there will be 1.6bn handsets with 3G capabilities by 2010, according to analysts IDC.\n2005 also marks the beginning of IPTV -- interactive television -- services over the Internet. These are expected to have the same effect on the world as the introduction of broadband had several years ago. By 2010, 30% of new television services will be offered as a download via the Internet, in the form of high-definition IPTV content, according to In-",

    "\"Britain's defence budget is unaffordable and cannot be increased, says a think-tank's annual defence report. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) says other areas of public spending should be trimmed and taxes raised to pay for what it calls 'a minimum' defence of the nation and to help tackle youth unemployment. It criticised the decision to increase the number of aircraft carriers being built.\"\nI'm happy to see the BBC is still reporting on defence spending issues. It's also pretty refreshing to read their story on the report as well, which doesn't just focus on the headlines like most stories on this subject.\nIt's ironic, however, that the government has been accused of not spending money on national defence by the IPPR. The report says \"the UK's defence budget will be below the NATO norm by 2018/19\", but that is wrong. I would say we are spending between 2-3% of GDP on defence, which is pretty average for our North- Atlantic partners. In fact, the figures are pretty close to that of the US, who spends about 4% of GDP.\nThis is how defence spending has evolved since the end of the Cold War, when NATO was still fighting in the Balkans (Kosovo, Bosnia, etc) with the lowest defence budget on record:\nIt can be seen that the defence budget peaked in 1997-98 (~6,5% of GDP), then decreased in the early 2000s, followed by a sharp reduction in 2004, when a massive peacekeeping operation in Afghanistan was launched. In 2010, we hit the low point. In 2011, the budget was significantly increased to support the operations in Afghanistan and Libya.\nIn 2013, with the end of combat operations in Afghanistan, Defence got a small additional boost. But a majority of this increase actually went to the budget of the Foreign Office as part of the 'development-aid-and-security' fusion strategy pursued by the coalition government. As such, there was no major budget increase for the armed forces.\nBy 2014, the defence budget will have dropped again, back to the budget level in 2010. The coalition government has insisted in recent years that this was in response to the end of the combat mission in Afghanistan and a cut in the defence equipment programme which includes the procurement of aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy.\nBut if this is the explanation of defence's budget",
    "The way computer networks carry and process data has a distinct pattern - one which a thief or hack may be able to exploit.\nSo the BBC has developed a new technique to detect traffic-shaping, which is being piloted on a live system.\nThe work could help prevent attacks on a network and has potential for use as a \"fingerprint\" on the Internet.\nSecurity professionals will be among those who read about traffic fingerprinting techniques with scepticism and some amusement. Yet a decade or so ago many were sceptical and amused about packet sniffing. So what does traffic fingerprinting actually mean?\nThe BBC's definition, based on the work of the BBC Research and Development Department, is that every network-based device has its own characteristics which can be observed and detected at a low level.\nThere is no new technology here, and the term does not include content-matching.\nSome of the technical details may have been kept secret. Nonetheless this can be explained using plain English and with reference to other work in the field.\nIf you can detect a network node in that sense, you can create rules to detect its patterns. If that approach is taken to an arbitrary device on the Internet, you can develop a fingerprinting device which can be used to \"fingerprint\" or detect traffic patterns in the Internet - or what the BBC terms a \"fingerprinting router\" (FR).\nThis work is novel because the FR is a \"live\" device and the fingerprinting is carried out on the fly on a real Internet router.\nOther work on network fingerprinting has included attempts to fingerprint TCP (transmission control protocol) and UDP (user datagram protocol), but FRs detect patterns in the lower layers; at OSI levels 4-7.\nThese lower layers are responsible for fragmentation of packets and the use of protocol stack functions. In each case, it is the order and length of these functions performed by the FR that creates the fingerprint.\nWhat does this mean for traffic shaping or detecting traffic-shaping? Traffic shaping is carried out on content at any time. If you cannot detect the FR, the FR can manipulate traffic without detection or without creating a signature. If detected, the FR may either stop that action or modify its action.\nBut once the FR has been identified, traffic shaping can be stopped. This can be done with the application of a rule that can stop",
    "\"A US appeals court has upheld the convictions of two men accused of organising a network for illegal file-sharing. The two were convicted of conspiracy and racketeering, with a maximum penalty of a life sentence. The case represents the US government's most aggressive effort yet against the file-sharing industry. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan overturned a ruling that overturned convictions against Joel Tenenbaum, 29, and Jammie Thomas, 26. The men were charged in 2006 with operating a massive network of software that enabled users to illegally download music and other material.\"\nAOL says it has cut off its services to the file sharing program BitTorrent Inc. \"We have been contacted by the Recording Industry Association of America and other rightsholders to remove our users' access to the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol and service,\" the company, which is now known as Aol Time Warner Inc., said in a brief news release.\nA news reporter writes: \"A judge said Thursday he'll rule Jan. 25 on what he called 'an extraordinary motion' made by plaintiffs in a high-profile music file-sharing lawsuit to stop Napster from operating. U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Hall Patel wants to know who will run Napster if the company is put into receivership, which she said will probably be necessary to stop its operations and let two record companies recoup millions of dollars in damages for illegal file sharing. Patel said she'd consider appointing former Napster executive Hank Barry if the plaintiffs can show he can run the company by Jan. 7. 'I can't imagine a more outrageous motion than the one that's being presented to this court today,' plaintiff attorney Thomas Wiesner told Patel, who was visibly shaken by the request.\nA news reporter writes: \"Sony Music has lost a court case with British file-sharing service Songbird over the use of its logo and brand name.

    "For the second year running, British hurdler Colin Jackson has beaten Britain's Olympic gold medal contender Derrick Atkinson to an award. World and Olympic champion Linford Christie was voted by the press as the World's Best Athlete.\nA panel of expert judges selected the 100 metre men and the best men's and women's middle-distance runners, with the rest down to public vote at bbc.co.uk. Jackson took the 100 men award, after failing even to make it onto the shortlist last year. The sprint hurdler, who won silver in the 100m at the 1996 Olympics, came second in the public vote with 5% of the tally, behind the Olympic and world champion Michael Johnson with 26%. The 100m sprint was decided by 100 voters, with Johnson and Jackson each getting 38 and third-placed Canadian Ben Johnson getting 14. Jackson's double Olympic gold medallist compatriot Sally Gunnell won the women's 100 title, beating Merlene Ottey of Jamaica by a big margin.\nOlivia Granville won the women's 400m award. The 20-year-old won her first major international title in 1997, beating the defending Olympic champion Caterine Ibarguren in the European Championships, but failed to get a single vote in the 100m category, which was won by Jackson. In the women's 400m, she got 12% of the vote, ahead of the double world champion Maria Mutola, who received 26% and Ibarguren, who was third with 18%. The World Athletics Grand Prix Series winner in 1997, Ottey won her first world title in the 200m in Rome but was denied gold in the 400m final, after a controversial photo-finish. Ottey's second place was more than her compatriot and rival Merlene Ottey, who won the 800m vote with 22%, ahead of the double world champion Jearl Miles-Clark, who beat the Russian Jutta Heine with 14%.\nAmanda Coetzer of South Africa, winner of the WTA Singles Championship, won the women's tennis award, with 28%, ahead of the second-placed Belgian player Justine Henin with 21% and French number one Nathalie Tauziat with 13%.

    "Europe is seeking financial assistance from Asia to help stabilize the eurozone economy, as the region struggles to recover from a crippling debt crisis.\n\nIn a bid to boost economic ties with Asia, European leaders have announced plans to visit key financial hubs in the region, including Tokyo, Beijing and Singapore, in the coming months.\n\nThe move comes as the European Central Bank (ECB) continues to purchase sovereign bonds from struggling eurozone countries in an attempt to keep borrowing costs under control.\n\nHowever, some analysts have warned that the ECB's efforts may not be enough to stabilize the eurozone economy in the long-term, and that Europe may need to look elsewhere for financial support.\n\nAsia, with its rapidly growing economies and vast reserves of cash, is seen as a potential source of support for the struggling eurozone.\n\n\"Asia is an increasingly important player in the global economy and we want to strengthen our economic ties with the region,\" said European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.\n\n\"We are confident that by deepening our economic relationship with Asia, we can create new opportunities for growth and jobs in both regions.\"\n\nHowever, some Asian leaders have expressed reservations about providing financial assistance to Europe, citing concerns over the eurozone's long-term economic prospects.\n\n\"We are willing to help, but only if the eurozone takes concrete steps to address its underlying economic issues,\" said Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.\n\nNevertheless, many analysts believe that closer economic ties between Europe and Asia could bring significant benefits to both regions, boosting trade and investment flows and helping to drive global economic growth.\n\n\"Asia and Europe have a lot to gain from deeper economic integration,\" said Dr. John Lee, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution.\n\n\"By working together, we can help to address some of the major challenges facing the global economy, such as slowing growth and high unemployment.\"",
    "Japanese officials have declared that inflation has been brought under control, even as concerns over its effects on economic growth persist. The announcement comes amid fears that falling prices could lead to stagnant wages and weaken consumption demand.\n\nThe Bank of Japan recently implemented negative interest rates in an effort to stimulate spending amidst slumping consumer confidence and business investment. However, some experts argue that these measures may be insufficient for reversing years of low-grade price declines.\n\nDespite acknowledging ongoing challenges, government spokespersons emphasized recent successes in addressing income inequality by boosting public works projects nationwide. Officials also credited proactive monetary policy aimed at reducing unemployment levels below 3%, which they say is key to maintaining stable pricing environments going forward.\n\nWhile conceding there remains much work left undone given deeprooted structural issues within Japane's economy such as ageing demographics & corporate governance reform needed more broadly; policymakers signaled optimism about future prospects based largely upon their perceived progress thus far despite lingering uncertainties surrounding global trade tensions impacting both domestic exports external supply chains alike heavily weighing down overall outlook uncertainly surrounds us still clouded skies today but we hold hope knowing tomorrow brings new opportunities brighter skys ahead if only dare look towards them optimistically moving forth steadfast unwavering commitment stabilizing achieving sustainable strong resilient robust recovery rebounding triumphantly rebound comeback rise phoenix risen ascendance ascent conquering adversity challenge overcoming odds odds stacked against stacking deck spitefully oppositional resistance hostile obstructivism obstructive hinderances hindrances stumbling blocks roadblocks impediments hurdles obstructions deterrents detractions disruptions distractors drag anchors weigh anchor shackles manacles fetters bonds captivity confines imprisons incarcerates restraints locks cages prisons pens camps stockades fortresses towers keeps castles citadels strongholds palaces mansions chateaus villas estates mansion houses bungalows cottages shacks hovels huts sheds cabins wigwams tepees tipis longhouses yurts igloos tents teepees lodges halls gymnasium auditoria spaces rooms dwellings habitats abodes domiciles residences properties housing accommodations real estate home sweet homes nests couch potato niches dwelling places habitations locales locations addresses venues addresses spots sites areas zones neighborhoods sections precincts enclaves regions boroughs quarters townships parishes counties civil parish districts wards territories jurisdictions administrative divisions",
    "William Hague, former British Foreign Secretary and current leader of the House of Commons, has reportedly earned more than £600,000 in speaking fees over the past three years. According to documents obtained by The Telegraph under freedom of information laws, Mr. Hague received payments ranging from £15,001 to £25,000 for speeches given at events around the world.\n\nThe revelations come as public concern grows about the large sums of money earned by politicians and other figures after they leave office. Critics argue that such earnings can create conflicts of interest and undermine public trust in democracy.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Mr. Hague defended his actions, stating that he had declared all relevant interests and followed the rules set out by parliament. He also pointed out that many retired politicians earn similar amounts through writing books or giving lectures.\n\nHowever, Labour MP Chris Bryant called for stricter regulations on post-political earnings, saying that it was \"completely unacceptable\" for ex-politicians to profit so handsomely from their connections and influence.\n\nOverall, while William Hague's earnings may be within the bounds of legality and common practice, the controversy surrounding them highlights ongoing debates about transparency, accountability, and the potential conflicts inherent in the transition between political power and private enterprise.",
    "The weak dollar has hit news agency Reuters, with the company announcing a 17% drop in revenue for the third quarter. The decline was largely attributed to the impact of currency fluctuations on the company's revenue.\n\nReuters, which is one of the world's largest news agencies, said that the weakening of the dollar had led to a decrease in revenue from the United States, which accounts for a significant portion of the company's business.\n\nAlthough the company's revenue from the United States declined by 14%, revenue from the rest of the world also fell, indicating that the weak dollar is having a broader impact on the company's business.\n\nDespite the decline in revenue, Reuters said that it remained committed to its digital transformation strategy, which involves investing in new products and technology to increase its online presence.\n\nThe company's shares fell by 5% on the news, illustrating the impact that currency fluctuations can have on businesses with a global presence.",
    "JP Morgan, one of the largest financial institutions in the world, has admitted that it profited from slavery in the 19th century. The bank's predecessors, the Manhattan Company and the Mercantile Safe Deposit Company, held shares in insurance companies that benefited from slavery.\n\nIn a statement, JP Morgan said it was \"deeply sorry\" for its ties to slavery and would be taking steps to address the issue. The bank will be creating a reparations fund and investing in organizations that support diversity and inclusion.\n\nThis admission comes as many companies are being held accountable for their ties to slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. Last year, the British government set up a commission to investigate reparations for slavery and the slave trade, and several other countries have followed suit.\n\nJP Morgan's admission is a significant step towards acknowledging and addressing the role that financial institutions played in supporting slavery. It remains to be seen how other banks and companies will respond to this growing movement towards accountability and reparations.",
    "Jose Mourinho has once again showcased his managerial prowess this season, as his team continues to impress in all competitions.

It seems that Mourinho's success is not limited to just one competition, as he has also guided his team to the final of the Carabao Cup, where they will face bitter rivals Manchester City.\n\nWith Mourinho's impressive track record, it is clear that he is determined to lead his team to glory this season, and fans will be hoping that his team can continue their impressive form until the very end.",

    "The UK government has announced that it will be scrapping its controversial anti-spam screensaver initiative, following widespread criticism from both the public and tech experts.\n\nThe initiative, which was designed to block unwanted spam emails, required internet service providers to install a screensaver-style tool on customers' devices that would automatically activate if they were deemed to be sending too many spam emails.\n\nHowever, the plan was met with widespread criticism, with many arguing that it was a violation of privacy and could potentially cause significant technical issues for users.\n\nA spokesperson for the UK government said: \"After careful consideration, we have decided to scrap the anti-spam screensaver initiative. We understand the concerns raised by the public and tech experts, and we want to ensure that we are taking all necessary steps to protect people's privacy while also tackling the issue of spam emails.\"\n\nThe decision to scrap the initiative comes after a recent report by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office, which found that the plan could potentially breach data protection laws.\n\nThe government has said that it will now be exploring alternative ways to tackle the issue of spam emails, including working with internet service providers and tech companies to develop more effective solutions.",

    "George Galloway, former Respect Party leader and current Member of Parliament for Bradford West, has launched an attack on one of his fellow MPs who he claims is part of “New Labour”. In a fiery speech delivered in Westminster yesterday, Mr. Galloway singled out Imran Hussain, the MP for Wakefield, accusing him of being too close to Prime Minister Tony Blair’s government.\n\nMr. Galloway accused Mr. Hussain of betraying his constituents by voting in favor of controversial bills such as the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act, which many critics argue undermines civil liberties. He also criticized Mr. Hussain for failing to speak out against Britain's involvement in the Iraq War.\n\nIn response to Mr. Galloway's accusations, Mr. Hussain defended his record as an MP, stating that he has always acted in the best interests of his constituency and has consistently opposed policies that he believes are wrong. However, he acknowledged that there may be differences between himself and Mr. Galloway on certain issues.\n\nThe feud between the two MPs has been brewing for some time, with Mr. Galloway previously describing New Labour as a \"fascist\" organisation.

    "In a landmark case that has far-reaching implications for the world of sport, a top athlete has been banned from competition for using performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nThe athlete in question is none other than Sarah Collins, a former world champion and one of the most recognizable faces in her sport. Collins, who has been suspended for four years, has admitted to taking a banned substance in a bid to improve her performance.\n\nThe decision to ban Collins, who has also been stripped of all her results from the relevant period, has been welcomed by anti-doping organizations, who have long called for tougher penalties for athletes caught cheating.\n\nCollins's ban is the latest in a series of high-profile cases involving doping in sport, and underscores the ongoing struggle to ensure fair play and maintain the integrity of competition.\n\nThe case also highlights the importance of rigorous drug testing and the need for athletes to be aware of the risks associated with using performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nCollins, who has yet to comment on the ruling, is likely to appeal the decision, but in the meantime, her absence from competition is sure to have a significant impact on her sport, and on the athletes who will now have to step up to fill the void left by one of its most dominant figures.",
    "In an unprecedented admission, JP Morgan has acknowledged that it profited from slavery in the United States during the 19th century. The banking giant said it had discovered through research that its predecessor firms played a role in financing the slave trade and supporting plantations that relied on forced labor. \n\nThe revelation comes as part of a growing movement among companies to examine their histories for any ties to slavery or other forms of exploitation. Many corporations have found such connections despite efforts over decades or even centuries to distance themselves from these dark chapters in American history.\n\n\"We recognize that our predecessors were involved in activities that were morally wrong and diametrically opposed to our company's values today,\" Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a statement. \"As we've studied our own history, we've found instances where our firm and its predecessors were connected to aspects of this shameful period.\"\n\nJPMorgan specifically cited two New York-based banks that merged with it in the late 1800s: the Manhattan Company and the Mercantile National Bank. Both institutions financed Southern plantation owners who depended on enslaved laborers, according to the bank's analysis.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that many businesses benefited from the institution of slavery, few have been willing to confront their past head-on like JPMorgan has done. The acknowledgment represents a significant step towards confronting America's complicated relationship with race and wealth.",

    "The UK Government has announced plans to strip British citizenship from individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism, making it easier for them to be deported to their country of origin. The move comes amid growing concerns over extremism and the radicalization of young people in Britain. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said that the proposal was designed to help tackle the threat posed by jihadist ideologies and ensure that those who pose a risk to national security cannot use British citizenship as a shield. Critics, however, have described the policy as \"draconian\" and questioned its constitutional validity, with some arguing that it could lead to innocent people being wrongly deprived of their nationality. Amnesty International also warned that the measure would set a dangerous precedent for other countries around the world looking to crack down on dissent and opposition. Whether the proposed law will pass through parliament remains uncertain at this stage, but if approved, it is likely to face legal challenges before coming into effect.",

    "Independent record labels are set to benefit from new technology that will allow them to sell their music directly to fans through digital downloads, it has been announced. The development comes as part of efforts to level the playing field between independent and major labels, who have traditionally had greater access to distribution channels.\n\nThe new system allows independents to upload their tracks onto an online platform, where they can then be purchased by customers. Revenue generated from these sales will be split fairly between the label and the artist involved, with both receiving a larger share than would typically be the case through traditional retail outlets.\n\nAccording to industry experts, this move could revolutionize the way in which independent artists distribute their work, giving them more control over their creative output and potentially increasing their earnings. It is hoped that the initiative will also help to support smaller labels, many of which struggle to compete against the financial clout of multinational corporations.\n\nSpeaking about the announcement, one independent label owner praised the move as \"a game-changer\" for the sector, while another described it as \"long overdue\". They added that the ability to sell direct to consumers was crucial in an increasingly crowded market, where securing shelf space or airtime could be difficult.\n\nDetails of the scheme were unveiled at a conference aimed at promoting the interests of independent musicians and labels. Delegates heard how the platform - due to launch later this year - aims to provide a simple and cost-effective solution for those looking to reach a wider audience without relying on traditional intermediaries.\n\nWhile some critics have expressed concerns about the potential impact on established retailers, supporters of the plan argue that it offers a vital lifeline to talented but overlooked artists. They hope that the increased exposure and revenue opportunities provided by the platform will encourage further innovation and creativity within the indie community.",
    "British shoppers have demonstrated their Christmas spirit with strong retail sales figures, according to latest data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nThe ONS revealed that in November, UK high streets and shopping centres saw an increase of 4% compared to last year's figures, marking the strongest growth since March this year.\n\nExperts attribute this surge in spending to consumers' eagerness to kick-start celebrations after months of restrictions due to the pandemic, as well as retailers offering attractive discounts ahead of the holiday season.\n\nBrick-and-mortar stores witnessed significant footfall during the month, while online sales also rose by 2%, indicating a broad-based recovery across various sectors of the economy.\n\nClothing and footwear shops recorded the highest spike in sales at 8.7%; however, other categories such as food, drink, and household goods also registered substantial gains.\n\nWhile these numbers are encouraging signs of consumer confidence bouncing back, experts caution against reading too much into one month's worth of data, especially given ongoing concerns about rising infections and tighter lockdown measures in some parts of the country.\n\nNonetheless, the robust performance of retail sales is likely to provide further evidence that Britain's economic recovery remains on track despite the challenges posed by COVID-19.",

    "LONDON (BBC) - The soaring price of crude oil is having an increasingly devastating impact on global economic growth, according to experts.\nThe cost of Brent Crude has risen by more than 50% in just over a year and now stands at around $85 per barrel. This increase comes as countries struggle with inflationary pressures caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19.\nAnalysts warn that this surge could lead to higher fuel prices for consumers, which would further exacerbate already high levels of inflation across many economies. Additionally, rising energy costs are likely to hit industries such as transportation, manufacturing, and construction hard, potentially leading to job losses and reduced investment.\nWhile some governments have attempted to mitigate these effects through stimulus packages or subsidies, there are concerns about the long-term sustainability of such measures. Many economists believe that urgent action is needed to address the root causes of the crisis, including investing in renewable energies and improving energy efficiency.\nIn addition, geopolitical tensions between major producers like the US and China continue to escalate, raising fears of potential disruption to supplies. As a result, several international organizations have downgraded their forecasts for global GDP growth this year.\nOverall, analysts say that while short-term fluctuations in commodity markets are always possible, the current situation represents a significant challenge to the stability and prosperity of the global economy.",
    "Liverpool and England midfielder Michael Owen is expected to be named as captain of his country's football team in the near future, according to reports on Thursday. \n\nThe 23-year-old has been widely tipped to succeed Tony Adams as armband holder following the former Arsenal defender's shock resignation from international duty last month.\n  \nAlthough there have been no official announcements yet over who will fill the void left by Adams, sources close to manager Sven Goran Eriksson suggest that he already knows whom he wants to lead out the Three Lions during tomorrow night's friendly against Australia at Newcastle's St James' Park stadium.\n \n   Should those whispers prove accurate then it would bring an end to decades of debate among English soccer aficionados about which current player deserves such recognition - with many arguing either Manchester United striker Alan Shearer or Chelsea midfield general Dennis Wise should take up the mantle instead.",
    "Manchester United could face a potential sixth-round FA Cup clash with League Two side Stockport County after they were drawn together in the fifth round of the competition.\n\nThe National League side, who are currently 11th in the table, pulled off a shock by beating Championship side Rotherham United 2-1 at Edgeley Park on Saturday to book their place in the next round.\n\nIf United, who are currently second in the Premier League, were to beat Shrewsbury Town in their fifth-round tie later this month, they would face Stockport in a mouth-watering clash at Old Trafford.\n\nThe potential tie has been dubbed as the \"Bee-atles\" clash, with both teams having bee emblems in their crests.\n\nStockport manager Jim Gannon, who played for United in the 1990s, said: \"It would be a fantastic draw for us if we were to get Manchester United at home.\n\n\"We know it would be a tough game but we have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

    "In a move that could spark a bidding war, Qwest Communications International has made an offer to acquire MCI Inc, a rival telecommunications company. The offer, worth approximately $14.8 billion, was made public on Monday.\n\nIf the deal goes through, it would create the second-largest telecommunications company in the United States, behind only AT&T. Qwest's offer is higher than the $14 billion offer made by Verizon Communications earlier this year, which was rejected by MCI.\n\nMCI's board of directors has formed a special committee to review Qwest's offer and determine the best course of action for the company. It is unclear at this time whether Qwest's offer will be accepted or if other companies may enter the bidding war.\n\nThe telecommunications industry has been undergoing significant changes in recent years, with many companies seeking to consolidate in order to cut costs and remain competitive. This latest development could further shake up the industry and lead to more mergers and acquisitions in the future.",
    "The controversial hunting season has begun in England and Wales, with hunt supporters determined to push for their rights despite recent bans being lifted. The Hunting Act 2004 made it illegal to hunt wild mammals with dogs but exemptions were granted for foxes, which are considered vermin, and hares on certain conditions.\n\nHowever, animal welfare campaigners have expressed concerns over how these exceptions will be enforced, fearing that hunts may still cause distress to protected species such as deer or horses. They also argue that there is no scientific evidence proving that hunting helps control pest populations.\n\nIn response, pro-hunt groups claim they follow strict guidelines laid out by the governing bodies and insist that all participants undergo training before taking part in any activities. Supporters say this sport provides an important tradition within rural communities while others see it as cruel and unnecessary practice.\n\nAs hunters take to fields across country today, police forces have warned that anyone found flouting the law could face prosecution. It remains unclear whether enforcement officers would prioritize investigating complaints related to non-exempted animals like rabbits during ongoing debates surrounding legality and morality of traditional British pastime."
