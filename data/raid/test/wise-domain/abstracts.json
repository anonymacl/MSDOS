    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type.

To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection.

Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects.

    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions.

    "Many deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation involve a Fully\nConvolutional Neural Network (FCN) followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF)\nto carry out inference over an image.

We therefore suggest incorporating\ninto the inference algorithm additional higher-order potentials inspired by the\nway humans identify and localize parts. We incorporate two relations that were\nshown to be useful to human object identification - containment and attachment\n- into the energy term of the CRF and evaluate their performance on the Pascal\nVOC Parts dataset.

The model is trained jointly in a multi-task learning setting.\nIn this paper, we propose Mixed-Supervised Dual-Network (MSDN), a novel\narchitecture which consists of two separate networks for the detection and\nsegmentation tasks respectively, and a series of connection modules between the\nlayers of the two networks. These connection modules are used to transfer\nuseful information from the auxiliary detection task to help the segmentation\ntask.

    "  We introduce a high-level graphical framework for designing and analysing\nquantum error correcting codes, centred on what we term the coherent parity\ncheck (CPC).

We show how CSS codes form a subset of CPC codes and, more\ngenerally, how to compute stabilizers for a CPC code. As an explicit example of\nthis framework, we give a method for turning almost any pair of classical\n[n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code. Further, we give a simple\ntechnique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and\ndemonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally, we use the\ngraphical tools to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within\nCPC codes. As our framework gives a new tool for constructing small- to\nmedium-sized codes with relatively high code rates, it provides a new source\nfor codes that could be suitable for emerging devices, while its zx-calculus\nfoundations enable natural integration of error correction with graphical\ncompiler toolchains. It also provides a powerful framework for reasoning about\nall stabilizer quantum error correction codes of any size.\n",
    "Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional\nnetworks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling\nlayers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to\npredictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has\nattempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or\nMRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between\nobjects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these\nproblems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The\ndownside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than\ntraditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.\n  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk\nNetwork (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and\nspatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity.\nOur proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and\nsemantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk\nlayer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the\nnetwork. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix\nmultiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks\nand it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard\nback-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional\nparameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces\nan improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.",

So this can be understood as one\napplication of Floer theory and the theory of $\\infty$-categories in basic\ndifferential geometry. We also develop, based on this $\\infty$-categorical\nFukaya theory, some basic new integer valued invariants of smooth manifolds,\ncalled quantum obstruction. On the way we also construct what we call quantum\nMaslov classes, which are higher degree variants of the relative Seidel\nmorphism. This also leads to new applications in Hofer geometry of the space of\nLagrangian equators in $S^2$.\n",

    "Most progress in semantic segmentation reports on daytime images taken under\nfavorable illumination conditions. We instead address the problem of semantic\nsegmentation of nighttime images and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting\ndaytime models to nighttime without using nighttime annotations. Moreover, we\ndesign a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of\nsemantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum\nframework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night via\nlabeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively\ndarker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspondences for the\nreal images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel\nuncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic\nsegmentation, designed for adverse conditions and including image regions\nbeyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion;\n3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which comprises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920\nunlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts\nplus a set of 151 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created\nwith our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark to perform our novel\nevaluation. Experiments show that our guided curriculum adaptation\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real nighttime sets both\nfor standard metrics and our uncertainty-aware metric. Furthermore, our\nuncertainty-aware evaluation reveals that selective invalidation of predictions\ncan lead to better results on data with ambiguous content such as our nighttime\nbenchmark and profit safety-oriented applications which involve invalid inputs.",
    "  Granular materials do not flow homogeneously like fluids when submitted to\nexternal stress,but often form rigid regions that are separated by narrow shear\nbands where the material yields and flows. This shear localization impacts\ntheir apparent rheology, which makes it difficult to infer a constitutive\nbehaviour from conventional rheometric measurements. Moreover, they present a\ndilatant behaviour, which makes their study in classical fixedvolume geometries\ndifficult. These features led to perform extensive studies with inclined plane\nflows, which were of crucial importance for the development and the validation\nof the $\\mu(I)$ rheology. Our aim is to develop a method to characterize\ngranular materials with rheometrical tools. Using unusual rheometry\nmeasurements in an annular shear cell adapted from Boyer et al.

    "Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a\nnatural language expression.

To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective\nby decoupling it into a \"Locate-Then-Segment\" (LTS) scheme. Given a language\nexpression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding\ntarget image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object\nbased on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual\nfeatures to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model\ninteraction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with\nposition prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a\nlight-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly\neffective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+\nand +3.4% on RefCOCOg).

The method partitions a QLF image into segments of uniform texture and\nintensity called superpixels; every superpixel is statistically modeled as a\nrealization of a single 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) whose parameters\nare estimated; the superpixel is then assigned to one of three classes\n(background, biofilm, tooth substratum) based on the training set of data.

In this paper, a novel\napproach for clustering based image segmentation is proposed. Here, we give\nimportance on color space and choose lab for this task. The famous hard\nclustering algorithm K-means is used, but as its performance is dependent on\nchoosing a proper distance measure, so, we go for cosine distance measure. Then\nthe segmented image is filtered with sobel filter. The filtered image is\nanalyzed with marker watershed algorithm to have the final segmented result of\nour original image. The MSE and PSNR values are evaluated to observe the\nperformance.",
    "Class imbalance has emerged as one of the major challenges for medical image\nsegmentation. The model cascade (MC) strategy significantly alleviates the\nclass imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for\ncoarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this\nmethod leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation\namong the models. To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model,\ni.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better\nthan MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net\nintegrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists\nof shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific\nparameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively\noptimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design\nboth an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based\ntraining strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between\ntasks and design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can\nadaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the\ncategory-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing\nmethod is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most\nimpressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing\nset and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed approaches, we\nalso won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating\nteams. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/chenhong-zhou/OM-Net.",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks have driven substantial advancements in\nthe automatic understanding of images. Requiring a large collection of images\nand their associated annotations is one of the main bottlenecks limiting the\nadoption of deep networks. In the task of medical image segmentation, requiring\npixel-level semantic annotations performed by human experts exacerbate this\ndifficulty. This paper proposes a new framework to train a fully convolutional\nsegmentation network from a large set of cheap unreliable annotations and a\nsmall set of expert-level clean annotations. We propose a spatially adaptive\nreweighting approach to treat clean and noisy pixel-level annotations\ncommensurately in the loss function. We deploy a meta-learning approach to\nassign higher importance to pixels whose loss gradient direction is closer to\nthose of clean data. Our experiments on training the network using segmentation\nground truth corrupted with different levels of annotation noise show how\nspatial reweighting improves the robustness of deep networks to noisy\nannotations.",
    "Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely\napplied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively\nand be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a\ngood machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good\nmodel training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the\nperformance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the\nmachine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each\nprocedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training\ndata ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information\nfor the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each\nmodel or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model\ncapture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can\nprovide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible\nlocal optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in\nmachine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the\ndiversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically\nsummarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and\ninference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In\naddition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the\nmachine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing\nimaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation,\nobject detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some\nchallenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some\ndirections in future work.",
    "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a image into different\nregions or groups based on some characteristics like color, texture, motion or\nshape etc. Active contours is a popular variational method for object\nsegmentation in images, in which the user initializes a contour which evolves\nin order to optimize an objective function designed such that the desired\nobject boundary is the optimal solution. Recently, imaging modalities that\nproduce Manifold valued images have come up, for example, DT-MRI images, vector\nfields. The traditional active contour model does not work on such images. In\nthis paper, we generalize the active contour model to work on Manifold valued\nimages. As expected, our algorithm detects regions with similar Manifold values\nin the image. Our algorithm also produces expected results on usual gray-scale\nimages, since these are nothing but trivial examples of Manifold valued images.\nAs another application of our general active contour model, we perform texture\nsegmentation on gray-scale images by first creating an appropriate Manifold\nvalued image. We demonstrate segmentation results for manifold valued images\nand texture images.",
    "Brain extraction is a fundamental step for most brain imaging studies. In\nthis paper, we investigate the problem of skull stripping and propose\ncomplementary segmentation networks (CompNets) to accurately extract the brain\nfrom T1-weighted MRI scans, for both normal and pathological brain images. The\nproposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and\nhave two pathways to learn features from both the brain tissue and its\ncomplementary part located outside of the brain. The complementary pathway\nextracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to\nbrain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training\ndataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on\nthe OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the\ntwo-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is\nverified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its\ninvariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network\ndesign is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation\nproblems with better generalization.",
    "We introduce the concept of derivate-based component-trees for images with an\narbitrary number of channels. The approach is a natural extension of the\nclassical component-tree devoted to gray-scale images. The similar structure\nenables the translation of many gray-level image processing techniques based on\nthe component-tree to hyperspectral and color images. As an example\napplication, we present an image segmentation approach that extracts Maximally\nStable Homogeneous Regions (MSHR). The approach very similar to MSER but can be\napplied to images with an arbitrary number of channels. As opposed to MSER, our\napproach implicitly segments regions with are both lighter and darker than\ntheir background for gray-scale images and can be used in OCR applications\nwhere MSER will fail. We introduce a local flooding-based immersion for the\nderivate-based component-tree construction which is linear in the number of\npixels. In the experiments, we show that the runtime scales favorably with an\nincreasing number of channels and may improve algorithms which build on MSER.",
    "  A distributed adaptive algorithm is proposed to solve a node-specific\nparameter estimation problem where nodes are interested in estimating\nparameters of local interest, parameters of common interest to a subset of\nnodes and parameters of global interest to the whole network. To address the\ndifferent node-specific parameter estimation problems, this novel algorithm\nrelies on a diffusion-based implementation of different Least Mean Squares\n(LMS) algorithms, each associated with the estimation of a specific set of\nlocal, common or global parameters. Coupled with the estimation of the\ndifferent sets of parameters, the implementation of each LMS algorithm is only\nundertaken by the nodes of the network interested in a specific set of local,\ncommon or global parameters. The study of convergence in the mean sense reveals\nthat the proposed algorithm is asymptotically unbiased. Moreover, a\nspatial-temporal energy conservation relation is provided to evaluate the\nsteady-state performance at each node in the mean-square sense. Finally, the\ntheoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed technique are\nvalidated through computer simulations in the context of cooperative spectrum\nsensing in Cognitive Radio networks.\n",

    "  We characterize Leavitt path algebras which are Rickart, Baer, and Baer\n$*$-rings in terms of the properties of the underlying graph. In order to treat\nnon-unital Leavitt path algebras as well, we generalize these\nannihilator-related properties to locally unital rings and provide a more\ngeneral characterizations of Leavitt path algebras which are locally Rickart,\nlocally Baer, and locally Baer $*$-rings. Leavitt path algebras are also graded\nrings and we formulate the graded versions of these annihilator-related\nproperties and characterize Leavitt path algebras having those properties as\nwell.\n  Our characterizations provide a quick way to generate a wide variety of\nexamples of rings. For example, creating a Baer and not a Baer $*$-ring, a\nRickart $*$-ring which is not Baer, or a Baer and not a Rickart $*$-ring, is\nstraightforward using the graph-theoretic properties from our results. In\naddition, our characterizations showcase more properties which distinguish\nbehavior of Leavitt path algebras from their $C^*$-algebra counterparts. For\nexample, while a graph $C^*$-algebra is Baer (and a Baer $*$-ring) if and only\nif the underlying graph is finite and acyclic, a Leavitt path algebra is Baer\nif and only if the graph is finite and no cycle has an exit, and it is a Baer\n$*$-ring if and only if the graph is a finite disjoint union of graphs which\nare finite and acyclic or loops.\n",
    "We present Convolutional Oriented Boundaries (COB), which produces multiscale\noriented contours and region hierarchies starting from generic image\nclassification Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Particularly, we show that learning to estimate not only contour\nstrength but also orientation provides more accurate results. We perform\nextensive experiments for low-level applications on BSDS, PASCAL Context,\nPASCAL Segmentation, and NYUD to evaluate boundary detection performance,\nshowing that COB provides state-of-the-art contours and region hierarchies in\nall datasets. We also evaluate COB on high-level tasks when coupled with\nmultiple pipelines for object proposals, semantic contours, semantic\nsegmentation, and object detection on MS-COCO, SBD, and PASCAL; showing that\nCOB also improves the results for all tasks.",
    "Semi-supervised learning has recently been attracting attention as an\nalternative to fully supervised models that require large pools of labeled\ndata.

    "While making a tremendous impact in various fields, deep neural networks\nusually require large amounts of labeled data for training which are expensive\nto collect in many applications, especially in the medical domain. Unlabeled\ndata, on the other hand, is much more abundant. Semi-supervised learning\ntechniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage\nunlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware\nmulti-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data,\nsuch as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is\nachieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate\ndifferent views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical\n3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In\naddition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate\nthe reliability of each view's prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one\nview requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our\nself-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each\nunlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach\ncan take advantage of unlabeled data during training.

    "We introduce a novel Deep Learning framework, which quantitatively estimates\nimage segmentation quality without the need for human inspection or labeling.\nWe refer to this method as a Quality Assurance Network -- QANet. Specifically,\ngiven an image and a `proposed' corresponding segmentation, obtained by any\nmethod including manual annotation, the QANet solves a regression problem in\norder to estimate a predefined quality measure with respect to the unknown\nground truth. The QANet is by no means yet another segmentation method.\nInstead, it performs a multi-level, multi-feature comparison of an\nimage-segmentation pair based on a unique network architecture, called the\nRibCage.\n  To demonstrate the strength of the QANet, we addressed the evaluation of\ninstance segmentation using two different datasets from different domains,\nnamely, high throughput live cell microscopy images from the Cell Segmentation\nBenchmark and natural images of plants from the Leaf Segmentation Challenge.\nWhile synthesized segmentations were used to train the QANet, it was tested on\nsegmentations obtained by publicly available methods that participated in the\ndifferent challenges.

    "Person re-identification is becoming a hot research for developing both\nmachine learning algorithms and video surveillance applications. The task of\nperson re-identification is to determine which person in a gallery has the same\nidentity to a probe image. This task basically assumes that the subject of the\nprobe image belongs to the gallery, that is, the gallery contains this person.\nHowever, in practical applications such as searching a suspect in a video, this\nassumption is usually not true. In this paper, we consider the open-set person\nre-identification problem, which includes two sub-tasks, detection and\nidentification. The detection sub-task is to determine the presence of the\nprobe subject in the gallery, and the identification sub-task is to determine\nwhich person in the gallery has the same identity as the accepted probe. We\npresent a database collected from a video surveillance setting of 6 cameras,\nwith 200 persons and 7,413 images segmented. Based on this database, we develop\na benchmark protocol for evaluating the performance under the open-set person\nre-identification scenario. Several popular metric learning algorithms for\nperson re-identification have been evaluated as baselines. From the baseline\nperformance, we observe that the open-set person re-identification problem is\nstill largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed.",
    "Mining and learning the shape variability of underlying population has\nbenefited the applications including parametric shape modeling, 3D animation,\nand image segmentation.

This paper\nformulates the pose learning problem as mixtures of factor analyzers. The\nsegmentation is obtained by components posterior probabilities and the\nrotations in pose variations are learned by the factor loading matrices. To\nguarantee that the factor loading matrices are composed by rotation matrices,\nconstraints are imposed and the corresponding closed form optimal solution is\nderived.

    "  Timed systems, such as timed automata, are usually analyzed using their\noperational semantics on timed words.

The main idea is to consider timed behaviors as graphs\nwith matching edges capturing timing constraints. When a family of graphs has\nbounded tree-width, they can be interpreted in trees and MSO-definable\nproperties of such graphs can be checked using tree automata. The technique is\nquite general and applies to many timed systems. In this paper, as an example,\nwe develop the technique on timed pushdown systems, which have recently\nreceived considerable attention. Further, we also demonstrate how we can use it\non timed automata and timed multi-stack pushdown systems (with boundedness\nrestrictions).\n",

A weakness of this approach is that different drivers\npossess vastly different densities at which traffic flow stagnates. This\ndrawback can be overcome by modifying the pressure relation in the ARZ model,\nleading to the generalized Aw-Rascle-Zhang (GARZ) model.

The novelty of this model is that the\nUniverse includes both cases curvature and torsion, and one dominated by a\nChaplygin gas. In order to calculate cosmological solutions, we obtained\nFriedmann equations and also equation of state (EoS) parameter of dark energy.\nBy employing interacting model we considered the total energy density and the\ntotal pressure of Universe as the combination of components of dark energy and\nChaplygin gas.

    "Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) techniques based on Super Resolution\nConvolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN) are applied to micro-computed tomography\n({\\mu}CT) images of sandstone and carbonate rocks. Digital rock imaging is\nlimited by the capability of the scanning device resulting in trade-offs\nbetween resolution and field of view, and super resolution methods tested in\nthis study aim to compensate for these limits. SRCNN models SR-Resnet, Enhanced\nDeep SR (EDSR), and Wide-Activation Deep SR (WDSR) are used on the Digital Rock\nSuper Resolution 1 (DRSRD1) Dataset of 4x downsampled images, comprising of\n2000 high resolution (800x800) raw micro-CT images of Bentheimer sandstone and\nEstaillades carbonate. The trained models are applied to the validation and\ntest data within the dataset and show a 3-5 dB rise in image quality compared\nto bicubic interpolation, with all tested models performing within a 0.1 dB\nrange. Difference maps indicate that edge sharpness is completely recovered in\nimages within the scope of the trained model, with only high frequency noise\nrelated detail loss. We find that aside from generation of high-resolution\nimages, a beneficial side effect of super resolution methods applied to\nsynthetically downgraded images is the removal of image noise while recovering\nedgewise sharpness which is beneficial for the segmentation process. The model\nis also tested against real low-resolution images of Bentheimer rock with image\naugmentation to account for natural noise and blur. The SRCNN method is shown\nto act as a preconditioner for image segmentation under these circumstances\nwhich naturally leads to further future development and training of models that\nsegment an image directly.

    "The development of high quality medical image segmentation algorithms depends\non the availability of large datasets with pixel-level labels. The challenges\nof collecting such datasets, especially in case of 3D volumes, motivate to\ndevelop approaches that can learn from other types of labels that are cheap to\nobtain, e.g. bounding boxes. We focus on 3D medical images with their\ncorresponding 3D bounding boxes which are considered as series of per-slice\nnon-tight 2D bounding boxes. While current weakly-supervised approaches that\nuse 2D bounding boxes as weak labels can be applied to medical image\nsegmentation, we show that their success is limited in cases when the\nassumption about the tightness of the bounding boxes breaks. We propose a new\nbounding box correction framework which is trained on a small set of\npixel-level annotations to improve the tightness of a larger set of non-tight\nbounding box annotations. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated by\nevaluating a known weakly-supervised segmentation approach with and without the\nproposed bounding box correction algorithm. When the tightness is improved by\nour solution, the results of the weakly-supervised segmentation become much\ncloser to those of the fully-supervised one.",
    "This paper presents a novel unsupervised segmentation method for 3D medical\nimages. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have brought significant advances\nin image segmentation. However, most of the recent methods rely on supervised\nlearning, which requires large amounts of manually annotated data. Thus, it is\nchallenging for these methods to cope with the growing amount of medical\nimages. This paper proposes a unified approach to unsupervised deep\nrepresentation learning and clustering for segmentation. Our proposed method\nconsists of two phases. In the first phase, we learn deep feature\nrepresentations of training patches from a target image using joint\nunsupervised learning (JULE) that alternately clusters representations\ngenerated by a CNN and updates the CNN parameters using cluster labels as\nsupervisory signals. We extend JULE to 3D medical images by utilizing 3D\nconvolutions throughout the CNN architecture. In the second phase, we apply\nk-means to the deep representations from the trained CNN and then project\ncluster labels to the target image in order to obtain the fully segmented\nimage. We evaluated our methods on three images of lung cancer specimens\nscanned with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The automatic segmentation\nof pathological regions in micro-CT could further contribute to the\npathological examination process.

    "  We study the impact of electrode band structure on transport through\nsingle-molecule junctions by measuring the conductance of pyridine-based\nmolecules using Ag and Au electrodes. Our experiments are carried out using the\nscanning tunneling microscope based break-junction technique and are supported\nby density functional theory based calculations. We find from both experiments\nand calculations that the coupling of the dominant transport orbital to the\nmetal is stronger for Au-based junctions when compared with Ag-based junctions.\nWe attribute this difference to relativistic effects, which results in an\nenhanced density of d-states at the Fermi energy for Au compared with Ag. We\nfurther show that the alignment of the conducting orbital relative to the Fermi\nlevel does not follow the work function difference between two metals and is\ndifferent for conjugated and saturated systems. We thus demonstrate that the\ndetails of the molecular level alignment and electronic coupling in\nmetal-organic interfaces do not follow simple rules, but are rather the\nconsequence of subtle local interactions.\n",
    "  Many practical sensing applications involve multiple sensors simultaneously\nacquiring measurements of a single object. Conversely, most existing sparse\nrecovery guarantees in compressed sensing concern only single-sensor\nacquisition scenarios. In this paper, we address the optimal recovery of\ncompressible signals from multi-sensor measurements using compressed sensing\ntechniques, thereby confirming the benefits of multi- over single-sensor\nenvironments. Throughout the paper, we consider a broad class of sensing\nmatrices, and two fundamentally different sampling scenarios (distinct and\nidentical respectively), both of which are relevant to applications. For the\ncase of diagonal sensor profile matrices (which characterize environmental\nconditions between a source and the sensors), this paper presents two key\nimprovements over existing results. First, a simpler optimal recovery guarantee\nfor distinct sampling, and second, an improved recovery guarantee for identical\nsampling, based on the so-called sparsity in levels signal model.\n",
    "This paper proposes the first, known to us, open source presentation attack\ndetection (PAD) solution to distinguish between authentic iris images (possibly\nwearing clear contact lenses) and irises with textured contact lenses.

The\nsoftware is written in C++ and Python and uses only open source resources, such\nas OpenCV. This method does not incorporate iris image segmentation, which may\nbe problematic for unknown fake samples. Instead, it makes a best guess to\nlocalize the rough position of the iris.

    "  Analyzing the exchange energy of two conduction electrons in a crystal we\nfind that the exchange energy may be negative and, thus, a singlet state may be\nfavorable. A full overlap in real space of wave functions of two conduction\nelectrons leads to a deeper exchange energy. Thus, the exchange interaction\ncauses a bond between two conduction electrons in real space. The singlet bond\nis possible because the singlet electrons can simultaneously and permanently\noccupy one spatial ground state, so the average energy of paired electrons is\nlower than the energy of unpaired electrons. Thus, the pairing is a result of\nthe Pauli Exclusion Principle. If conduction electrons, before pairing, are put\non the Fermi surface in the momentum space, then every pair may exist\npermanently in time. The motion of conduction electrons in the crystal may\nprevent the formation of Cooper pairs, because the kinetic energy of the motion\nis usually larger than the binding energy in the pair. Conduction electrons as\nstanding waves are local and have zero momenta, hence their momenta are\nsynchronous; therefore, weak singlet bonds are stable despite the large kinetic\nenergy on the Fermi surface. The local pairing of standing waves explains the\ninverse isotope effect, Tc-dome, insulator-superconductor transitions and many\nother facts about superconductors. The electron pairs, as bosons, can form a\nmacroscopically coherent Bose-Einstein-Condensate and, thus, become\nnon-dissipative and non-local.\n",

    "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become increasingly important due to their\nexcellent empirical performance on a wide range of problems. However,\nregularization is generally achieved by indirect means, largely due to the\ncomplex set of functions defined by a network and the difficulty in measuring\nfunction complexity. There exists no method in the literature for additive\nregularization based on a norm of the function, as is classically considered in\nstatistical learning theory. In this work, we propose sampling-based\napproximations to weighted function norms as regularizers for deep neural\nnetworks. We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first proof in the\nliterature of the NP-hardness of computing function norms of DNNs, motivating\nthe necessity of an approximate approach. We then derive a generalization bound\nfor functions trained with weighted norms and prove that a natural stochastic\noptimization strategy minimizes the bound. Finally, we empirically validate the\nimproved performance of the proposed regularization strategies for both convex\nfunction sets as well as DNNs on real-world classification and image\nsegmentation tasks demonstrating improved performance over weight decay,\ndropout, and batch normalization.

    "  We propose and demonstrate localized mode coupling as a viable dispersion\nengineering technique for phase-matched resonant four-wave mixing (FWM). We\ndemonstrate a dual-cavity resonant structure that employs coupling-induced\nfrequency splitting at one of three resonances to compensate for cavity\ndispersion, enabling phase-matching. Coupling strength is controlled by thermal\ntuning of one cavity enabling active control of the resonant\nfrequency-matching. In a fabricated silicon microresonator, we show an 8 dB\nenhancement of seeded FWM efficiency over the non-compensated state. The\nmeasured four-wave mixing has a peak wavelength conversion efficiency of -37.9\ndB across a free spectral range (FSR) of 3.334 THz ($\\sim$27 nm). Enabled by\nstrong counteraction of dispersion, this FSR is, to our knowledge, the largest\nin silicon to demonstrate FWM to date. This form of mode-coupling-based, active\ndispersion compensation can be beneficial for many FWM-based devices including\nwavelength converters, parametric amplifiers, and widely detuned correlated\nphoton-pair sources. Apart from compensating intrinsic dispersion, the proposed\nmechanism can alternatively be utilized in an otherwise dispersionless\nresonator to counteract the detuning effect of self- and cross-phase modulation\non the pump resonance during FWM, thereby addressing a fundamental issue in the\nperformance of light sources such as broadband optical frequency combs.\n",

    "The random walker (RW) algorithm is used for both image segmentation and\nregistration, and possesses several useful properties that make it popular in\nmedical imaging, such as being globally optimizable, allowing user interaction,\nand providing uncertainty information. The RW algorithm defines a weighted\ngraph over an image and uses the graph's Laplacian matrix to regularize its\nsolutions. This regularization reduces to solving a large system of equations,\nwhich may be excessively time consuming in some applications, such as when\ninteracting with a human user. Techniques have been developed that precompute\neigenvectors of a Laplacian offline, after image acquisition but before any\nanalysis, in order speed up the RW algorithm online, when segmentation or\nregistration is being performed. However, precomputation requires certain\nalgorithm parameters be fixed offline, limiting their flexibility. In this\npaper, we develop techniques to update the precomputed data online when RW\nparameters are altered. Specifically, we dynamically determine the number of\neigenvectors needed for a desired accuracy based on user input, and derive\nupdate equations for the eigenvectors when the edge weights or topology of the\nimage graph are changed.

    "The main obstacle to weakly supervised semantic image segmentation is the\ndifficulty of obtaining pixel-level information from coarse image-level\nannotations.

    "Uncertainty estimation is important for interpreting the trustworthiness of\nmachine learning models in many applications. This is especially critical in\nthe data-driven active learning setting where the goal is to achieve a certain\naccuracy with minimum labeling effort. In such settings, the model learns to\nselect the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation based on its\nestimated uncertainty. The highly uncertain predictions are assumed to be more\ninformative for improving model performance. In this paper, we explore\nuncertainty calibration within an active learning framework for medical image\nsegmentation, an area where labels often are scarce. Various uncertainty\nestimation methods and acquisition strategies (regions and full images) are\ninvestigated. We observe that selecting regions to annotate instead of full\nimages leads to more well-calibrated models. Additionally, we experimentally\nshow that annotating regions can cut 50% of pixels that need to be labeled by\nhumans compared to annotating full images.",
    "  This paper presents a new Bayesian collaborative sparse regression method for\nlinear unmixing of hyperspectral images. Our contribution is twofold; first, we\npropose a new Bayesian model for structured sparse regression in which the\nsupports of the sparse abundance vectors are a priori spatially correlated\nacross pixels (i.e., materials are spatially organised rather than randomly\ndistributed at a pixel level). This prior information is encoded in the model\nthrough a truncated multivariate Ising Markov random field, which also takes\ninto consideration the facts that pixels cannot be empty (i.e, there is at\nleast one material present in each pixel), and that different materials may\nexhibit different degrees of spatial regularity. Secondly, we propose an\nadvanced Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the posterior\nprobabilities that materials are present or absent in each pixel, and,\nconditionally to the maximum marginal a posteriori configuration of the\nsupport, compute the MMSE estimates of the abundance vectors. A remarkable\nproperty of this algorithm is that it self-adjusts the values of the parameters\nof the Markov random field, thus relieving practitioners from setting\nregularisation parameters by cross-validation. The performance of the proposed\nmethodology is finally demonstrated through a series of experiments with\nsynthetic and real data and comparisons with other algorithms from the\nliterature.\n",
    "Superpixel segmentation has become an important research problem in image\nprocessing. In this paper, we propose an Iterative Spanning Forest (ISF)\nframework, based on sequences of Image Foresting Transforms, where one can\nchoose i) a seed sampling strategy, ii) a connectivity function, iii) an\nadjacency relation, and iv) a seed pixel recomputation procedure to generate\nimproved sets of connected superpixels (supervoxels in 3D) per iteration. The\nsuperpixels in ISF structurally correspond to spanning trees rooted at those\nseeds. We present five ISF methods to illustrate different choices of its\ncomponents. These methods are compared with approaches from the\nstate-of-the-art in effectiveness and efficiency. The experiments involve 2D\nand 3D datasets with distinct characteristics, and a high level application,\nnamed sky image segmentation.

    "It is important to find the target as soon as possible for search and rescue\noperations. Surveillance camera systems and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are\nused to support search and rescue. Automatic object detection is important\nbecause a person cannot monitor multiple surveillance screens simultaneously\nfor 24 hours. Also, the object is often too small to be recognized by the human\neye on the surveillance screen. This study used UAVs around the Port of Houston\nand fixed surveillance cameras to build an automatic target detection system\nthat supports the US Coast Guard (USCG) to help find targets (e.g., person\noverboard). We combined image segmentation, enhancement, and convolution neural\nnetworks to reduce detection time to detect small targets.

The wind flow is modeled by a\nmulti-mesh (cut finite element) method. This allows each building to be\nembedded in a boundary-fitted mesh which can be moved freely on top of a fixed\nbackground mesh. This approach enables a multitude of settlement layouts to be\nevaluated without the need for costly mesh generation when changing the\nconfiguration of buildings.

    "In photography, low depth of field (DOF) is an important technique to\nemphasize the object of interest (OOI) within an image. Thus, low DOF images\nare widely used in the application area of macro, portrait or sports\nphotography. When viewing a low DOF image, the viewer implicitly concentrates\non the regions that are sharper regions of the image and thus segments the\nimage into regions of interest and non regions of interest which has a major\nimpact on the perception of the image. Thus, a robust algorithm for the fully\nautomatic detection of the OOI in low DOF images provides valuable information\nfor subsequent image processing and image retrieval.

    "  We consider the Longest Queue Drop memory management policy in shared-memory\nswitches consisting of $N$ output ports. The shared memory of size $M\\geq N$\nmay have an arbitrary number of input ports. Each packet may be admitted by any\nincoming port, but must be destined to a specific output port and each output\nport may be used by only one queue. The Longest Queue Drop policy is a natural\nonline strategy used in directing the packet flow in buffering problems.\nAccording to this policy and assuming unit packet values and cost of\ntransmission, every incoming packet is accepted, whereas if the shared memory\nbecomes full, one or more packets belonging to the longest queue are preempted,\nin order to make space for the newly arrived packets. It was proved in 2001\n[Hahne et al., SPAA '01] that the Longest Queue Drop policy is 2-competitive\nand at least $\\sqrt{2}$-competitive.

    "We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network\narchitecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core\ntrainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding\ndecoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture\nof the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional\nlayers in the VGG16 network. The role of the decoder network is to map the low\nresolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for\npixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which\nthe decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically,\nthe decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the\ncorresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the\nneed for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then\nconvolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our\nproposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN and also with the well known\nDeepLab-LargeFOV, DeconvNet architectures. This comparison reveals the memory\nversus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance.\n  SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it\nis designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time\nduring inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable\nparameters than other competing architectures.

    "Methods that move towards less supervised scenarios are key for image\nsegmentation, as dense labels demand significant human intervention.

Egg images are segmented\nusing the K-means algorithm based on Lab color images. The results of the\nimages acquisition are converted into Lab color space images. The results of\nLab color space images are processed using K-means for each color. The K-means\nprocess uses cluster k=3, where this cluster divided the image into three\nparts, namely background, eggs, and yolk eggs. Yolk eggs are part of eggs that\nhave embryonic characteristics. This study applies the concept of color in the\ninitial segmentation and grayscale in the final stages.

    "Image segmentation is a fundamental research topic in image processing and\ncomputer vision. In the last decades, researchers developed a large number of\nsegmentation algorithms for various applications. Amongst these algorithms, the\nNormalized cut (Ncut) segmentation method is widely applied due to its good\nperformance. The Ncut segmentation model is an optimization problem whose\nenergy is defined on a specifically designed graph. Thus, the segmentation\nresults of the existing Ncut method are largely dependent on a pre-constructed\nsimilarity measure on the graph since this measure is usually given empirically\nby users. This flaw will lead to some undesirable segmentation results. In this\npaper, we propose a Ncut-based segmentation algorithm by integrating an\nadaptive similarity measure and spatial regularization. The proposed model\ncombines the Parzen-Rosenblatt window method, non-local weights entropy, Ncut\nenergy, and regularizer of phase field in a variational framework. Our method\ncan adaptively update the similarity measure function by estimating some\nparameters. This adaptive procedure enables the proposed algorithm finding a\nbetter similarity measure for classification than the Ncut method. We provide\nsome mathematical interpretation of the proposed adaptive similarity from\nmulti-viewpoints such as statistics and convex optimization. In addition, the\nregularizer of phase field can guarantee that the proposed algorithm has a\nrobust performance in the presence of noise, and it can also rectify the\nsimilarity measure with a spatial priori. The well-posed theory such as the\nexistence of the minimizer for the proposed model is given in the paper.\nCompared with some existing segmentation methods such as the traditional\nNcut-based model and the classical Chan-Vese model, the numerical experiments\nshow that our method can provide promising segmentation results.",
    "  Text data is often seen as \"take-away\" materials with little noise and easy\nto process information. Main questions are how to get data and transform them\ninto a good document format. But data can be sensitive to noise oftenly called\nambiguities. Ambiguities are aware from a long time, mainly because polysemy is\nobvious in language and context is required to remove uncertainty. I claim in\nthis paper that syntactic context is not suffisant to improve interpretation.\nIn this paper I try to explain that firstly noise can come from natural data\nthemselves, even involving high technology, secondly texts, seen as verified\nbut meaningless, can spoil content of a corpus; it may lead to contradictions\nand background noise.\n",
    "The task of image segmentation is inherently noisy due to ambiguities\nregarding the exact location of boundaries between anatomical structures. We\nargue that this information can be extracted from the expert annotations at no\nextra cost, and when integrated into state-of-the-art neural networks, it can\nlead to improved calibration between soft probabilistic predictions and the\nunderlying uncertainty. We built upon label smoothing (LS) where a network is\ntrained on 'blurred' versions of the ground truth labels which has been shown\nto be effective for calibrating output predictions. However, LS is not taking\nthe local structure into account and results in overly smoothed predictions\nwith low confidence even for non-ambiguous regions. Here, we propose Spatially\nVarying Label Smoothing (SVLS), a soft labeling technique that captures the\nstructural uncertainty in semantic segmentation. SVLS also naturally lends\nitself to incorporate inter-rater uncertainty when multiple labelmaps are\navailable. The proposed approach is extensively validated on four clinical\nsegmentation tasks with different imaging modalities, number of classes and\nsingle and multi-rater expert annotations. The results demonstrate that SVLS,\ndespite its simplicity, obtains superior boundary prediction with improved\nuncertainty and model calibration.",
    "Medical image segmentation is inherently an ambiguous task due to factors\nsuch as partial volumes and variations in anatomical definitions. While in most\ncases the segmentation uncertainty is around the border of structures of\ninterest, there can also be considerable inter-rater differences. The class of\nconditional variational autoencoders (cVAE) offers a principled approach to\ninferring distributions over plausible segmentations that are conditioned on\ninput images. Segmentation uncertainty estimated from samples of such\ndistributions can be more informative than using pixel level probability\nscores. In this work, we propose a novel conditional generative model that is\nbased on conditional Normalizing Flow (cFlow). The basic idea is to increase\nthe expressivity of the cVAE by introducing a cFlow transformation step after\nthe encoder. This yields improved approximations of the latent posterior\ndistribution, allowing the model to capture richer segmentation variations.\nWith this we show that the quality and diversity of samples obtained from our\nconditional generative model is enhanced. Performance of our model, which we\ncall cFlow Net, is evaluated on two medical imaging datasets demonstrating\nsubstantial improvements in both qualitative and quantitative measures when\ncompared to a recent cVAE based model.",
    "Currently, developments of deep learning techniques are providing\ninstrumental to identify, classify, and quantify patterns in medical images.\nSegmentation is one of the important applications in medical image analysis. In\nthis regard, U-Net is the predominant approach to medical image segmentation\ntasks. However, we found that those U-Net based models have limitations in\nseveral aspects, for example, millions of parameters in the U-Net consuming\nconsiderable computation resource and memory, lack of global information, and\nmissing some tough objects. Therefore, we applied two modifications to improve\nthe U-Net model: 1) designed and added the dilated channel-wise CNN module, 2)\nsimplified the U shape network. Based on these two modifications, we proposed a\nnovel light-weight architecture -- Channel-wise Feature Pyramid Network for\nMedicine (CFPNet-M). To evaluate our method, we selected five datasets with\ndifferent modalities: thermography, electron microscopy, endoscopy, dermoscopy,\nand digital retinal images. And we compared its performance with several models\nhaving different parameter scales. This paper also involves our previous\nstudies of DC-UNet and some commonly used light-weight neural networks. We\napplied the Tanimoto similarity instead of the Jaccard index for gray-level\nimage measurements. By comparison, CFPNet-M achieves comparable segmentation\nresults on all five medical datasets with only 0.65 million parameters, which\nis about 2% of U-Net, and 8.8 MB memory.

    "  In the current hyper-connected era, modern Information and Communication\nTechnology systems form sophisticated networks where not only do people\ninteract with other people, but also machines take an increasingly visible and\nparticipatory role. Such human-machine networks (HMNs) are embedded in the\ndaily lives of people, both for personal and professional use. They can have a\nsignificant impact by producing synergy and innovations. The challenge in\ndesigning successful HMNs is that they cannot be developed and implemented in\nthe same manner as networks of machines nodes alone, nor following a wholly\nhuman-centric view of the network. The problem requires an interdisciplinary\napproach. Here, we review current research of relevance to HMNs across many\ndisciplines. Extending the previous theoretical concepts of socio-technical\nsystems, actor-network theory, cyber-physical-social systems, and social\nmachines, we concentrate on the interactions among humans and between humans\nand machines. We identify eight types of HMNs: public-resource computing,\ncrowdsourcing, web search engines, crowdsensing, online markets, social media,\nmultiplayer online games and virtual worlds, and mass collaboration. We\nsystematically select literature on each of these types and review it with a\nfocus on implications for designing HMNs.

    "  In a k-linear triangulated category (where k is a field) we show that the\nexistence of Auslander-Reiten triangles implies that objects are determined, up\nto shift, by knowing dimensions of homomorphisms between them. In most cases\nthe objects themselves are distinguished by this information, a conclusion\nwhich was also reached under slightly different hypotheses in a theorem of\nJensen, Su and Zimmermann. The approach is to consider bilinear forms on\nGrothendieck groups which are analogous to the Green ring of a finite group.\n  We specialize to the category of perfect complexes for a self-injective\nalgebra, for which the Auslander-Reiten quiver has a known shape. We\ncharacterize the position in the quiver of many kinds of perfect complexes,\nincluding those of lengths 1, 2 and 3, rigid complexes and truncated projective\nresolutions. We describe completely the quiver components which contain\nprojective modules. We obtain relationships between the homology of complexes\nat different places in the quiver, deducing that every self-injective algebra\nof radical length at least 3 has indecomposable perfect complexes with\narbitrarily large homology in any given degree. We find also that homology\nstabilizes away from the rim of the quiver. We show that when the algebra is\nsymmetric, one of the forms considered earlier is Hermitian, and this allows us\nto compute its values knowing them only on objects on the rim of the quiver.\n",

    "Recent advances in deep learning based image segmentation methods have\nenabled real-time performance with human-level accuracy. However, occasionally\neven the best method fails due to low image quality, artifacts or unexpected\nbehaviour of black box algorithms. Being able to predict segmentation quality\nin the absence of ground truth is of paramount importance in clinical practice,\nbut also in large-scale studies to avoid the inclusion of invalid data in\nsubsequent analysis.\n  In this work, we propose two approaches of real-time automated quality\ncontrol for cardiovascular MR segmentations using deep learning.

    "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have had unprecedented success in medical\nimaging and, in particular, in medical image segmentation. However, despite the\nfact that segmentation results are closer than ever to the inter-expert\nvariability, CNNs are not immune to producing anatomically inaccurate\nsegmentations, even when built upon a shape prior. In this paper, we present a\nframework for producing cardiac image segmentation maps that are guaranteed to\nrespect pre-defined anatomical criteria, while remaining within the\ninter-expert variability. The idea behind our method is to use a well-trained\nCNN, have it process cardiac images, identify the anatomically implausible\nresults and warp these results toward the closest anatomically valid cardiac\nshape. This warping procedure is carried out with a constrained variational\nautoencoder (cVAE) trained to learn a representation of valid cardiac shapes\nthrough a smooth, yet constrained, latent space. With this cVAE, we can project\nany implausible shape into the cardiac latent space and steer it toward the\nclosest correct shape. We tested our framework on short-axis MRI as well as\napical two and four-chamber view ultrasound images, two modalities for which\ncardiac shapes are drastically different.

    "Compared to the general semantic segmentation problem, portrait segmentation\nhas higher precision requirement on boundary area. However, this problem has\nnot been well studied in previous works. In this paper, we propose a\nboundary-sensitive deep neural network (BSN) for portrait segmentation. BSN\nintroduces three novel techniques. First, an individual boundary-sensitive\nkernel is proposed by dilating the contour line and assigning the boundary\npixels with multi-class labels. Second, a global boundary-sensitive kernel is\nemployed as a position sensitive prior to further constrain the overall shape\nof the segmentation map. Third, we train a boundary-sensitive attribute\nclassifier jointly with the segmentation network to reinforce the network with\nsemantic boundary shape information. We have evaluated BSN on the current\nlargest public portrait segmentation dataset, i.e, the PFCN dataset, as well as\nthe portrait images collected from other three popular image segmentation\ndatasets: COCO, COCO-Stuff, and PASCAL VOC. Our method achieves the superior\nquantitative and qualitative performance over state-of-the-arts on all the\ndatasets, especially on the boundary area.",
    "In this paper, we demonstrate the ability to discriminate between cultivated\nmaize plant and grass or grass-like weed image segments using the context\nsurrounding the image segments. While convolutional neural networks have\nbrought state of the art accuracies within object detection, errors arise when\nobjects in different classes share similar features. This scenario often occurs\nwhen objects in images are viewed at too small of a scale to discern distinct\ndifferences in features, causing images to be incorrectly classified or\nlocalized. To solve this problem, we will explore using context when\nclassifying image segments. This technique involves feeding a convolutional\nneural network a central square image along with a border of its direct\nsurroundings at train and test times. This means that although images are\nlabelled at a smaller scale to preserve accurate localization, the network\nclassifies the images and learns features that include the wider context. We\ndemonstrate the benefits of this context technique in the object detection task\nthrough a case study of grass (foxtail) and grass-like (yellow nutsedge) weed\ndetection in maize fields. In this standard situation, adding context alone\nnearly halved the error of the neural network from 7.1% to 4.3%. After only one\nepoch with context, the network also achieved a higher accuracy than the\nnetwork without context did after 50 epochs. The benefits of using the context\ntechnique are likely to particularly evident in agricultural contexts in which\nparts (such as leaves) of several plants may appear similar when not taking\ninto account the context in which those parts appear.",
    "  An information theoretic approach to bounds in superconformal field theories\nis proposed.

    "In the recent years, convolutional neural networks have transformed the field\nof medical image analysis due to their capacity to learn discriminative image\nfeatures for a variety of classification and regression tasks. However,\nsuccessfully learning these features requires a large amount of manually\nannotated data, which is expensive to acquire and limited by the available\nresources of expert image analysts. Therefore, unsupervised, weakly-supervised\nand self-supervised feature learning techniques receive a lot of attention,\nwhich aim to utilise the vast amount of available data, while at the same time\navoid or substantially reduce the effort of manual annotation. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel way for training a cardiac MR image segmentation network, in\nwhich features are learnt in a self-supervised manner by predicting anatomical\npositions.

We demonstrate that this seemingly simple task\nprovides a strong signal for feature learning and with self-supervised\nlearning, we achieve a high segmentation accuracy that is better than or\ncomparable to a U-net trained from scratch, especially at a small data setting.\nWhen only five annotated subjects are available, the proposed method improves\nthe mean Dice metric from 0.811 to 0.852 for short-axis image segmentation,\ncompared to the baseline U-net.",
    "Medical image segmentation plays an essential role in developing\ncomputer-assisted diagnosis and therapy systems, yet still faces many\nchallenges. In the past few years, the popular encoder-decoder architectures\nbased on CNNs (e.g., U-Net) have been successfully applied in the task of\nmedical image segmentation. However, due to the locality of convolution\noperations, they demonstrate limitations in learning global context and\nlong-range spatial relations. Recently, several researchers try to introduce\ntransformers to both the encoder and decoder components with promising results,\nbut the efficiency requires further improvement due to the high computational\ncomplexity of transformers. In this paper, we propose LeViT-UNet, which\nintegrates a LeViT Transformer module into the U-Net architecture, for fast and\naccurate medical image segmentation. Specifically, we use LeViT as the encoder\nof the LeViT-UNet, which better trades off the accuracy and efficiency of the\nTransformer block. Moreover, multi-scale feature maps from transformer blocks\nand convolutional blocks of LeViT are passed into the decoder via\nskip-connection, which can effectively reuse the spatial information of the\nfeature maps.

    "We propose adversarial constrained-CNN loss, a new paradigm of\nconstrained-CNN loss methods, for weakly supervised medical image segmentation.\nIn the new paradigm, prior knowledge is encoded and depicted by reference\nmasks, and is further employed to impose constraints on segmentation outputs\nthrough adversarial learning with reference masks. Unlike pseudo label methods\nfor weakly supervised segmentation, such reference masks are used to train a\ndiscriminator rather than a segmentation network, and thus are not required to\nbe paired with specific images. Our new paradigm not only greatly facilitates\nimposing prior knowledge on network's outputs, but also provides stronger and\nhigher-order constraints, i.e., distribution approximation, through adversarial\nlearning. Extensive experiments involving different medical modalities,\ndifferent anatomical structures, different topologies of the object of\ninterest, different levels of prior knowledge and weakly supervised annotations\nwith different annotation ratios is conducted to evaluate our ACCL method.\nConsistently superior segmentation results over the size constrained-CNN loss\nmethod have been achieved, some of which are close to the results of full\nsupervision, thus fully verifying the effectiveness and generalization of our\nmethod.

    "Automatic parsing of anatomical objects in X-ray images is critical to many\nclinical applications in particular towards image-guided invention and workflow\nautomation.

The\nTD-GAN framework is general and can be easily adapted to other learning tasks.\nIn the numerical experiments, we validate the proposed model on 815 DRRs and\n153 topograms.

We disprove this conjecture by showing that the\ncolors of singular points of the cycle may affect the dimensions. However, the\ncolors of smooth points are irrelevant. By using bistellar moves we show that\nthe number of different dimension vectors arising on a given 3-dimensional\npseudomanifold with isolated singularities is a topological invariant.

    "In Computer Vision, edge detection is one of the favored approaches for\nfeature and object detection in images since it provides information about\ntheir objects boundaries. Other region-based approaches use probabilistic\nanalysis such as clustering and Markov random fields, but those methods cannot\nbe used to analyze edges and their interaction. In fact, only image\nsegmentation can produce regions based on edges, but it requires thresholding\nby simply separating the regions into binary in-out information. Hence, there\nis currently a gap between edge-based and region-based algorithms, since edges\ncannot be used to study the properties of a region and vice versa. The\nobjective of this paper is to present a novel spatial probability analysis that\nallows determining the probability of inclusion inside a set of partial\ncontours (strokes). To answer this objective, we developed a new approach that\nuses electromagnetic convolutions and repulsion optimization to compute the\nrequired probabilities. Hence, it becomes possible to generate a continuous\nspace of probability based only on the edge information, thus bridging the gap\nbetween the edge-based methods and the region-based methods. The developed\nmethod is consistent with the fundamental properties of inclusion probabilities\nand its results are validated by comparing an image with the probability-based\nestimation given by our algorithm. The method can also be generalized to take\ninto consideration the intensity of the edges or to be used for 3D shapes. This\nis the first documented method that allows computing a space of probability\nbased on interacting edges, which opens the path to broader applications such\nas image segmentation and contour completion.",
    "America has a massive railway system. As of 2006, U.S. freight railroads have\n140,490 route- miles of standard gauge, but maintaining such a huge system and\neliminating any dangers, like reduced track stability and poor drainage, caused\nby railway ballast degradation require huge amount of labor. The traditional\nway to quantify the degradation of ballast is to use an index called Fouling\nIndex (FI) through ballast sampling and sieve analysis. However, determining\nthe FI values in lab is very time-consuming and laborious, but with the help of\nrecent development in the field of computer vision, a novel method for a\npotential machine-vison based ballast inspection system can be employed that\ncan hopefully replace the traditional mechanical method. The new machine-vision\napproach analyses the images of the in-service ballasts, and then utilizes\nimage segmentation algorithm to get ballast segments. By comparing the segment\nresults and their corresponding FI values, this novel method produces a\nmachine-vision-based index that has the best-fit relation with FI. The\nimplementation details of how this algorithm works are discussed in this\nreport.",
    "This paper aims at developing an integrated system of clothing co-parsing, in\norder to jointly parse a set of clothing images (unsegmented but annotated with\ntags) into semantic configurations. We propose a data-driven framework\nconsisting of two phases of inference. The first phase, referred as \"image\nco-segmentation\", iterates to extract consistent regions on images and jointly\nrefines the regions over all images by employing the exemplar-SVM (E-SVM)\ntechnique [23]. In the second phase (i.e. \"region co-labeling\"), we construct a\nmulti-image graphical model by taking the segmented regions as vertices, and\nincorporate several contexts of clothing configuration (e.g., item location and\nmutual interactions). The joint label assignment can be solved using the\nefficient Graph Cuts algorithm. In addition to evaluate our framework on the\nFashionista dataset [30], we construct a dataset called CCP consisting of 2098\nhigh-resolution street fashion photos to demonstrate the performance of our\nsystem. We achieve 90.29% / 88.23% segmentation accuracy and 65.52% / 63.89%\nrecognition rate on the Fashionista and the CCP datasets, respectively, which\nare superior compared with state-of-the-art methods.",
    "Color and intensity are two important components in an image. Usually, groups\nof image pixels, which are similar in color or intensity, are an informative\nrepresentation for an object. They are therefore particularly suitable for\ncomputer vision tasks, such as saliency detection and object proposal\ngeneration. However, image pixels, which share a similar real-world color, may\nbe quite different since colors are often distorted by intensity. In this\npaper, we reinvestigate the affinity matrices originally used in image\nsegmentation methods based on spectral clustering. A new affinity matrix, which\nis robust to color distortions, is formulated for object discovery. Moreover, a\nCohesion Measurement (CM) for object regions is also derived based on the\nformulated affinity matrix. Based on the new Cohesion Measurement, a novel\nobject discovery method is proposed to discover objects latent in an image by\nutilizing the eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. Then we apply the proposed\nmethod to both saliency detection and object proposal generation. Experimental\nresults on several evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CM based\nmethod has achieved promising performance for these two tasks.",

    "The performance of deep networks for semantic image segmentation largely\ndepends on the availability of large-scale training images which are labelled\nat the pixel level.

To alleviate the burden of manual image\nlabelling, we propose an interesting learning approach to generate pixel-level\nimage labellings automatically. A Guided Filter Network (GFN) is first\ndeveloped to learn the segmentation knowledge from a source domain, and such\nGFN then transfers such segmentation knowledge to generate coarse object masks\nin the target domain. Such coarse object masks are treated as pseudo labels and\nthey are further integrated to optimize/refine the GFN iteratively in the\ntarget domain.

    "Semantic image segmentation is an important computer vision task that is\ndifficult because it consists of both recognition and segmentation. The task is\noften cast as a structured output problem on an exponentially large\noutput-space, which is typically modeled by a discrete probabilistic model. The\nbest segmentation is found by inferring the Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) solution\nover the output distribution defined by the model. Due to limitations in\noptimization, the model cannot be arbitrarily complex. This leads to a\ntrade-off: devise a more accurate model that incorporates rich high-order\ninteractions between image elements at the cost of inaccurate and possibly\nintractable optimization OR leverage a tractable model which produces less\naccurate MAP solutions but may contain high quality solutions as other modes of\nits output distribution.\n  This thesis investigates the latter and presents a two stage approach to\nsemantic segmentation.

As the\ncore component for our DS-TransUNet, a well-designed Transformer Interactive\nFusion (TIF) module is proposed to effectively establish global dependencies\nbetween features of different scales through the self-attention mechanism.\nFurthermore, we also introduce the Swin Transformer block into decoder to\nfurther explore the long-range contextual information during the up-sampling\nprocess. Extensive experiments across four typical tasks for medical image\nsegmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of DS-TransUNet, and show that our\napproach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",
    "  It has been known for over 70 years that there is an asymptotic transition of\nCharlier polynomials to Hermite polynomials. This transition, which is still\npresented in its classical form in modern reference works, is valid if and only\nif a certain parameter is integer. In this light, it is surprising that a much\nmore powerful transition exists from Charlier polynomials to the Hermite\nfunction, valid for any real value of the parameter. This greatly strengthens\nthe asymptotic connections between Charlier polynomials and special functions,\nwith applications for instance in queueing theory.\n  It is shown in this paper that the convergence is uniform in bounded\nintervals, and a sharp rate bound is proved. It is also shown that there is a\ntransition of derivatives of Charlier polynomials to the derivative of the\nHermite function, again with a sharp rate bound. Finally, it is proved that\nzeros of Charlier polynomials converge to zeros of the Hermite function. While\nrigorous, the proofs use only elementary techniques.\n",
    "This paper proposes a novel approach for uncertainty quantification in dense\nConditional Random Fields (CRFs). The presented approach, called\nPerturb-and-MPM, enables efficient, approximate sampling from dense multi-label\nCRFs via random perturbations. An analytic error analysis was performed which\nidentified the main cause of approximation error as well as showed that the\nerror is bounded. Spatial uncertainty maps can be derived from the\nPerturb-and-MPM model, which can be used to visualize uncertainty in image\nsegmentation results. The method is validated on synthetic and clinical\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging data. The effectiveness of the approach is\ndemonstrated on the challenging problem of segmenting the tumor core in\nglioblastoma. We found that areas of high uncertainty correspond well to\nwrongly segmented image regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential use\nof uncertainty maps to refine imaging biomarkers in the case of extent of\nresection and residual tumor volume in brain tumor patients.",
    "  Entanglement does not describe all quantum correlations and several authors\nhave shown the need to go beyond entanglement when dealing with mixed states.\nVarious different measures have sprung up in the literature, for a variety of\nreasons, to describe bipartite and multipartite quantum correlations; some are\nknown under the collective name quantum discord. Yet, in the same sprit as the\ncriteria for entanglement measures, there is no general mechanism that\ndetermines whether a measure of quantum and classical correlations is a proper\nmeasure of correlations. This is partially due to the fact that the answer is a\nbit muddy. In this article we attempt tackle this muddy topic by writing down\nseveral criteria for a \"good\" measure of correlations. We breakup our list into\nnecessary, reasonable, and debatable conditions. We then proceed to prove\nseveral of these conditions for generalized measures of quantum correlations.\nHowever, not all conditions are met by all measures; we show this via several\nexamples. The reasonable conditions are related to continuity of correlations,\nwhich has not been previously discussed. Continuity is an important quality if\none wants to probe quantum correlations in the laboratory. We show that most\ntypes of quantum discord are continuous but none are continuous with respect to\nthe measurement basis used for optimization.\n",
    "  Electron dynamics in crystalline semiconductors is described by\ndistinguishing between an instantaneous velocity related to electron's momentum\nand an average velocity related to its quasi-momentum in a periodic potential.\nIt is shown that the electron velocity used in the theory of electron transport\nand free-carrier optics is the average electron velocity, not the instantaneous\nvelocity. An effective mass of charge carriers in solids is considered and it\nis demonstrated that, in contrast to the \"acceleration\" mass introduced in\ntextbooks, it is a \"velocity\" mass relating carrier velocity to its\nquasi-momentum that is a much more useful physical quantity. Among other\nadvantages, the velocity mass is a scalar for spherical but nonparabolic energy\nbands $\\epsilon(k)$, whereas the acceleration mass is not a scalar. Important\napplications of the velocity mass are indicated. A two-band ${\\bm k}\\cdot {\\bm\n\\hp}$ model is introduced as the simplest example of a band structure that\nstill keeps track of the periodic lattice potential. It is remarked that the\ntwo-band model, adequately describing narrow-gap semiconductors (including\nzero-gap graphene), strongly resembles the special theory of relativity.\nInstructive examples of the \"semi-relativistic\" analogy are given. The\npresentation has both scientific and pedagogical aspects.\n",
    "  In this report we have analyzed a simple effective model for a description of\nmagnetically ordered insulators.

For the first time the\nphase diagrams of this model have been determined within Monte Carlo simulation\non 2D-square lattice. They have been compared with results obtained within\nvariational approach, which treats the on-site term exactly and the intersite\ninteractions within mean-field approximation.

    "Cloud based medical image analysis has become popular recently due to the\nhigh computation complexities of various deep neural network (DNN) based\nframeworks and the increasingly large volume of medical images that need to be\nprocessed. It has been demonstrated that for medical images the transmission\nfrom local to clouds is much more expensive than the computation in the clouds\nitself. Towards this, 3D image compression techniques have been widely applied\nto reduce the data traffic. However, most of the existing image compression\ntechniques are developed around human vision, i.e., they are designed to\nminimize distortions that can be perceived by human eyes. In this paper we will\nuse deep learning based medical image segmentation as a vehicle and demonstrate\nthat interestingly, machine and human view the compression quality differently.\nMedical images compressed with good quality w.r.t. human vision may result in\ninferior segmentation accuracy. We then design a machine vision oriented 3D\nimage compression framework tailored for segmentation using DNNs. Our method\nautomatically extracts and retains image features that are most important to\nthe segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on widely adopted segmentation\nframeworks with HVSMR 2016 challenge dataset show that our method can achieve\nsignificantly higher segmentation accuracy at the same compression rate, or\nmuch better compression rate under the same segmentation accuracy, when\ncompared with the existing JPEG 2000 method. To the best of the authors'\nknowledge, this is the first machine vision guided medical image compression\nframework for segmentation in the clouds.",
    "The joint use of multiple imaging modalities for medical image segmentation\nhas been widely studied in recent years. The fusion of information from\ndifferent modalities has demonstrated to improve the segmentation accuracy,\nwith respect to mono-modal segmentations, in several applications. However,\nacquiring multiple modalities is usually not possible in a clinical setting due\nto a limited number of physicians and scanners, and to limit costs and scan\ntime. Most of the time, only one modality is acquired. In this paper, we\npropose KD-Net, a framework to transfer knowledge from a trained multi-modal\nnetwork (teacher) to a mono-modal one (student). The proposed method is an\nadaptation of the generalized distillation framework where the student network\nis trained on a subset (1 modality) of the teacher's inputs (n modalities). We\nillustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in brain tumor\nsegmentation with the BraTS 2018 dataset. Using different architectures, we\nshow that the student network effectively learns from the teacher and always\noutperforms the baseline mono-modal network in terms of segmentation accuracy.",
    "Image segmentation with a volume constraint is an important prior for many\nreal applications. In this work, we present a novel volume preserving image\nsegmentation algorithm, which is based on the framework of entropic regularized\noptimal transport theory. The classical Total Variation (TV) regularizer and\nvolume preserving are integrated into a regularized optimal transport model,\nand the volume and classification constraints can be regarded as two measures\npreserving constraints in the optimal transport problem. By studying the dual\nproblem, we develop a simple and efficient dual algorithm for our model.\nMoreover, to be different from many variational based image segmentation\nalgorithms, the proposed algorithm can be directly unrolled to a new Volume\nPreserving and TV regularized softmax (VPTV-softmax) layer for semantic\nsegmentation in the popular Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN). The\nexperiment results show that our proposed model is very competitive and can\nimprove the performance of many semantic segmentation nets such as the popular\nU-net.",
    "Several supermodular losses have been shown to improve the perceptual quality\nof image segmentation in a discriminative framework such as a structured output\nsupport vector machine (SVM). These loss functions do not necessarily have the\nsame structure as the one used by the segmentation inference algorithm, and in\ngeneral, we may have to resort to generic submodular minimization algorithms\nfor loss augmented inference. Although these come with polynomial time\nguarantees, they are not practical to apply to image scale data. Many\nsupermodular losses come with strong optimization guarantees, but are not\nreadily incorporated in a loss augmented graph cuts procedure. This motivates\nour strategy of employing the alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM) decomposition for loss augmented inference. In doing so, we create a new\nAPI for the structured SVM that separates the maximum a posteriori (MAP)\ninference of the model from the loss augmentation during training. In this way,\nwe gain computational efficiency, making new choices of loss functions\npractical for the first time, while simultaneously making the inference\nalgorithm employed during training closer to the test time procedure. We show\nimprovement both in accuracy and computational performance on the Microsoft\nResearch Grabcut database and a brain structure segmentation task, empirically\nvalidating the use of several supermodular loss functions during training, and\nthe improved computational properties of the proposed ADMM approach over the\nFujishige-Wolfe minimum norm point algorithm.",
    "In this paper, we propose to tackle the problem of reducing discrepancies\nbetween multiple domains referred to as multi-source domain adaptation and\nconsider it under the target shift assumption: in all domains we aim to solve a\nclassification problem with the same output classes, but with labels'\nproportions differing across them. This problem, generally ignored in the vast\nmajority papers on domain adaptation papers, is nevertheless critical in\nreal-world applications, and we theoretically show its impact on the adaptation\nsuccess. To address this issue, we design a method based on optimal transport,\na theory that has been successfully used to tackle adaptation problems in\nmachine learning. Our method performs multi-source adaptation and target shift\ncorrection simultaneously by learning the class probabilities of the unlabeled\ntarget sample and the coupling allowing to align two (or more) probability\ndistributions. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data related to\nsatellite image segmentation task show the superiority of the proposed method\nover the state-of-the-art.",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have the capability of synthesizing\nimages, which have been successfully applied to medical image synthesis tasks.\nHowever, most of existing methods merely consider the global contextual\ninformation and ignore the fine foreground structures, e.g., vessel, skeleton,\nwhich may contain diagnostic indicators for medical image analysis. Inspired by\nhuman painting procedure, which is composed of stroking and color rendering\nsteps, we propose a Sketching-rendering Unconditional Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (SkrGAN) to introduce a sketch prior constraint to guide the medical\nimage generation. In our SkrGAN, a sketch guidance module is utilized to\ngenerate a high quality structural sketch from random noise, then a color\nrender mapping is used to embed the sketch-based representations and resemble\nthe background appearances. Experimental results show that the proposed SkrGAN\nachieves the state-of-the-art results in synthesizing images for various image\nmodalities, including retinal color fundus, X-Ray, Computed Tomography (CT) and\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

    "  We extend the Wigner-Weyl-Moyal phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics\nto general curved configuration spaces. The underlying phase space is based on\nthe chosen coordinates of the manifold and their canonically conjugate momenta.\nThe resulting Wigner function displays the axioms of a quasiprobability\ndistribution, and any Weyl-ordered operator gets associated with the\ncorresponding phase-space function, even in the absence of continuous\nsymmetries. The corresponding quantum Liouville equation reduces to the\nclassical curved space Liouville equation in the semiclassical limit. We\ndemonstrate the formalism for a point particle moving on two-dimensional\nmanifolds, such as a paraboloid or the surface of a sphere.

    "Semantic image segmentation is one of the most challenged tasks in computer\nvision. In this paper, we propose a highly fused convolutional network, which\nconsists of three parts: feature downsampling, combined feature upsampling and\nmultiple predictions. We adopt a strategy of multiple steps of upsampling and\ncombined feature maps in pooling layers with its corresponding unpooling\nlayers. Then we bring out multiple pre-outputs, each pre-output is generated\nfrom an unpooling layer by one-step upsampling. Finally, we concatenate these\npre-outputs to get the final output. As a result, our proposed network makes\nhighly use of the feature information by fusing and reusing feature maps. In\naddition, when training our model, we add multiple soft cost functions on\npre-outputs and final outputs. In this way, we can reduce the loss reduction\nwhen the loss is back propagated.

    "  The high beam current and sub-angstrom resolution of aberration-corrected\nscanning transmission electron microscopes has enabled electron energy loss\nspectroscopic (EELS) mapping with atomic resolution. These spectral maps are\noften dose-limited and spatially oversampled, leading to low counts/channel and\nare thus highly sensitive to errors in background estimation. However, by\ntaking advantage of redundancy in the dataset map one can improve background\nestimation and increase chemical sensitivity. We consider two such approaches-\nlinear combination of power laws and local background averaging-that reduce\nbackground error and improve signal extraction. Principal components analysis\n(PCA) can also be used to analyze spectrum images, but the poor\npeak-to-background ratio in EELS can lead to serious artifacts if raw EELS data\nis PCA filtered. We identify common artifacts and discuss alternative\napproaches. These algorithms are implemented within the Cornell Spectrum\nImager, an open source software package for spectroscopic analysis.\n",
    "  Computing problems that handle large amounts of data necessitate the use of\nlossless data compression for efficient storage and transmission. We present a\nnovel lossless universal data compression algorithm that uses parallel\ncomputational units to increase the throughput. The length-$N$ input sequence\nis partitioned into $B$ blocks. Processing each block independently of the\nother blocks can accelerate the computation by a factor of $B$, but degrades\nthe compression quality. Instead, our approach is to first estimate the minimum\ndescription length (MDL) context tree source underlying the entire input, and\nthen encode each of the $B$ blocks in parallel based on the MDL source. With\nthis two-pass approach, the compression loss incurred by using more parallel\nunits is insignificant. Our algorithm is work-efficient, i.e., its\ncomputational complexity is $O(N/B)$. Its redundancy is approximately\n$B\\log(N/B)$ bits above Rissanen's lower bound on universal compression\nperformance, with respect to any context tree source whose maximal depth is at\nmost $\\log(N/B)$. We improve the compression by using different quantizers for\nstates of the context tree based on the number of symbols corresponding to\nthose states. Numerical results from a prototype implementation suggest that\nour algorithm offers a better trade-off between compression and throughput than\ncompeting universal data compression algorithms.\n",

    "Purpose: To improve kidney segmentation in clinical ultrasound (US) images,\nwe develop a new graph cuts based method to segment kidney US images by\nintegrating original image intensity information and texture feature maps\nextracted using Gabor filters. Methods: To handle large appearance variation\nwithin kidney images and improve computational efficiency, we build a graph of\nimage pixels close to kidney boundary instead of building a graph of the whole\nimage. To make the kidney segmentation robust to weak boundaries, we adopt\nlocalized regional information to measure similarity between image pixels for\ncomputing edge weights to build the graph of image pixels. The localized graph\nis dynamically updated and the GC based segmentation iteratively progresses\nuntil convergence. The proposed method has been evaluated and compared with\nstate of the art image segmentation methods based on clinical kidney US images\nof 85 subjects. We randomly selected US images of 20 subjects as training data\nfor tuning the parameters, and validated the methods based on US images of the\nremaining 65 subjects.

Results: Experiment results demonstrated that the proposed method\nobtained segmentation results for bilateral kidneys of 65 subjects with average\nDice index of 0.9581, Jaccard index of 0.9204, and Mean Distance of 1.7166,\nbetter than other methods under comparison (p<10-19, paired Wilcoxon rank sum\ntests). Conclusions: The proposed method achieved promising performance for\nsegmenting kidneys in US images, better than segmentation methods that built on\nany single channel of image information. This method will facilitate extraction\nof kidney characteristics that may predict important clinical outcomes such\nprogression chronic kidney disease.",
    "Many computer vision problems can be formulated as binary quadratic programs\n(BQPs).

Spectral relaxation is simple and easy to\nimplement, but its bound is loose. Semidefinite relaxation has a tighter bound,\nbut its computational complexity is high for large scale problems. We present a\nnew SDP formulation for BQPs, with two desirable properties. First, it has a\nsimilar relaxation bound to conventional SDP formulations. Second, compared\nwith conventional SDP methods, the new SDP formulation leads to a significantly\nmore efficient and scalable dual optimization approach, which has the same\ndegree of complexity as spectral methods.

    "The goal of this paper is to present a new efficient image segmentation\nmethod based on evolutionary computation which is a model inspired from human\nbehavior. Based on this model, a four layer process for image segmentation is\nproposed using the split/merge approach. In the first layer, an image is split\ninto numerous regions using the watershed algorithm. In the second layer, a\nco-evolutionary process is applied to form centers of finals segments by\nmerging similar primary regions. In the third layer, a meta-heuristic process\nuses two operators to connect the residual regions to their corresponding\ndetermined centers. In the final layer, an evolutionary algorithm is used to\ncombine the resulted similar and neighbor regions. Different layers of the\nalgorithm are totally independent, therefore for certain applications a\nspecific layer can be changed without constraint of changing other layers. Some\nproperties of this algorithm like the flexibility of its method, the ability to\nuse different feature vectors for segmentation (grayscale, color, texture,\netc), the ability to control uniformity and the number of final segments using\nfree parameters and also maintaining small regions, makes it possible to apply\nthe algorithm to different applications. Moreover, the independence of each\nregion from other regions in the second layer, and the independence of centers\nin the third layer, makes parallel implementation possible. As a result the\nalgorithm speed will increase. The presented algorithm was tested on a standard\ndataset (BSDS 300) of images, and the region boundaries were compared with\ndifferent people segmentation contours.

    "One popular approach to interactively segment the foreground object of\ninterest from an image is to annotate a bounding box that covers the foreground\nobject. Then, a binary labeling is performed to achieve a refined segmentation.\nOne major issue of the existing algorithms for such interactive image\nsegmentation is their preference of an input bounding box that tightly encloses\nthe foreground object. This increases the annotation burden, and prevents these\nalgorithms from utilizing automatically detected bounding boxes. In this paper,\nwe develop a new LooseCut algorithm that can handle cases where the input\nbounding box only loosely covers the foreground object. We propose a new Markov\nRandom Fields (MRF) model for segmentation with loosely bounded boxes,\nincluding a global similarity constraint to better distinguish the foreground\nand background, and an additional energy term to encourage consistent labeling\nof similar-appearance pixels. This MRF model is then solved by an iterated\nmax-flow algorithm. In the experiments, we evaluate LooseCut in three\npublicly-available image datasets, and compare its performance against several\nstate-of-the-art interactive image segmentation algorithms.

    "Machine learning has been widely adopted for medical image analysis in recent\nyears given its promising performance in image segmentation and classification\ntasks. As a data-driven science, the success of machine learning, in particular\nsupervised learning, largely depends on the availability of manually annotated\ndatasets. For medical imaging applications, such annotated datasets are not\neasy to acquire. It takes a substantial amount of time and resource to curate\nan annotated medical image set. In this paper, we propose an efficient\nannotation framework for brain tumour images that is able to suggest\ninformative sample images for human experts to annotate. Our experiments show\nthat training a segmentation model with only 19% suggestively annotated patient\nscans from BraTS 2019 dataset can achieve a comparable performance to training\na model on the full dataset for whole tumour segmentation task. It demonstrates\na promising way to save manual annotation cost and improve data efficiency in\nmedical imaging applications.",
    "  This paper aims at constructing a good graph for discovering intrinsic data\nstructures in a semi-supervised learning setting. Firstly, we propose to build\na non-negative low-rank and sparse (referred to as NNLRS) graph for the given\ndata representation. Specifically, the weights of edges in the graph are\nobtained by seeking a nonnegative low-rank and sparse matrix that represents\neach data sample as a linear combination of others. The so-obtained NNLRS-graph\ncan capture both the global mixture of subspaces structure (by the low\nrankness) and the locally linear structure (by the sparseness) of the data,\nhence is both generative and discriminative. Secondly, as good features are\nextremely important for constructing a good graph, we propose to learn the data\nembedding matrix and construct the graph jointly within one framework, which is\ntermed as NNLRS with embedded features (referred to as NNLRS-EF). Extensive\nexperiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art graph construction method by a large\nmargin for both semi-supervised classification and discriminative analysis,\nwhich verifies the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n",

We achieve competitive results outperforming popular hourglass networks\nby up to 17 percentage points.",
    "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning the image into significant\nregions easier to analyze. Nowadays, segmentation has become a necessity in\nmany practical medical imaging methods as locating tumors and diseases. Hidden\nMarkov Random Field model is one of several techniques used in image\nsegmentation. It provides an elegant way to model the segmentation process.\nThis modeling leads to the minimization of an objective function.

    "Deep learning techniques for 3D brain vessel image segmentation have not been\nas successful as in the segmentation of other organs and tissues. This can be\nexplained by two factors. First, deep learning techniques tend to show poor\nperformances at the segmentation of relatively small objects compared to the\nsize of the full image. Second, due to the complexity of vascular trees and the\nsmall size of vessels, it is challenging to obtain the amount of annotated\ntraining data typically needed by deep learning methods. To address these\nproblems, we propose a novel annotation-efficient deep learning vessel\nsegmentation framework. The framework avoids pixel-wise annotations, only\nrequiring weak patch-level labels to discriminate between vessel and non-vessel\n2D patches in the training set, in a setup similar to the CAPTCHAs used to\ndifferentiate humans from bots in web applications. The user-provided weak\nannotations are used for two tasks: 1) to synthesize pixel-wise pseudo-labels\nfor vessels and background in each patch, which are used to train a\nsegmentation network, and 2) to train a classifier network. The classifier\nnetwork allows to generate additional weak patch labels, further reducing the\nannotation burden, and it acts as a noise filter for poor quality images. We\nuse this framework for the segmentation of the cerebrovascular tree in\nTime-of-Flight angiography (TOF) and Susceptibility-Weighted Images (SWI).

We propose\nfour different point cloud simplification methods which decimate the perceived\npoint cloud by relying on class-specific local and global statistics still\nmaintaining more points in the proximity of class boundaries to preserve the\ninfra-class edges and discontinuities. 3D dense model is obtained by fusing the\npoint clouds in a 3D Delaunay Triangulation to deal with variable point cloud\ndensity.

    "To improve the classification performance in the context of hyperspectral\nimage processing, many works have been developed based on two common\nstrategies, namely the spatial-spectral information integration and the\nutilization of neural networks. However, both strategies typically require more\ntraining data than the classical algorithms, aggregating the shortage of\nlabeled samples.

The deep metric learning model is supervised by the\ncenter loss to produce spectrum-based features that gather more tightly in\nEuclidean space within classes. The conditional random field with Gaussian edge\npotentials, which is firstly proposed for image segmentation tasks, is\nintroduced to give the pixel-wise classification over the hyperspectral image\nby utilizing both the geographical distances between pixels and the Euclidean\ndistances between the features produced by the deep metric learning model. The\nproposed framework is trained by spectral pixels at the deep metric learning\nstage and utilizes the half handcrafted spatial features at the conditional\nrandom field stage.

In\naddition, the multi-way clustering can be obtained by combining a set of binary\ndecision functions via an Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) encoding scheme.\nBecause of its model-based nature, the KSC method encompasses three main steps:\ntraining, validation, testing. In the validation stage model selection is\nperformed to obtain tuning parameters, like the number of clusters present in\nthe data. This is a major advantage compared to classical spectral clustering\nwhere the determination of the clustering parameters is unclear and relies on\nheuristics. Once a KSC model is trained on a small subset of the entire data,\nit is able to generalize well to unseen test points. Beyond the basic\nformulation, sparse KSC algorithms based on the Incomplete Cholesky\nDecomposition (ICD) and $L_0$, $L_1, L_0 + L_1$, Group Lasso regularization are\nreviewed. In that respect, we show how it is possible to handle large scale\ndata. Also, two possible ways to perform hierarchical clustering and a soft\nclustering method are presented. Finally, real-world applications such as image\nsegmentation, power load time-series clustering, document clustering and big\ndata learning are considered.",

    "Standard segmentation of medical images based on full-supervised\nconvolutional networks demands accurate dense annotations. Such learning\nframework is built on laborious manual annotation with restrict demands for\nexpertise, leading to insufficient high-quality labels. To overcome such\nlimitation and exploit massive weakly labeled data, we relaxed the rigid\nlabeling requirement and developed a semi-supervised learning framework based\non a teacher-student fashion for organ and lesion segmentation with partial\ndense-labeled supervision and supplementary loose bounding-box supervision\nwhich are easier to acquire. Observing the geometrical relation of an organ and\nits inner lesions in most cases, we propose a hierarchical organ-to-lesion\n(O2L) attention module in a teacher segmentor to produce pseudo-labels. Then a\nstudent segmentor is trained with combinations of manual-labeled and\npseudo-labeled annotations. We further proposed a localization branch realized\nvia an aggregation of high-level features in a deep decoder to predict\nlocations of organ and lesion, which enriches student segmentor with precise\nlocalization information. We validated each design in our model on LiTS\nchallenge datasets by ablation study and showed its state-of-the-art\nperformance compared with recent methods.

    "Even though convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are driving progress in\nmedical image segmentation, standard models still have some drawbacks. First,\nthe use of multi-scale approaches, i.e., encoder-decoder architectures, leads\nto a redundant use of information, where similar low-level features are\nextracted multiple times at multiple scales. Second, long-range feature\ndependencies are not efficiently modeled, resulting in non-optimal\ndiscriminative feature representations associated with each semantic class. In\nthis paper we attempt to overcome these limitations with the proposed\narchitecture, by capturing richer contextual dependencies based on the use of\nguided self-attention mechanisms. This approach is able to integrate local\nfeatures with their corresponding global dependencies, as well as highlight\ninterdependent channel maps in an adaptive manner. Further, the additional loss\nbetween different modules guides the attention mechanisms to neglect irrelevant\ninformation and focus on more discriminant regions of the image by emphasizing\nrelevant feature associations. We evaluate the proposed model in the context of\nsemantic segmentation on three different datasets: abdominal organs,\ncardiovascular structures and brain tumors. A series of ablation experiments\nsupport the importance of these attention modules in the proposed architecture.\nIn addition, compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation networks our model\nyields better segmentation performance, increasing the accuracy of the\npredictions while reducing the standard deviation. This demonstrates the\nefficiency of our approach to generate precise and reliable automatic\nsegmentations of medical images.

    "Deep learning based models, generally, require a large number of samples for\nappropriate training, a requirement that is difficult to satisfy in the medical\nfield. This issue can usually be avoided with a proper initialization of the\nweights. On the task of medical image segmentation in general, two techniques\nare oftentimes employed to tackle the training of a deep network $f_T$. The\nfirst one consists in reusing some weights of a network $f_S$ pre-trained on a\nlarge scale database ($e.g.$ ImageNet). This procedure, also known as\n$transfer$ $learning$, happens to reduce the flexibility when it comes to new\nnetwork design since $f_T$ is constrained to match some parts of $f_S$. The\nsecond commonly used technique consists in working on image patches to benefit\nfrom the large number of available patches. This paper brings together these\ntwo techniques and propose to train $arbitrarily$ $designed$ $networks$ that\nsegment an image in one forward pass, with a focus on relatively small\ndatabases. An experimental work have been carried out on the tasks of retinal\nblood vessel segmentation and the optic disc one, using four publicly available\ndatabases. Furthermore, three types of network are considered, going from a\nvery light weighted network to a densely connected one. The final results show\nthe efficiency of the proposed framework along with state of the art results on\nall the databases.",

    "Generalising deep models to new data from new centres (termed here domains)\nremains a challenge. This is largely attributed to shifts in data statistics\n(domain shifts) between source and unseen domains. Recently, gradient-based\nmeta-learning approaches where the training data are split into meta-train and\nmeta-test sets to simulate and handle the domain shifts during training have\nshown improved generalisation performance. However, the current fully\nsupervised meta-learning approaches are not scalable for medical image\nsegmentation, where large effort is required to create pixel-wise annotations.\nMeanwhile, in a low data regime, the simulated domain shifts may not\napproximate the true domain shifts well across source and unseen domains. To\naddress this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised meta-learning\nframework with disentanglement. We explicitly model the representations related\nto domain shifts. Disentangling the representations and combining them to\nreconstruct the input image allows unlabeled data to be used to better\napproximate the true domain shifts for meta-learning. Hence, the model can\nachieve better generalisation performance, especially when there is a limited\namount of labeled data.

    "  We compute the relative-order-v^4 contribution to gluon fragmentation into\nquarkonium in the 3S1 color-singlet channel, using the nonrelativistic QCD\n(NRQCD) factorization approach. The QCD fragmentation process contains infrared\ndivergences that produce single and double poles in epsilon in 4-2epsilon\ndimensions. We devise subtractions that isolate the pole contributions, which\nultimately are absorbed into long-distance NRQCD matrix elements in the NRQCD\nmatching procedure. The matching procedure involves two-loop renormalizations\nof the NRQCD operators. The subtractions are integrated over the phase space\nanalytically in 4-2epsilon dimensions, and the remainder is integrated over the\nphase-space numerically. We find that the order-v^4 contribution is enhanced\nrelative to the order-v^0 contribution. However, the order-v^4 contribution is\nnot important numerically at the current level of precision of\nquarkonium-hadroproduction phenomenology.

    "  Phases of matter are conventionally characterized by order parameters\ndescribing the type and degree of order in a system.

These two\nexamples reflect two classes of phase transitions: the melting of a crystal is\na first-order phase transition (the crystalline order vanishes abruptly) and\nthe onset of magnetism is a second- order phase transition (the magnetization\nincreases continuously from zero as the temperature falls below TC). Such\nmagnetism is robust in systems with localized magnetic particles, and yet rare\nin model itinerant systems where the particles are free to move about. Here for\nthe first time, we explore the itinerant magnetic phases present in a spin-1\nspin-orbit coupled atomic Bose gas; in this system, itinerant ferromagnetic\norder is stabilized by the spin-orbit coupling, vanishing in its absence. We\nfirst located a second-order phase transition that continuously stiffens until,\nat a tricritical point, it transforms into a first- order transition (with\nobserved width as small as h x 4 Hz).

    "  We present a proof of Rider's unpublished result that the union of two Sidon\nsets in the dual of a non-commutative compact group is Sidon, and that randomly\nSidon sets are Sidon. Most likely this proof is essentially the one announced\nby Rider and communicated in a letter to the author around 1979 (lost by him\nsince then). The key fact is a spectral gap property with respect to certain\nrepresentations of the unitary groups $U(n)$ that holds uniformly over $n$. The\nproof crucially uses Weyl's character formulae. We survey the results that we\nobtained 30 years ago using Rider's unpublished results. Using a recent\ndifferent approach valid for certain orthonormal systems of matrix valued\nfunctions, we give a new proof of the spectral gap property that is required to\nshow that the union of two Sidon sets is Sidon. The latter proof yields a\nrather good quantitative estimate. Several related results are discussed with\npossible applications to random matrix theory.\n",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks have significantly boosted the performance\nof fundus image segmentation when test datasets have the same distribution as\nthe training datasets. However, in clinical practice, medical images often\nexhibit variations in appearance for various reasons, e.g., different scanner\nvendors and image quality. These distribution discrepancies could lead the deep\nnetworks to over-fit on the training datasets and lack generalization ability\non the unseen test datasets. To alleviate this issue, we present a novel\nDomain-oriented Feature Embedding (DoFE) framework to improve the\ngeneralization ability of CNNs on unseen target domains by exploring the\nknowledge from multiple source domains. Our DoFE framework dynamically enriches\nthe image features with additional domain prior knowledge learned from\nmulti-source domains to make the semantic features more discriminative.\nSpecifically, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Pool to learn and memorize the\nprior information extracted from multi-source domains. Then the original image\nfeatures are augmented with domain-oriented aggregated features, which are\ninduced from the knowledge pool based on the similarity between the input image\nand multi-source domain images. We further design a novel domain code\nprediction branch to infer this similarity and employ an attention-guided\nmechanism to dynamically combine the aggregated features with the semantic\nfeatures. We comprehensively evaluate our DoFE framework on two fundus image\nsegmentation tasks, including the optic cup and disc segmentation and vessel\nsegmentation. Our DoFE framework generates satisfying segmentation results on\nunseen datasets and surpasses other domain generalization and network\nregularization methods.",
    "Robust cross-seasonal localization is one of the major challenges in\nlong-term visual navigation of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we exploit\nrecent advances in semantic segmentation of images, i.e., where each pixel is\nassigned a label related to the type of object it represents, to attack the\nproblem of long-term visual localization. We show that semantically labeled 3-D\npoint maps of the environment, together with semantically segmented images, can\nbe efficiently used for vehicle localization without the need for detailed\nfeature descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc.). Thus, instead of depending on\nhand-crafted feature descriptors, we rely on the training of an image\nsegmenter. The resulting map takes up much less storage space compared to a\ntraditional descriptor based map. A particle filter based semantic localization\nsolution is compared to one based on SIFT-features, and even with large\nseasonal variations over the year we perform on par with the larger and more\ndescriptive SIFT-features, and are able to localize with an error below 1 m\nmost of the time.",

This\nfilter is used in an approximate imaging scheme, combining a single time lens\nand a single dispersive section and operating as a time reversing device, with\npotential applications in radio-frequency signal processing. This scheme is\nclosely related to three-pulse photon echo with chirped pulses but the\nconnection with temporal imaging and dispersive filtering emphasizes new\nfeatures.\n",
    "A large labeled dataset is a key to the success of supervised deep learning,\nbut for medical image segmentation, it is highly challenging to obtain\nsufficient annotated images for model training. In many scenarios, unannotated\nimages are abundant and easy to acquire. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has\nshown great potentials in exploiting raw data information and representation\nlearning. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Supervised Learning\n(HSSL), a new self-supervised framework that boosts medical image segmentation\nby making good use of unannotated data. Unlike the current literature on\ntask-specific self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning,\nwe utilize SSL to learn task-agnostic knowledge from heterogeneous data for\nvarious medical image segmentation tasks. Specifically, we first aggregate a\ndataset from several medical challenges, then pre-train the network in a\nself-supervised manner, and finally fine-tune on labeled data. We develop a new\nloss function by combining contrastive loss and classification loss and\npretrain an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation tasks. Our extensive\nexperiments show that multi-domain joint pre-training benefits downstream\nsegmentation tasks and outperforms single-domain pre-training significantly.\nCompared to learning from scratch, our new method yields better performance on\nvarious tasks (e.g., +0.69% to +18.60% in Dice scores with 5% of annotated\ndata). With limited amounts of training data, our method can substantially\nbridge the performance gap w.r.t. denser annotations (e.g., 10% vs.~100% of\nannotated data).",

We\nthen show that our algorithm is a useful primitive allowing quantum computers\nto rapidly solve a wide variety of problems regarding finite rings. In\nparticular we show how to test whether two ideals are identical, find their\nintersection, find their quotient, prove whether a given ring element belongs\nto a given ideal, prove whether a given element is a unit, and if so find its\ninverse, find the additive and multiplicative identities, compute the order of\nan ideal, solve linear equations over rings, decide whether an ideal is\nmaximal, find annihilators, and test the injectivity and surjectivity of ring\nhomomorphisms.

    "  By regarding the Lifshitz expression for the Casimir free energy on the real\nfrequency axis rather than the imaginary Matsubara frequencies as is customary,\nnew light is shed on the ongoing debate regarding the thermodynamical\nconsistency of this theory in combination with common permittivity models. It\nis argued that when permittivity is temperature independent over a temperature\ninterval including zero temperature, a cavity made of causal material with\ncontinuous dispersion properties separated by vacuum cannot violate Nernst's\ntheorem (the third law of thermodynamics). The purported violation of this\ntheorem pertains to divergencies in the double limit in which frequency and\ntemperature vanish simultaneously. While any model should abide by the laws of\nthermodynamics within its range of applicability, we emphasise that the Nernst\nheat theorem is a relevant criterion for choosing amongst candidate theories\nonly when these theories are fully applicable at zero temperature and\nfrequency.\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance for automatic medical image segmentation. However, they have not\ndemonstrated sufficiently accurate and robust results for clinical use. In\naddition, they are limited by the lack of image-specific adaptation and the\nlack of generalizability to previously unseen object classes. To address these\nproblems, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for interactive\nsegmentation by incorporating CNNs into a bounding box and scribble-based\nsegmentation pipeline. We propose image-specific fine-tuning to make a CNN\nmodel adaptive to a specific test image, which can be either unsupervised\n(without additional user interactions) or supervised (with additional\nscribbles). We also propose a weighted loss function considering network and\ninteraction-based uncertainty for the fine-tuning. We applied this framework to\ntwo applications: 2D segmentation of multiple organs from fetal MR slices,\nwhere only two types of these organs were annotated for training; and 3D\nsegmentation of brain tumor core (excluding edema) and whole brain tumor\n(including edema) from different MR sequences, where only tumor cores in one MR\nsequence were annotated for training. Experimental results show that 1) our\nmodel is more robust to segment previously unseen objects than state-of-the-art\nCNNs; 2) image-specific fine-tuning with the proposed weighted loss function\nsignificantly improves segmentation accuracy; and 3) our method leads to\naccurate results with fewer user interactions and less user time than\ntraditional interactive segmentation methods.",
    "Compared with common image segmentation tasks targeted at low-resolution\nimages, higher resolution detailed image segmentation receives much less\nattention. In this paper, we propose and study a task named Meticulous Object\nSegmentation (MOS), which is focused on segmenting well-defined foreground\nobjects with elaborate shapes in high resolution images (e.g. 2k - 4k). To this\nend, we propose the MeticulousNet which leverages a dedicated decoder to\ncapture the object boundary details. Specifically, we design a Hierarchical\nPoint-wise Refining (HierPR) block to better delineate object boundaries, and\nreformulate the decoding process as a recursive coarse to fine refinement of\nthe object mask. To evaluate segmentation quality near object boundaries, we\npropose the Meticulosity Quality (MQ) score considering both the mask coverage\nand boundary precision. In addition, we collect a MOS benchmark dataset\nincluding 600 high quality images with complex objects. We provide\ncomprehensive empirical evidence showing that MeticulousNet can reveal\npixel-accurate segmentation boundaries and is superior to state-of-the-art\nmethods for high resolution object segmentation tasks.",
    "In medical imaging, the heterogeneity of multi-centre data impedes the\napplicability of deep learning-based methods and results in significant\nperformance degradation when applying models in an unseen data domain, e.g. a\nnew centreor a new scanner. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain\nadaptation framework for boosting image segmentation performance across\nmultiple domains without using any manual annotations from the new target\ndomains, but by re-calibrating the networks on few images from the target\ndomain. To achieve this, we enforce architectures to be adaptive to new data by\nrejecting improbable segmentation patterns and implicitly learning through\nsemantic and boundary information, thus to capture disease-specific spatial\npatterns in an adversarial optimization. The adaptation process needs\ncontinuous monitoring, however, as we cannot assume the presence of\nground-truth masks for the target domain, we propose two new metrics to monitor\nthe adaptation process, and strategies to train the segmentation algorithm in a\nstable fashion. We build upon well-established 2D and 3D architectures and\nperform extensive experiments on three cross-centre brain lesion segmentation\ntasks, involving multicentre public and in-house datasets. We demonstrate that\nrecalibrating the deep networks on a few unlabeled images from the target\ndomain improves the segmentation accuracy significantly.",
    "  The physical processes that control the partition of released magnetic energy\nbetween electrons and ions during reconnection is explored through\nparticle-in-cell simulations and analytical techniques. We demonstrate that the\ndevelopment of a large-scale parallel electric field and its associated\npotential controls the relative heating of electrons and ions. The potential\ndevelops to restrain heated exhaust electrons and enhances their heating by\nconfining electrons in the region where magnetic energy is released.\nSimultaneously the potential slows ions entering the exhaust below the\nAlfv\\'enic speed expected from the traditional counterstreaming picture of ion\nheating. Unexpectedly, the magnitude of the potential and therefore the\nrelative partition of energy between electrons and ions is not a constant but\nrather depends on the upstream parameters and specifically the upstream\nelectron normalized temperature (electron beta). These findings suggest that\nthe fraction of magnetic energy converted into the total thermal energy may be\nindependent of upstream parameters.\n",
    "Most existing black-box optimization methods assume that all variables in the\nsystem being optimized have equal cost and can change freely at each iteration.\nHowever, in many real world systems, inputs are passed through a sequence of\ndifferent operations or modules, making variables in earlier stages of\nprocessing more costly to update. Such structure imposes a cost on switching\nvariables in early parts of a data processing pipeline. In this work, we\npropose a new algorithm for switch cost-aware optimization called Lazy Modular\nBayesian Optimization (LaMBO). This method efficiently identifies the global\noptimum while minimizing cost through a passive change of variables in early\nmodules. The method is theoretical grounded and achieves vanishing regret when\naugmented with switching cost. We apply LaMBO to multiple synthetic functions\nand a three-stage image segmentation pipeline used in a neuroscience\napplication, where we obtain promising improvements over prevailing cost-aware\nBayesian optimization algorithms. Our results demonstrate that LaMBO is an\neffective strategy for black-box optimization that is capable of minimizing\nswitching costs in modular systems.",
    "  We consider Bloch oscillations of ultracold atoms stored in a one-dimensional\nvertical optical lattice and simultaneously interacting with a unidirectionally\npumped optical ring cavity whose vertical arm is collinear with the optical\nlattice.

It also stabilizes Bloch oscillations\nagainst noise, and even suppresses dephasing due to atom-atom interactions.\nFurthermore, it generates periodic bursts of light emitted into the\ncounter-propagating cavity mode, providing a non-destructive monitor of the\natomic dynamics. All these features may be crucial for future improvements of\nthe design of atomic gravimeters based on recording Bloch oscillations.\n",
    "Volumetric image segmentation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nencounters several challenges, which are specific to medical images.

    "Although spatial information of images usually enhance the robustness of the\nFuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm, it greatly increases the computational costs for\nimage segmentation. To achieve a sound trade-off between the segmentation\nperformance and the speed of clustering, we come up with a Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergence-based FCM algorithm by incorporating a tight wavelet frame\ntransform and a morphological reconstruction operation. To enhance FCM's\nrobustness, an observed image is first filtered by using the morphological\nreconstruction. A tight wavelet frame system is employed to decompose the\nobserved and filtered images so as to form their feature sets. Considering\nthese feature sets as data of clustering, an modified FCM algorithm is\nproposed, which introduces a KL divergence term in the partition matrix into\nits objective function. The KL divergence term aims to make membership degrees\nof each image pixel closer to those of its neighbors, which brings that the\nmembership partition becomes more suitable and the parameter setting of FCM\nbecomes simplified. On the basis of the obtained partition matrix and\nprototypes, the segmented feature set is reconstructed by minimizing the\ninverse process of the modified objective function. To modify abnormal features\nproduced in the reconstruction process, each reconstructed feature is\nreassigned to the closest prototype. As a result, the segmentation accuracy of\nKL divergence-based FCM is further improved. What's more, the segmented image\nis reconstructed by using a tight wavelet frame reconstruction operation.\nFinally, supporting experiments coping with synthetic, medical and color images\nare reported. Experimental results exhibit that the proposed algorithm works\nwell and comes with better segmentation performance than other comparative\nalgorithms. Moreover, the proposed algorithm requires less time than most of\nthe FCM-related algorithms.",

Our method allows the user to define structures of interest by\ninteractively marking a subset of pixels. Thanks to the real-time feedback, the\nuser can place new markings strategically, depending on the current outcome.\nThe final pixel classification may be obtained from a very modest user input.\nAn important ingredient of our method is a graph that encodes image content.\nThis graph is built in an unsupervised manner during initialisation and is\nbased on clustering of image features.

A further\nchoice of a convenient criterion for comparing measurements and calculations,\nits calculation and averaging within each sample and then over all samples,\nmakes it possible to choose the best theoretical model in the entire\nmeasurement area. Published theoretical data of the three-fluid dynamic model\n(3FD) applied to the experimental data from heavy-ion collisions at the energy\nrange $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\,=\\,2.7 - 63$ GeV are used as example of application of\nthe developed methodology. When analyzing the results, the quantum nature of\nthe fireball, created at heavy ion collisions, was taken into account. Thus,\neven at energy $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\,=\\,63$ GeV of central collisions of heavy ions,\nthere is a nonzero probability of fireball formation without ignition of the\nquark-gluon plasma (QGP). At the same time, QGP ignition at central collision\nenergies above at least $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\,=\\,12 GeV occurs through two competing\nprocesses, through a first-order phase transition and through a smooth\ncrossover. That is, in nature, these two possibilities are realized, which\noccur with approximately the same probabilities.\n",
    "Rapid growth in the field of quantitative digital image analysis is paving\nthe way for researchers to make precise measurements about objects in an image.\nTo compute quantities from the image such as the density of compressed\nmaterials or the velocity of a shockwave, we must determine object boundaries.\nImages containing regions that each have a spatial trend in intensity are of\nparticular interest. We present a supervised image segmentation method that\nincorporates spatial information to locate boundaries between regions with\noverlapping intensity histograms. The segmentation of a pixel is determined by\ncomparing its intensity to distributions from local, nearby pixel intensities.\nBecause of the statistical nature of the algorithm, we use maximum likelihood\nestimation theory to quantify uncertainty about each boundary. We demonstrate\nthe success of this algorithm on a radiograph of a multicomponent cylinder and\non an optical image of a laser-induced shockwave, and we provide final boundary\nlocations with associated bands of uncertainty.",
    "  The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we study eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of a bond percolation graph when the base\ngraph is finite and well approximated locally by an infinite regular graph. We\nrelate quantitatively the empirical measure of the eigenvalues and the\ndelocalization of the eigenvectors to the spectrum of the adjacency operator of\nthe percolation on the infinite graph. Secondly, we prove that percolation on\nan infinite regular tree with degree at least $3$ preserves the existence of an\nabsolutely continuous spectrum if the removal probability is small enough.\nThese two results are notably relevant for bond percolation on a uniformly\nsampled regular graph or a Cayley graph with large girth.\n",
    "The ability of neural networks to continuously learn and adapt to new tasks\nwhile retaining prior knowledge is crucial for many applications. However,\ncurrent neural networks tend to forget previously learned tasks when trained on\nnew ones, i.e., they suffer from Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). The objective of\nContinual Learning (CL) is to alleviate this problem, which is particularly\nrelevant for medical applications, where it may not be feasible to store and\naccess previously used sensitive patient data. In this work, we propose a\nContinual Learning approach for brain segmentation, where a single network is\nconsecutively trained on samples from different domains. We build upon an\nimportance driven approach and adapt it for medical image segmentation.\nParticularly, we introduce learning rate regularization to prevent the loss of\nthe network's knowledge. Our results demonstrate that directly restricting the\nadaptation of important network parameters clearly reduces Catastrophic\nForgetting for segmentation across domains.",
    "Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is the state-of-the-art method for\nimage segmentation, which is one of key challenging computer vision tasks.\nHowever, DCNN requires a lot of training images with corresponding image masks\nto get a good segmentation result.

    "Deep learning-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have led to\npromising results in medical images segmentation and can alleviate doctors'\nexpensive annotations by leveraging unlabeled data. However, most of the\nexisting SSL algorithms in literature tend to regularize the model training by\nperturbing networks and/or data. Observing that multi/dual-task learning\nattends to various levels of information which have inherent prediction\nperturbation, we ask the question in this work: can we explicitly build\ntask-level regularization rather than implicitly constructing networks- and/or\ndata-level perturbation-and-transformation for SSL? To answer this question, we\npropose a novel dual-task-consistency semi-supervised framework for the first\ntime. Concretely, we use a dual-task deep network that jointly predicts a\npixel-wise segmentation map and a geometry-aware level set representation of\nthe target. The level set representation is converted to an approximated\nsegmentation map through a differentiable task transform layer. Simultaneously,\nwe introduce a dual-task consistency regularization between the level\nset-derived segmentation maps and directly predicted segmentation maps for both\nlabeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show\nthat our method can largely improve the performance by incorporating the\nunlabeled data.

    "Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) has been applied to automatically\nsearch high-performance networks for medical image segmentation. The NAS search\nspace usually contains a network topology level (controlling connections among\ncells with different spatial scales) and a cell level (operations within each\ncell). Existing methods either require long searching time for large-scale 3D\nimage datasets, or are limited to pre-defined topologies (such as U-shaped or\nsingle-path). In this work, we focus on three important aspects of NAS in 3D\nmedical image segmentation: flexible multi-path network topology, high search\nefficiency, and budgeted GPU memory usage. A novel differentiable search\nframework is proposed to support fast gradient-based search within a highly\nflexible network topology search space. The discretization of the searched\noptimal continuous model in differentiable scheme may produce a sub-optimal\nfinal discrete model (discretization gap).

The findings of this study contribute to the field of texture segmentation and provide a valuable tool for image analysis and computer vision applications.",
    "This paper presents a novel approach for 3D semi-supervised learning using uncertainty-aware multi-view co-training.

    "This paper introduces a flexible regularization approach for mixture models and applies it to image segmentation. Mixture models are widely used in various fields, including image processing and computer vision. However, existing methods often assume fixed regularization parameters, which may not be optimal for different applications or data sets. To address this, we propose a regularization framework that allows the parameters to vary and adapt to the specific characteristics of the data. In particular, we use the Bayesian framework with a mixture of Gaussians model, and introduce flexible regularization terms to automatically determine the level of regularization for each component. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image segmentation tasks, where accurate delineation of objects and boundaries is crucial.

    "Algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods have been widely used to solve linear systems arising in particle methods. However, most of the existing literature focuses on symmetric matrices. In this paper, we investigate the performance of AMG methods for non-symmetric matrices arising in particle methods. Specifically, we consider two types of non-symmetric matrices: those corresponding to the connections between particles in physical space and those corresponding to the connections between particles in parameter space. We compare the performance of two popular AMG methods, namely smoothed aggregation (SA) and algebraic multigrid (AMG), on a set of test problems. Our results show that SA outperforms AMG for both types of non-symmetric matrices, highlighting the importance of considering non-symmetric matrices in the design of AMG methods for particle methods.

The CSCSE method combines the spatial and channel squeeze & excitation operations, which are commonly used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to enhance the representation power of FCNs. The spatial squeeze & excitation operation captures the spatial dependencies within feature maps, while the channel squeeze & excitation operation captures the channel-wise dependencies. By concurrently applying both operations, the CSCSE method effectively captures both spatial and channel-wise dependencies, leading to improved feature representation and better performance in various computer vision tasks. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CSCSE method in improving the performance of FCNs compared to existing methods.",

    " Recent results on data-efficient machine learning have shone a spotlight on the “data starvation” problem facing many important machine learning applications such as biodiversity monitoring, medical imaging, and fraud detection — there are not enough labeled examples to train a meaningful model. In this paper, we explore the problem of creating labeled datasets using generative models. We propose DatasetGAN, a methodology that uses a generative model to create a dataset of synthetic data instances and uses a discriminative model to distinguish the synthetic data instances from real data instances. The generative model is trained based on feedback from a user regarding the realism of the synthetic data instances, whereas the discriminative model is trained to classify instances as either real or synthetic. We show that, used iteratively, this methodology can create high-quality labeled datasets with as little as 10% of the labeled data usually required. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on a variety of datasets including figure drawings, wildlife images, and satellite images of electrical power lines and show that our approach reduces the amount of labeled data needed to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST benchmark by a factor of 20, and state-of-the-art performance on the EMNIST benchmark by a factor of 10.",
    " Many state-of-the-art segmentation models exploit domain-specific information for better performance but rely on either 1) assuming the availability of domain-specific segmentation models or 2) using heuristic normalization schemes that do not perform well when the distribution of the data is complex. In this paper, we aim to address both of these issues. We propose a realistic image normalization (RIN) approach towards learning a single segmentation model that is able to adapt to multiple domains while maintaining performance. Our approach first estimates the domain-specificity in the image and then compensates for it by adjusting the image pixel-wise so that the distribution becomes more uniform. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three publicly available datasets, and show the advantages against prior art on both segmented and unsegmented images.",
    " An image segmentation method is proposed in this paper, which is based on a combined approach of fuzzy classification and contextual region growing. First, to obtain the initial segments, the image is partitioned into several regions by using a fuzzy classification method. In order to obtain appropriate parameters for the fuzzy classification, we propose to select the appropriate fuzzy rules by using a genetic algorithm. Then, in order to obtain the final segments, the regions obtained by the fuzzy classification are merged into larger segments by using a contextual region growing method, where the merging is based on the similarity between the regions and the gradient of the image. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the database of UTK-IMDB is used, which is a standard database for benchmarking image segmentation methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in segmenting medical images.",
    " We present a cross-modal self-attention network (CMSAN) for referring image segmentation. Given a referring expression, our goal is to assign segment labels to each pixel in the corresponding image region. To this end, we propose to use a self-attention mechanism to capture the relationships between referring expressions and image regions, as well as the relationships between the image regions themselves. Specifically, we generate region queries and phrase queries to represent the image regions and referring expressions, respectively. Then, we apply self-attention to compute the weights of the region queries and phrase queries, which indicate the relevance between each region and each phrase. Finally, we use the weighted region queries and phrase queries to predict the segment labels for the image regions. To handle the long-tail problem in referring expressions, we propose to use a progressive attention mechanism, which gradually attends to the long-tail phrases. In addition, to overcome the data imbalance between referring expressions and image regions, we introduce a cross-modal sampling strategy to balance the training samples. Our experimental results on the ReferItSeg dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.",
    " Semantic image segmentation, as a fundamental task in computer vision, aims at assigning semantic labels to each pixel in an image. Recently, deep learning methods have shown promising results in this area. However, most existing methods rely on greedy inference, which can result in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for semantic image segmentation based on Deep Gaussian CRFs (DGCRFs), which are a class of probabilistic models that leverage deep features learned by convolutional neural networks. By formulating the segmentation problem as a probabilistic inference problem, our approach is able to produce more accurate and robust predictions. We introduce a fast and exact inference algorithm that scales to realistic images. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale inference scheme that further improves the segmentation quality by exploiting the hierarchical structure of the DGCRFs.

    " Recent works in contrastive learning based on triplet networks achieve remarkable performance in image semantic segmentation. However, they rely on significant amounts of labeled data and fail to adapt to new classes not present in the training set. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to improve the performance of triplet networks. Our solution is to use attention maps to weigh the supervised signal. We show that our approach significantly improves performance on semantic segmentation, reducing the error by up to 7% over the state-of-the-art on the VOC2012 dataset, while using less labeled data. We present an easy-to-train end-to-end system that is able to learn a meaningful attention map in a self-supervised manner. When combined with triplet networks, our approach is able to preserve the known benefits of that architecture while using fewer labeled images.",
    " We introduce a new computational paradigm for belief propagation. This new paradigm, which we call Sigma Point Belief Propagation (SPBP), is based on the Monte Carlo approximation of the partition function, analogously to the way in which the quantum partition function is replaced by its classical Monte Carlo analog in Quantum Monte Carlo methods. In SPBP, particles propagate through the graph, summing the log-likelihoods of the variable nodes they visit. The particles also carry a weight which is proportional to the number of visits, and decay over time. These properties enable SPBP to compute the belief propagation iterates in a distributed manner, where particles are propagated through the graph by the variable nodes, and the factor nodes merely weigh and sum the particles. In experiments on synthetic datasets, we show that SPBP can yield an order of magnitude speedup over standard belief propagation, with a relatively small increase in the error.",
    " Recent progress in sketch colorization is primarily focused on accurate color prediction and lacks consideration of semantic segmentation. We propose a new loss function for sketch colorization that combines adversarial loss with segmentation loss, which can improve the colorization results and maintain the localization of the color. The segmentation loss is proposed to enforce the correspondence between the predicted color and the labeled segment map by introducing a threshold on the gradient of the segmentation metric. In addition, we introduce a new loss function for sketch colorization, termed as the adversarial segmentation loss, which combines adversarial loss with the proposed segmentation loss. The adversarial loss can enhance the colorization results by encouraging the predicted color to be more realistic, while the segmentation loss can improve the localization of the color. The proposed method has been evaluated on the public sketch-colorization dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches.",
    " We study the Cauchy problem for elliptic complexes in the space of distributions. We show that the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Cauchy problem imply the completeness of the corresponding initial data. This result is applied to the Cauchy problem for elliptic complexes associated to a complex Monge-Ampere equation in the space of distributions.\n\n## Implicit function theorem and the Cauchy problem for elliptic complexes \n\nLet $\\mathcal{E}$ be a complex of elliptic operators on a smooth manifold $X$. The Cauchy problem for $\\mathcal{E}$ consists in finding a function $u\\in C^\\infty(X)$ such that $u\\restriction_{\\partial X} =f$ and $\\mathcal{E}(u) = 0$ on $X$, where $f$ is a given data on $\\partial X$. If $\\mathcal{E}$ is a complex of pseudodifferential operators, the Cauchy problem has been widely studied using various approaches (see [^1] for instance). In all these cases, the methods rely on the possibility of defining the involved operators as distributions, that is, as linear maps from the space of smooth functions to the space of smooth functions equipped with the $C^\\infty$-topology. However, it is well known that the definition of the involved operators in the distribution space does not always yield a meaningful definition for the elliptic complex $\\mathcal{E}$. Indeed, in general, there is no reason why the differential operator $\\mathcal{E}$ should be continuous as a map from the space of smooth functions to the space of distributions. Therefore, one cannot expect to apply classical methods to solve the Cauchy problem for $\\mathcal{E}$ in the space of distributions.\n\n## An explicit regularizing property and the completeness of initial data \n\nIn this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for an elliptic complex $\\mathcal{E}$ in the distribution space. We show that the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Cauchy problem imply the completeness of the corresponding initial data $f$, provided that $f$ is in the range of $\\mathcal{E}$. To prove this result, we use an explicit regularizing property of the elliptic complex $\\mathcal{E}$, which enables us to define a map from the space of smooth functions to itself, that is,",
    " Deep learning segmentation networks for rectal cancer microscopy images often show strong model variance, which hampers generalization performance. We attribute this to the limited amount of training data available, which leads to overfitting. To mitigate this problem, we propose a simple yet effective approach to reduce the model variance of a segmentation network. Our approach consists of training the network with data augmentation on a larger dataset, and then fine-tuning the network on the target dataset with a lower amount of labeled data. We compare our method to other approaches for model variance reduction, such as training on a larger dataset without data augmentation, and model selection using validation performance. Our results show that our method improves the mean Dice similarity coefficient by 5.2% compared to training on the full dataset without data augmentation, and by 3.2% compared to model selection using validation performance. Furthermore, it reduces the maximum Dice coefficient variation among five different runs by 40.7%.",
    " We present a new architecture for robust semantic segmentation based on superpixels derived from a clustering of pixels. Superpixels provide an initial grouping of pixels that captures local structure, such that each superpixel can be treated as a single object. We propose a novel approach to incorporate this prior knowledge of object locations by learning a superpixel convolutional network (SCN) that directly operates on superpixel inputs. Our approach leverages the recently introduced Inception architecture for efficient computation of multi-scale information. We show that Inception features extracted from superpixels provide good performance on semantic segmentation, and we analyze types of information that are missed when going from pixels to superpixels. We then propose a modification of the classical bilateral filter that is applied to the raw pixel data prior to running our SCN. This modification adaptively enhances the information content of each pixel, providing a form of pixel-level attention. We show that this attention mechanism improves performance in semantic segmentation, probably by making our SCN more robust to the loss of information during the superpixel clustering step. Our approach achieves 75.8% mean accuracy on the CamVid dataset, a new record on this dataset, and 79.4% mean accuracy on the Stanford Background dataset.",

We find that the best models still fail at detecting synapses in EM images, but with a significant improvement over previous works. Furthermore, we show the possibility of creating new effective models using only a small number of training examples. Finally, we use the winning models to provide a quantitative characterization, for the first time, of the full heterogeneity of synapses in a large brain region, thereby paving the way to a full understanding of the complexity of brain connectivity.",
    " Patterns are ubiquitous in natural language texts, formal languages, and biological sequences. Furthermore, patterns can often be embedded within one another forming hierarchical structures. For example, in a natural language sentence, individual words can form phrases, and phrases can form clauses, etc. Similarly, in genetic sequences, motifs (short patterns) can form larger structures such as genes, which in turn form chromosomes. These hierarchical structures can be represented as nodes in a tree, where each node has potentially multiple parent nodes and multiple child nodes. Such tree structures are referred to as tree patterns.\n\nThis paper addresses the problem of finding tree patterns with avoidance, where avoidance refers to the absence of a pattern from certain nodes in the tree. We formalize the problem as a pattern avoidance problem in a task-precedence poset, and present a general algorithm that takes advantage of the hierarchical structure of trees. The algorithm is based on dynamic programming, and employs a novel, general purpose, bottom-up, disaggregated recurrence, which we term fold-back. This fold-back operator allows us to decompose the avoidance problem into a set of simpler problems, and to solve these problems in a bottom-up manner.\n\nWe implement our algorithm, and run experiments on a standard benchmark. Our experiments show that our algorithm often outperforms the current state of the art in tree pattern avoidance, and is competitive with the best known algorithms for tree pattern matching, thus establishing pattern avoidance in trees as a new and challenging problem.",
    " Recent works have shown that the choice of evaluation metric can impact the performance of a model; however, in most cases, a single metric is used for model training. In many applications, such as natural language understanding, it is difficult to define a single metric that captures the quality of a model's output. Instead, multiple metrics may be used, each capturing different aspects of the model's behavior. Unfortunately, training a model to maximize all metrics simultaneously is an ill-defined problem, as any optimization algorithm needs an objective function for convergence, and having multiple metrics defined only as constraints can be challenging and may result in unsatisfactory solutions. In this work, we propose a framework where a single model is trained to optimize each metric separately, while still learning useful representations that help the model perform well on other metrics as well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of tasks, including natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and question answering, showing that our approach finds representations that are shared across different metrics, and outperforms models trained with a single metric.",

    " Recent progresses in MRI acquisition techniques have led to an explosion of big imaging data, posing a tremendous challenge for expert manual segmentation. Meanwhile, compared with the abundant labeled images from different domains, the few-shot segmentation setting, where only a few images of specific domains are available for training, is more practical in real-world applications. In this work, we exploit the intrinsic hierarchical structure of segmenting brain MR images from different domains with a deep heteroscedastic multi-task learning (HMT) framework. Specifically, we design a weighted cross-entropy loss to incorporate the heteroscedastic noise of unlabeled data from different domains in an automatic manner. Furthermore, to effectively utilize the limited labeled data, we propose a knowledge distillation strategy that explicitly trains a thinner student network with the learned knowledge from a thicker teacher network pre-trained on abundant data. When trained on a few-shot setting, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for brain MRI segmentation on multiple public datasets, including ISLES, LLC and ADNI. The code is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Few-shot-brain-segmentation.",
    " Recent results on salient object detection take a top-down approach, in which the model first detects the foreground and then refines it to obtain the final salient regions. Most existing works focus on designing effective refinement modules to improve the quality of the predicted saliency maps. In this work, we argue that a key problem of current top-down methods is the quality of the initial foreground map, which is usually obtained by thresholding or clamping the output of an encoder. To address this problem, we propose a classifier-guided approach that refines the initial foreground map with a classifier. Specifically, we train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with image-level labels to predict whether a pixel is in the foreground or not. Since the classifier is trained with image-level labels, it is able to exploit global information and capture the underlying object-like structures. Extensive experiments on the salient object detection benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

    " Current image segmentation techniques are usually designed to segment images of a specific modality, such as natural images or medical images.

Our model, called HeMIS, is based on a modification of the U-Net architecture that allows it to handle images of different modalities without the need for retraining. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two different datasets, one for natural images and one for medical images. Our results show that HeMIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets without the need for any modification to the model.",

DGMP introduces a novel pyramid grouping module (PGM) to effectively group and convey multi-scale contextual information, and a joint parsing and refining network (JPRN) to jointly parse and refine the predicted results. Specifically, PGM can automatically group the interested regions and refine the grouped features within a single network architecture, which achieves multiple grouping behaviors with only one forward pass. Furthermore, our JPRN can not only parse the whole image but also refine the predicted results, which further improves the performance. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, DGMP can achieve better performance with a faster inference speed.",

    " We study the existence of an asymptotic upper bound on the clique-width of graphs in an arbitrary minimal class of graphs defined by a finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs. We show that if the minimal class is recursively enumerable, then it possesses an asymptotic upper bound on the clique-width, but that none of the currently known upper bounds on the clique-width of graphs is maximal for any minimal class. We also show that the family of graphs of bounded clique-width and the family of graphs of unbounded clique-width each have a maximal subclass of recursively enumerable graphs that possesses an asymptotic upper bound on the clique-width, which is not always the case for general classes of graphs.",
    " Recent works have shown that deep learning models can be robustly attacked via adversarial patches. Such patches are typically crafted manually by humans, which limits their scalability and applicability in real-world attack scenarios. In this work, we automate the patch generation process via a genetic algorithm, which searches for the best patch in an image collection. To avoid the need for an initial collection of patches, we propose a data generation process that uses a patched model to generate in-distribution patch candidates. We implement our approach in the iPatch tool, and show that it can successfully find patches achieving high attack success rates and transfer well to models from other architectures. We evaluate iPatch on ImageNet classifier models as well as popular NLP transformer models, and demonstrate the necessity of patch protection for NLP tasks.",

    " We present stellar population models for the disks of 26 nearby S0 galaxies, based on deep, spatially resolved spectroscopy from Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys observations as part of the SAURON project. We derive the scale lengths of the stellar disks for the S0s, and find them to be uniformly thin, with a characteristic scale length of 4.2 ± 1.4 kiloparsecs. This is similar to the scale length of the Milky Way's stellar disk, but much thinner than the scale lengths typically measured for late-type galaxies. The low dispersion of the scale lengths suggests that the thinning is an evolutionary effect, common to galaxies at the mature stage of their lives. The surface brightness profiles of the stellar disks are well fit by a single exponential profile, except for the central regions, which display a plateau, likely caused by stellar disks whose ages are decreasing inward. The mass density profile ρ(r) of the stellar mass in the galaxies can be fit well by a double exponential profile with a transition radius of about 1.3 disk scale lengths, similar to the transition radius found in the Milky Way. This supports the hypothesis that the stellar mass profiles of S0 galaxies are built up in a similar manner to those of spirals. We determine the orbital velocities and dynamical masses for the S0s, and use these to calculate the projected phase space densities π_∣3¯¹ for the galaxies. The majority of the S0s have π_∣3¯¹≲1, indicating that these galaxies are not dominated by random motion, as would be expected if most of their stellar mass was contained in a diffuse, dynamically hot halo. However, non-negligible contributions to π_∣3¯¹ from the stars in the thin disks, which are dynamically cold, can produce this result. This suggests that the stellar halos of S0s may be much less massive than those of spirals.",
    " Description logic is a widely used formalism for the definition of ontologies. A description logic ontology consists of a set of logical axioms, which define concepts and the relationships between them. These axioms are usually defined in a hierarchical way, with more general concepts being defined first, and more specific concepts being defined in terms of more general ones. This hierarchical structure can be viewed as a tree-like structure, with the most general concepts being the root of the tree, and the more specific concepts being the leaves of the tree.\n\nThe complexity of a description logic ontology is determined by the number of concepts and relationships between them, and the way in which they are defined. A more complex ontology will have more concepts and relationships, and more complex definitions of these concepts and relationships. The complexity of an ontology can also be affected by the structure of the hierarchy of concepts and relationships, as a more complex hierarchy will result in a more complex ontology.\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the data complexity of description logic ontologies, that is, the amount of data that is required to represent an ontology, and the complexity of this data in terms of the number of concepts and relationships, and the way in which they are defined. We show that the data complexity of an ontology is related to the structure of the hierarchy of concepts and relationships, and that a more complex hierarchy will result in a more complex ontology in terms of data complexity. We also show that the data complexity of an ontology can be reduced by using a more efficient representation of the hierarchy of concepts and relationships, such as a nested set representation.",
    " Recent progress in deep learning has advanced referring expression comprehension, i.e., the understanding of sparse referring expressions that refer to objects or regions in images or videos, from image regions identification to pixel-wise segmentation. However, existing works mainly focus on 2D referring expression comprehension disregarding the inherent 3D structure of the real world. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multi-modal framework to tackle referring image segmentation, which takes advantages of both referring expressions and geometric constraints, to achieve referring expression comprehension with 3D awareness. Specifically, we first devise a new geometric constraint that leverages the 3D scene structure to obtain initial segmentations. Then, we formulate referring expression comprehension as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem that integrates the referring expression predictions and the geometric constraint. Furthermore, we explore a progressive refinement approach to iteratively refine the segmentation results. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the ReferItSeg dataset, which is a large-scale dataset for referring image segmentation, and achieve state-of-the-art performance.",

    " We introduce a new weakly-supervised segmentation framework that leverages geodesic inter-extreme points (GEIX) for object instance segmentation. Our approach extends the traditional geodesic ellipsoids to a new class of shapes that capture the relationships among multiple objects.

We show that the resulting optimization is efficiently solved as a linear programming (LP) problem on certain parametrization of the geodesic inter-extreme variations. In addition, to effectively solve the LP problem, we propose an algorithm that iteratively updates the shapes by performing a series of convex optimizations.

Scale-space filtering is a framework that is less sensitive to scale-dependent features and noise. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework for scale-space filtering, called Hierarchical Image Peeling (HIP), which adapts to the image structure at multiple scales. HIP uses a top-down approach where it first identifies the regions of interest in an image (using a segmentation mask) and then recursively peels the image from these regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on smoothing and edge-preserving filters, showing improvements over state-of-the-art scale-space methods.\n\nWould you like to know more about this paper?",

    "An abstract is a summary of a academic paper.\nAbstract:\nTo render realistic images, computer graphics algorithms must be able to distinguish and render a variety of materials. Although deep learning has achieved remarkable results in image-based material recognition, current datasets have limited size and diversity, containing only a small number of materials and lacking fine-grained annotations. We overcome these limitations by introducing a large-scale 4D light-field material recognition dataset with 1,826 fine-grained material labels and 25,326 images captured under diverse viewpoints, lighting conditions, and occlusions. We design a new deep neural network (DNN) architecture, FedNet, that directly utilizes the 4D light-field data for material recognition. Given a 4D light-field input, FedNet separately predicts material labels for each microlens image and merges the predictions to generate the final output. In addition, we propose a new 3D feature pooling strategy that effectively utilizes the spatial information in the 4D light-field input. Experiments show that FedNet achieves an accuracy of 89.4% on the fine-grained material recognition task, outperforming previous methods.

    "Abstract:\nDomain adaptation has gained increasing attention in recent years, where the goal is to adapt a model trained on one domain to perform well on a target domain. However, most existing methods focus on the scenario where the target domain has only one data source, which may limit their applicability in real-world scenarios where multiple data sources are available for the target domain. In this paper, we address the multi-source domain adaptation under target shift, where the target domain consists of multiple data sources, and a distribution shift exists between the shared source domain and each target source. We propose a new framework for multi-source domain adaptation under target shift based on optimal transport, which enables the domain adaptation of each target source to learn from both the shared source domain and other target sources. Our framework can effectively capture the distribution discrepancies among all domains and mitigate the target shift problem. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets for image classification, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "Abstract:\nImage segmentation is a fundamental task in medical imaging and has been actively researched for decades. In recent years, deep learning models have shown promising results in image segmentation. However, a significant number of medical images available in the real world are labeled partially or not at all. These images are called semi-supervised or unsupervised images, respectively. Meanwhile, some images can be in multiple modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therefore, the image segmentation task should be performed under the semi-supervised and multimodal settings. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for image segmentation under the semi-supervised and multimodal settings. We disentangle the foreground and background of the image using a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture. Then, we align the features of different modalities using a shared encoder and fuse them into a single vector using a weights-learned fusion strategy. Finally, we segment the image by classifying the fused features using a conditional random field (CRF) classifier.

    "Abstract:\nLet $(X_i)_{i\\in {\\mathbb Z}}$ be independent and identically distributed random variables in $\\mathbb R$, with values in a probability group $(\\Omega,\\mathcal F,\\mathbb P)$. We consider their mixing properties and relation to the central limit theorem. In particular, we study the double recurrence of $X_0$ and show that it implies the convergence of the characteristic function of $X_0$ towards the characteristic function of a complex Gaussian distribution. Some applications of this result in the context of spatial statistics are given.",
    "An interactive object segmentation system aims to provide precise segmentation results for specific objects of interest in a natural image or video, regardless of whether the objects are known a priori or not. In this paper, we present an approach for interactive video object segmentation that operates on raw video data in the wild without requiring any a priori information. We exploit the temporal coherence in video to obtain robust and precise object segmentation results even in the presence of heavy occlusion, similar appearance, and complicated background. In our approach, the user interaction is limited to a minimal annotation of object regions at a few key frames, and the object regions are propagated through the video using a learned propagation model. The propagation model is trained to recognize the underlying structure of the video using a sparse set of object segmentations that are obtained by an initial run of our system. Our approach is capable of accurately segmenting objects of interest in an interactive manner, and is efficient in terms of computational performance and the required user effort. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide variety of videos including those with challenging scenes and complex objects.",
    "Abstract:\nSource-free domain adaptation is a challenging problem in image segmentation, as it involves training a model to segment images from a target domain without having access to any labeled source data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this problem by using a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (Cycle-GAN) to learn a mapping between the source and target domains. Our approach allows us to train a segmentation model on source data and then adapt it to the target domain without needing any labeled target data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three different domain adaptation scenarios, and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of segmentation accuracy.",
    "Abstract:\nWith the widespread use of online social networking platforms, the study of the underlying social graphs has gained significant importance. This paper specifically focuses on Twitter, one of the most popular social media platforms today, and empirically analyzes the evolution of its social graph. By employing graph theory, we aim to explore the inherent properties and dynamics of the Twitter social graph, including its connectivity, centrality, and community structure. Our experimental study involves collecting a substantial dataset of Twitter user interactions and applying various graph algorithms and measures. We find that the Twitter social graph exhibits distinct characteristics, such as high clustering and power-law degree distribution, indicating the presence of communities and influencers. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the graph exhibits evolving properties over time, indicating the dynamic nature of user interactions and the platform's evolution. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the Twitter social graph, which can aid in the development of more effective algorithms and applications for social network analysis and visualization.",
    "Medical image segmentation is prone to label corruption since the training and test domains differ. We propose a simple yet effective solution to address this domain shift issue via a cross-denoising network (CDN). Given a medical image, our proposed CDN estimates a clean label for each pixel and refines it through a denoising branch to reduce noise. To mitigate the domain shift issue, we propose a simple yet effective domain adaptation (DA) layer that aligns the distributions of source and target domains. Specifically, we estimate the source domain with only clean training labels and the target domain with only noisy labels. We then align the feature distributions of the source and target domains via maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and minimize the distance between them via domain adaptation. Experiments on three public medical image segmentation datasets with noisy labels (e.g., due to annotation errors or low-quality images) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against various types of noise. In particular, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves 9.92%, 6.73%, and 11.45% relative improvements in segmentation accuracy.",
    "Quantum causal models are models where the causal structure of the theory is described directly by the quantum state. This paper addresses two aspects of quantum causal models. The first is constructive: we give a general method of constructing causal models starting from a given prepolymer, extending previous work. The second aspect is concerned with the question of faithfulness. We prove a strong form of faithfulness, which to our knowledge has not been previously asserted nor even suggested in the literature: that any causal model which assigns probability 1 to a given outcome must be faithfully modelled by some quantum state. We also show that this implies, in a models-independent way, that non-faithful causal models can only assign probability 0 or 1 to an outcome, strengthening a previous result of Henson. We end with a discussion of the relationship between our work and the longstanding question of whether quantum mechanics allows for backward causation or retrocausality.",
    "Ballast degradation evaluation using image processing technique has gained attention in the recent past. This paper presents the Matlab implementation of a machine vision algorithm to conduct ballast degradation evaluation. The algorithm utilizes the Color Channel Combination (CCC) method to enhance the degradation level of ballast particles. The system was tested on a database of ballast images and the results were compared with the conventional manual method of degradation evaluation. The results showed that the machine vision algorithm can identify the degradation level of ballast particles with an accuracy of 92%. The algorithm can be used as a tool to assist railway engineers in conducting ballast degradation evaluation and optimizing ballast maintenance strategies.\n\nThe Matlab implementation of the machine vision algorithm for ballast degradation evaluation can be useful for railway engineers to assess the condition of ballast and optimize maintenance strategies. The algorithm can accurately identify the degree of degradation in ballast particles, providing valuable information for making informed decisions on ballast management. This technology can be applied in the field to analyze ballast images and assess the condition of the ballast in real-time, helping to maintain the integrity and performance of the railway system.",
    "Advocacy learning has demonstrated strong promise for many domains and we are rapidly becoming accustomed to applying this approach. However, few datasets have been studied experimentally with adversarial training such as the MNIST handwritten digit recognition task, which includes more than 500 million trials over almost two decades. Here, we propose an approach that allows generating ad-hoc networks through supervised, unconstrained sampling, enabling robust training even on data not suitable or appropriate for other methods. As in previous approaches (e.g., refs. 25⇓–27), our framework is based upon factorisation of the latent representations of discrete classes into more interpretable clusters by reducing their inter-class similarity; however, by adopting an extra layer between these hidden states, our generative model can represent high dimensional features efficiently without being trained in advance.\n\nThese ideas also appear in Nils Brauer's work, The Design (or Lack thereof) Of Learning From Imperfect Data; A Perspective On Support Vector Machines With Generalization Problems, but they're more developed here, with some really neat implementation examples at the end.

    "We present a new method of visualizing semantic relationships between visual features and language in scenes using semantic segmentation. Our system's high degree of generativity makes it a suitable candidate for visualizing complex relationships in a generative picture language.\n\nOur work is based primarily on the theory of visualizing the semantic relationships between features in scenes, inspired by the ideas in Büchner et al.'s Theories of Semantic Visualization thesis [1]. We consider the problem of visualizing semantic relationships between two visual features, such as an object and an object feature respectively. This approach is inspired by visualizing the semantic relationships between visual features in the natural world (see this paper for further details) when considering the relationships of two complex, spatially distributed sequences of features. In particular, we consider the problem of visualizing a semantic relationship between, for example, a location and a location feature (here, the features at two locations on the scene).\n\nFor example, consider two examples:\n\nA scene in which there are, in addition to the location feature, six features corresponding to motion direction.\n\nA non-artistic scene in which there are, in addition to the location feature, three features corresponding to time of day.\n\nWe are presented with a way to visualize relationships between these two situations with respect to the feature sequence of the non-artistic scene. For the purposes of illustration we are only interested in the question of whether there is a spatial relationship in the visual features of the two scenes.\n\nWe present general techniques we use to solve this problem, which in the future may be used effectively to perform similar tasks on scenes from diverse genres, different disciplines, and with different features, in different domains.\n\nOur results show that our method does produce a well-organized graph where the semantic relationships within a given image sequence is well preserved across different scenes. Moreover, our results show that the semantics of an image sequence can be visualized through a visual representation of its semantic relationships. This visualization technique provides a means for the visualization of semantic relationships between a visual feature in a scene. When visualized, the semantic relationships can be compared visually to visual features from different, different domains, such as music visualizations, or even a 3D scene rendered from various types of data.\n\nThe Semantic",

    "We present an algorithm that can be used to derive the C-W equivalence between two sets of points, given their coordinates and distances. The algorithm is based on the fact that the distance between any pair of points in Euclidean space is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances between them. We show that this result holds even if we assume that the set of points has no boundary. This implies that the C-W equivalence is equivalent to the Euclidean equivalence. In particular, it follows that the C-W equivalence is equivalent to the Euclidean equivalence when the distance between two points is less than or equal to the square root of 2.",
    "Our paper deals with the problems that arise when you have to write the equation in algebraic notation. The obvious solution to the equation is to use an approximate interpolation, but those methods can be computationally expensive, if not prohibitively so for small data sets. There's also another problem, which is much more prevalent: You have to rewrite it every time. This is called 'chebyverification', and while it isn't as common as other problems of this nature (e.g., rewriting every time using brute force), it can still be disastrous. To see why it happens so frequently (and worse than before by over 5X), we will present some examples, show how they arise naturally with various analytic choices, and illustrate where optimization strategies might be developed to avoid them.

    "Non-Measurable Unions in the Presence of Arbitrary Nonlinearity\n\nIn this work, we study the effect of arbitrary nonlinearity on the behavior of non-measurable unions. We show that if one has an arbitrary nonlinearity, then the union of two sets of elements can be described by a linear combination of these sets. This means that the union of two sets of elements can be described as a sum of linear combinations of their components. In other words, the union of two sets of elements can be described as a linear combination of their component sums. The existence of such a linear combination implies that there exists a set of all possible linear combinations of the union of two sets of elements. If one has an arbitrary nonlinearity, then it follows that the union of two sets of elements cannot be described by any linear combination of its components. Thus, the union of two sets of elements cannot be described as a linear combination of their component sums.\n\nWe prove that the above statement holds even when the union of two sets of elements is not commutative and that the above statement holds even when the union of two sets of elements is not associative.\n\nThis work was done with the help of the following resources:",

    "In this work we investigate the use of high dimensional sparse filters for image filtering, focusing on the problem of image filtering with noisy data and limited capacity. We show how to apply this filtering method to a range of applications in image processing, particularly deep learning, by building a scalable BNF-like model that can adaptively learn to deal with the noisy data, and by employing the high-dimensional sparse linear algebra to efficiently scale up image filtering. Our model learns to handle arbitrary sparsely shaped data efficiently, using a high dimensional non-linearity in the input space and high dimensional non-linearity in the output space. The result is efficient implementation of simple filtering algorithms and a complete characterization of the framework's performance. In particular, we show for a range of image datasets, both for both real and n-dimensional sparse data, that training is achievable through a combination of parallel filtering and parallel sparse linear algebra. Our results also show that this system can be extended to handle large datasets, without requiring additional feature engineering.\n\nWe demonstrate two main results. First, we make use of the scaling technique proposed in this article, to achieve efficient scaling of high-dimensional sparse linear algebra representations on a GPU.

    "This paper presents the implementation of the adversarial constraint-based CNN with a large vocabulary. In contrast with previous efforts we employ fully connected components, which allows us to achieve better performance under unsupervised, multi-label classification tasks. All of our classes are implemented in the fully connected layer based on the adversarial constraint-based training framework proposed in [Sharma19][Keen21]. However, unlike traditional adversarial training, the CNN is trained directly and never participates in the learning process. We demonstrate significant improvement in classification accuracy in the unsupervised task in two different images of the same patient based only on the original CNN structure and using a large natural vocabulary. Using the adversarial structure, each CNN class is trained with different weights, and the resulting loss of each type of CNN is computed. Our approach achieves robustness and speed in comparison with the traditional approach.\n\nThis is definitely a big first step in the AI space here, and while they say this will be implemented in a medical imaging application, you could easily run the same approach on any subject, especially in the domain of medical imaging, which needs some type of classification to distinguish between healthy and sick people. From where we are standing, we can't tell you exactly how that will play out in the real world, but we're not exactly betting against it having some serious, positive effects.\n\n[image credit: iStock]",

    "High-dimensional estimating equations (HEDE) have broad applications, in the domains of biomedical drug discovery, biophysical dynamics, and environmental economics. The generalization techniques that have allowed us to create high-dimensional HEDE models are not very useful, at least in practice. To gain a practical insight on the difficulties we have encountered in doing so, we present a numerical example of the process we have been describing, along with two variants (with different numbers of dimension) where it is not possible to solve the equations. We also present a proof of the completeness of the technique. Our analysis focuses on the case where an arbitrary data set can be represented as a sum of \"subspaces\" containing \"values,\" and are not constrained to have certain properties. We propose a more general strategy to estimate models, to be used with higher-dimensional data sets that have at least the dimension that is needed. We show that with such data, we can model many important phenomena in physics and biology, notably biological macromolecular interactions, electrochemical and molecular dissociation, and non-equilibrium electron transfer processes. While a certain amount of computational effort is necessary in the case of simple models without constraints on the size of the spatial dimensions of the model, our approach is well suited for models with arbitrary spatial dimensions.\n\nThe full paper has been published in Nature Communications: \"Hierarchical and Multidimensional Estimating Equations for Physical Models with High Dimensionality.\"\n\nI've always been a huge fan of the idea of \"higher order approximations\" – in particular, the idea that we can use higher level approximations and use them to do things we could not do before.

    "Abstract The distorted mirror of Wikipedia (DM) has been widely discussed in academic circles, and its impact on scholarly communication has been studied by several researchers. This study examines the extent to which Wikipedia articles about academics are biased against them. We find that DM articles tend to be more negative than those about other fields, but this effect is not significant when we control for the number of citations to these articles. In addition, we show that the bias is driven by the fact that Wikipedia articles about academics have fewer references to their work than do articles about other disciplines. These results suggest that Wikipedia's focus on the humanities may lead it to produce an overly positive view of academia.\nThis is a very interesting study. I think it does a good job of showing how Wikipedia can skew the way people perceive certain topics. It also shows that there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of how Wikipedia presents information about academics. For example, if you look at the article on the University of California system, it says that UC Berkeley is one of the top ten universities in the world, yet it doesn't mention that they're ranked #1 in the US. That would be a much better representation of what the university actually is.\nI'm sure there will be some who say that this isn't really relevant because Wikipedia is just a collection of random links to other websites. But I don't see how that could possibly be true. If Wikipedia was just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why did it take so long for someone to notice that it had a problem? And if Wikipedia were just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why didn't anyone notice that it was being edited by a group of editors with a clear agenda?\nIf Wikipedia is just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why did it take so long for someone to notice that it had a problem?\nAnd if Wikipedia is just a bunch of random links to other websites, then why did it take so long for someone to notice that it was being edited by a group of editors with a clear agenda?\nIt seems like a pretty big deal that Wikipedia is being used as a source of information about academics.

    "Abstract While much has been written about prompt generation for DEL, it remains highly problematic to reliably produce the output given many different environment parameters - some difficult and others obvious like an ENV variable's value and configuration of.NET's eventing infrastructure. The primary problem can be summarized as follows: To obtain reliable and predictable outputs from simple, dynamic input, a generator should be composed to use standard environment variables where possible and otherwise invoke built in function such as shell commands or batch file parsing that does not rely on the current environment. In addition to being less error prone because one does not need to make hard assumptions on the input, this design methodology reduces reliance on libraries (such as CSPRNGs ) which are susceptible to changes during runtime in order to exploit specific inputs within the program. However this approach still requires careful manual effort to ensure no data gets accidentally overwritten because any number of errors can result when entering unknown variables while running DEVELOPER'S CHILD with some kind of custom logic involving INPUT's,.NET's Eventing Frameworks, etc.\nWhile there are multiple approaches to dynamically create these environments (often named \"Del\", \"DELIMEPLATIONER \", \"dynamic prompt generation \" or even just DEL_SEARCH_DEPL) they invariably fall short due to the necessity (at least in my experience) of ensuring most of the initial input contains a string like /bin/bash in its name. This makes them extremely resource intensive, expensive in terms of CPU usage, require having an entire interpreter to run on your computer and, as a side effect, limits their flexibility due to the fact that most people have limited familiarity with how languages work internally until they actually need to interact with those languages to generate an environment out of input. Since I'm looking at the topic as a programmer who is very concerned with maintaining his programming language knowledge through active practice so while these features may get new features added quickly into existing programming environments they won't necessarily change something that is fundamental to what I take pride in when using an existing programming language. While most of us will probably never see that feature enabled by default within our editors, IDEs or other programs we often do need to enter inputs that start with bash ; or command line arguments that start with \\; etc. But how often do we encounter prompts from",

We present a statistical model that quantifies the contribution of dental biofilms to oral health by using a novel approach based on the analysis of data from a large cohort of patients with periodontal diseases. Our results show that dental biofilms contribute significantly to the development of periodontitis, whereas they do not affect the severity or persistence of gum disease. The model also shows that the presence of dental biofilms does not predict the risk of developing periodontitis. These findings suggest that dental biofilms may be useful as biomarkers for the assessment of periodontal disease, but further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

    "\"In this paper, we present a new approach for facial landmark detection, based on deep learning, that combines multiple deep neural networks into a single super-trained system for facial landmark recognition. Our system can learn to extract landmarks from any object feature image, including ones that are not directly visible, or for example when a human's face is obscured by an object. We present extensive analyses showing that our algorithm can accurately predict facial landmark attributes in the absence of extensive landmark knowledge, and also demonstrate its ability to converge on a human-recognized human face. Our data set is enriched with a relatively large number of human faces that are well known to both computer vision researchers and general users, which makes our task interesting for both researchers and users.\n\nThe current state of facial recognition technologies is centered around automated analysis of images, mainly from online sources. While human recognition, also known as face detection, is an important research topic for the future, the current state of automated computer vision has focused on simple face detection, such as recognizing face, or face contours; detecting the distance between two objects; or recognizing a single shape features. The aim of this work is to find a more comprehensive approach or paradigm for facial detection, which will enable computer vision research to be carried out in a more advanced manner in the near future. Our proposed approach uses several deep learning models to represent the features of the human face, and combines these with the knowledge of each feature in order to model the user's facial expressions, thereby creating a novel facial detection framework. The proposed approach enables machine learning to deal with complex and diverse problems, ranging from tracking the facial movements of faces, to detecting facial distortions. Our results support the idea that deep learning has the potential to increase computational efficiency and make computer vision accessible to a large community of researchers.\n\nThe goal of this work is to demonstrate that deep learning achieves super-realtime facial landmark detection. With this approach, the neural networks can learn to discover landmarks on the basis of unsupervised feature learning, to achieve a state-of-the-art performance of 6.4% in a task where only 20% of the images were annotated with landmark boundaries. To demonstrate the validity of our work, we analyzed the accuracy and accuracy of our proposed approach against the state-of-the-art of existing",
    "Observations of an EXO-200 background in radioactive rock obtained from the Mt. Baker–Snoqualmie National Monument in Washington State indicate that the emission of radioactivity from the radioactive geochemistry of the rock is significantly higher than that of natural geological sources, probably due to a very high rate of radioactive decay in the rock. This background has been detected at a number of distances from the source, implying that the background must arise from a physical process, possibly due to the interaction between the geochemistry of the rock and an external field. A comparison between the background-induced emissions and background values of ambient background radiation suggests that the background was generated by radioiodine decay.\n\nThe article also includes the following short, but very useful, video clip from a presentation called \"How a Geologist Obtains a Radioactive Background for Exo-200\" by David M.

    "\"Our main idea in this paper is about the efficient evaluation of a compact version of product or product space. According to this strategy, a compact space consists of a set of linear products, and a set of linear filters over this set. Here, linear maps are used to specify the compactness property of the (filtered) compact set of products, which are known as product space. In our case, we evaluate the composition of a linear map with the product space itself by selecting at random a linear map of all fixed dimensions. In contrast to other work, we do not specify, at first sight, a specific choice of \"product\", but rather take the property of nonlinearity of the filters. Such a property, which is not known to the author of such analysis, is not easily definable by using finite series or other traditional nonlinearity tests. In addition to the usual nonlinearity tests, we also take advantage of the property of compactness to the filter, which gives a good approximation to the nonlinearity. As a consequence, using a product space as an efficient (or inefficient) measure for the nonlinearity of a filter is both correct and a generalization of the usual nonlinearity tests from regularity to compactness. Concretely, we first introduce an optimization scheme that we call \"narrower product space,\" which we prove that a compact compact collection of products (or products of filters) will be compact if and only if both this compact collection and the selected filter have a finite complement. In other words, the selection of a filter in the product space must be as specific as that of a linear map in the collection space. A generalization of our method is that any fixed pair of linear maps can be selected without restriction by simply selecting random elements from the selection between them. Moreover, given a \"filter\" and some product space, we show that this product space is always compact, and thus compact in any sense in which product space is defined in an efficient and general way. \"\n\n\nHere is an animation of our proof in practice:",

    "We demonstrate remote quantum transmission at room temperature and high precision through polarization polarization switching, providing unprecedented capability to transfer large quantities of information in the near future by using a single photon as channel. At room temperature the photon carries out four polarization state transitions.

In this way, data can be transmitted without loss or errors over distances exceeding several kcm. We address other challenges such as high quality interconnects, energy management and efficient use of laser power. The proposed algorithms are designed together with the requirements of commercial applications where real-time quantum communications is paramount.

    "In this work we address a novel form of sputter on polar surfaces, where multiple particles are produced by light trapped within a rotating beam cavity. The result can be defined as an interference pattern, which may show up either symmetrically with respect to the orientation of particle origin/destination or asymmetric. Similar results were obtained previously using light trapping on metallic surfaces using a highly modified type of rotary tunneling microscope (MTM) [4], which permitted a large number of particle pairs in exchange (see Methods). In particular, we exploit this method on thin film graphene prepared in a three-dimensional channel. When one single pair of electrons is transferred across each graphene molecule at a single energy level, an electric potential difference and electromagnetic force arise between two adjacent pairs, that induces their formation in the same direction. As in the case of optical trapping on the metal substrate, we observe a rotation and sputtering effect at much lower frequencies when several such pairs occur in simultaneous locations along a given longitudinal axis [5]. At low atomic voltage (~8 eV), the resulting forces lead to emission waves emanating from nearby electrode locations (E i and E j ) that propagate along the surface, generating a complex system of correlated electronic charge density fluctuations that propagate outwardly throughout the entire sample length. These electric fields are more prevalent near edge regions due to the polarization angle between charged electron centers and oxygen atoms that is slightly different from the normal polarity of oxygen molecules. Since both center charges have approximately 180° symmetry, they create opposite electrical currents and magnetic moments, similar to those found for circular polarized beams (e.g., CVDs; Fig. 3a) whose induced electromagnetic field tends to push electrons toward one another. Thus for our experimental probe setup, only the most intense energy levels are capable of driving these effects on solid films on both sides of a vertical plane perpendicular to the original direction of motion. We also find that while all electron emissions generated upon interaction are directed away from the electrodes owing to the current dependence, the emitted trajectories remain distinct in various orientations depending on the applied directional magnetic field. Because spatial separation and polarization are extremely important parameters in the underlying mechanism (i.e., interparticle electric dipoles during particle generation and then recombination and spin dynamics), they determine how spatially separated excitations generate a complex wavefield with distinctive",

    "\n\nThe Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics is a simple and elegant way of understanding the much-mysterious quantum realm. The key idea is that there is a multiplicity of universes, or \"worlds\", each of which evolves independently of the others. According to the MWI, every quantum event splits the universe into multiple universes, each universe containing a different outcome of the event. Therefore, every quantum event leads to a branching of the multiverse.\n\nThe MWI has been found to be a very successful interpretation of quantum mechanics, able to explain many of the strange and seemingly bizarre properties of the quantum realm. In particular, it provides a natural way of understanding the phenomenon of quantum interference, one of the most striking and counter-intuitive aspects of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe MWI also has some intriguing implications for the nature of reality. In particular, it suggests that the universe we experience is just one of an infinite number of universes, each with its own version of us.

Our method is motivated by the fact that, in many medical image segmentation tasks, only a few annotations are needed for the model to achieve high performance. To this end, we first train a segmentation model with only a few annotated samples. Then, we use the model to predict the labels for a large number of unannotated samples. Finally, we select a small number of samples with high entropy as the query set for the next round of annotation. We compare our method with several state-of-the-art methods on two 3D medical image segmentation tasks, and the results demonstrate that our method can achieve significant performance improvement with only a small number of annotations.",

    "\n\nImage-level data augmentation (D. A.) is a standard way to improve the robustness of deep neural networks for semantic image segmentation. However, recent studies have shown that D. A. at the object-level can further improve the performance of semantic segmentation models. In this paper, we propose ObjectAug, a simple yet effective object-level D.

It then randomly selects a subset of the proposals and applies a set of user-specified augmentation operations to them. The augmentations are applied only to the object proposals and not to the whole image. The augmented proposals are then used to generate the final segmentation map by \"filling in\" the pixels inside the proposals with the corresponding object labels. ObjectAug can be applied to any semantic segmentation model and does not require any modifications to the model or its training procedure. We evaluated ObjectAug on the PASCAL VOC 2012 andCityscapes semantic segmentation datasets.

    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to semantic segmentation known as attention-guided supervised contrastive learning (AGSCL). This method combines the strengths of both supervised contrastive learning and attention mechanisms to improve visual feature representation and enhance segmentation accuracy.\n\nSupervised contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful tool for self-supervised learning in computer vision tasks, but it relies heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which may be difficult or expensive to obtain. Attention mechanisms, on the other hand, have proven effective in selectively focusing on relevant regions in images, but they require careful design and tuning. AGSCL addresses these limitations by integrating an attention module into the contrastive loss function, allowing the model to learn richer representations that capture semantically meaningful features while reducing the need for annotated data.\n\nThe proposed framework consists of two main components: an encoder network followed by a projection head, and a contrastive loss function modified with the attention mechanism. The encoder network is trained to encode input images into latent vectors that preserve spatial hierarchies, while the projection head generates pseudo labels based on the predicted class probabilities. The attention module computes a weighted sum of the latent vectors using attention weights learned from the same dataset, enhancing the importance of instances within each mini-batch that are similar in appearance and context. These attended latent vectors then serve as inputs to the contrastive loss function, which encourages positive pairs (i.e., different views of the same instance) to stay close together while pushing negative ones apart.\n\nWe evaluate our method extensively on several benchmark datasets, including Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and COCO. Our experiments demonstrate that AGSCL outperforms traditional supervised contrastive learning and achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods, despite requiring significantly fewer annotations. Furthermore, the incorporation of attention allows the model to better handle occlusions, clutter, and intra-class variations. Visualizations of attention maps reveal insightful patterns that highlight the effectiveness of localizing salient regions.\n\nOur work not only advances the state-of-the",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach for 3D biomedical image segmentation that combines fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Our proposed method leverages the strengths of both FCNs and RNNs to improve the accuracy and efficiency of 3D image segmentation.\n\nFCNs have shown great success in image segmentation tasks due to their ability to learn rich feature representations from raw pixel data. However, they are limited by their inability to model complex spatial relationships between pixels. On the other hand, RNNs are well-suited for modeling sequential data and can capture long-range dependencies, but they struggle with processing large datasets and require significant computational resources.\n\nOur proposed approach addresses these limitations by combining FCNs and RNNs into a single network architecture. The FCN component is used to extract high-level features from the input data, while the RNN component refines the segmentation results by modeling the spatial relationships between neighboring voxels. We implement our approach using a popular deep learning framework and evaluate it on several publicly available 3D biomedical image datasets.\n\nThe experimental results demonstrate that our combined FCN-RNN approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, we achieve an average dice similarity coefficient of 0.85 on the BraTS dataset, which represents a 12% improvement over the next best performing method. Additionally, our approach reduces the computational cost by a factor of 4 compared to traditional FCN-based methods.\n\nWe also perform a series of ablation studies to analyze the contributions of each network component and provide insights into the working mechanism of our approach. The results suggest that the combination of FCNs and RNNs is essential for achieving optimal performance, as neither component alone can match the performance of the full network.\n\nIn conclusion, our work demonstrates the potential of combining FCNs and RNNs for 3D biomedical image segmentation. The proposed approach has important implications for various medical applications, such as tumor detection, lesion characterization, and",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach for semantic segmentation of very fine resolution urban scene images, titled Bilateral Awareness Network (BAN). BAN combines the strengths of transformer and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of semantic segmentation.\n\nThe transformer architecture has shown great success in various natural language processing tasks, but its application in computer vision tasks is limited due to its inability to process spatial information. On the other hand, CNNs are well-suited for image processing tasks, but their receptive field is limited, which hinders their ability to capture long-range dependencies.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose a bilateral attention mechanism that integrates the strengths of both transformer and CNNs. The bilateral attention mechanism allows the network to attend to both local and global features, enabling it to capture both fine-grained details and long-range dependencies.\n\nThe BAN architecture consists of a CNN backbone, a transformer encoder, and a bilateral attention module. The CNN backbone extracts local features, which are then fed into the transformer encoder to capture long-range dependencies. The bilateral attention module is used to combine the local and global features, allowing the network to focus on the most relevant information.\n\nWe evaluate the BAN on several benchmark datasets, including Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and CamVid.

    "This paper presents a novel approach to image segmentation, Learning to Segment from Scribbles using Multi-scale Adversarial Attention Gates (MSAAG). The proposed method leverages the power of adversarial attention mechanisms to learn a robust and accurate segmentation model from sparse annotated data.\n\nExisting methods rely heavily on fully supervised learning, requiring large amounts of manually labeled data. In contrast, MSAAG uses scribble annotations, which are significantly easier and faster to obtain, yet still provide valuable information about the location of objects in an image. By incorporating multi-scale features and adaptive attention gates, our model is able to effectively focus on the most relevant regions of an image and learn rich semantic representations.\n\nThe key innovation of MSAAG lies in its ability to integrate spatial and channel-wise attention into a single module. This enables the model to learn both local and global context, leading to improved performance compared to traditional attention-based approaches. Additionally, we introduce a new loss function that encourages the model to produce smooth and consistent segmentation masks, further enhancing overall accuracy.\n\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MSAAG outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentation models on several benchmark datasets.

    "In this paper, we present a novel approach for computing the ground and first excited states of the fractional Schrödinger equation in an infinite potential well. The fractional Schrödinger equation, which is a generalization of the classical Schrödinger equation, has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its ability to describe the behavior of non-local systems. However, solving the fractional Schrödinger equation in the presence of an infinite potential well has proven to be a challenging task, particularly for the ground and first excited states.\n\nOur approach uses a combination of numerical and analytical techniques to compute the ground and first excited states of the fractional Schrödinger equation in an infinite potential well. We first reformulate the problem in terms of a fractional differential equation, which we then solve using a numerical method. We also derive an analytical expression for the ground state energy and wave function, which we compare to our numerical results.\n\nOur results show that the ground state energy and wave function of the fractional Schrödinger equation in an infinite potential well are significantly different from those of the classical Schrödinger equation. In particular, we find that the ground state energy of the fractional Schrödinger equation is lower than that of the classical Schrödinger equation, and that the wave function of the fractional Schrödinger equation has a more spread-out structure.\n\nWe also compute the first excited state of the fractional Schrödinger equation, which is found to be much more sensitive to the parameter of the potential well than the ground state. Our results provide new insights into the behavior of non-local systems in the presence of an infinite potential well, and demonstrate the power of the fractional Schrödinger equation for modeling such systems.\n\nOverall, our work represents a significant step forward in the study of the fractional Schrödinger equation in the presence of an infinite potential well, and demonstrates the potential of this equation for describing the behavior of non-local systems in a wide range of physical and mathematical contexts.",
    "This paper proposes a novel approach to estimating the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, a widely used metric for evaluating the performance of binary classification models. Existing methods for estimating the ROC curve often suffer from non-smoothness, which can lead to inaccurate inference and visualization. In this paper, we propose a new method that leverages log-concave density estimates to construct a smooth ROC curve estimator.\n\nOur approach is based on the observation that the ROC curve can be represented as the boundary of a set of log-concave densities. Using this representation, we develop a method to estimate the ROC curve by fitting a log-concave density to the data and then computing the boundary of the resulting probability simplex. We show that our estimator has several desirable properties, including smoothness, consistency, and asymptotic normality.\n\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and real-data examples, comparing our estimator to existing methods in terms of smoothness, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Our results show that our estimator exhibits superior performance in terms of smoothness and accuracy, while also being computationally efficient.\n\nOur paper makes an important contribution to the field of statistics and machine learning by providing a novel approach to estimating the ROC curve that is smooth, consistent, and asymptotically normal. The proposed method has important implications for a wide range of applications, including medical diagnosis, image classification, and decision-making under uncertainty.",
    "In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for understanding the phenomenon of weakly nonlinear self-sustained detonations. Detonations are powerful explosive events that occur when a combustible medium undergoes a rapid chemical reaction, leading to a rapid release of energy and a shock wave that can propagate over long distances.\n\nSelf-sustained detonations are a specific type of detonation that maintain their strength over time, without any external energy input. They are characterized by a feedback loop where the energy released by the chemical reaction heats the medium, which in turn accelerates the reaction rate, sustaining the detonation.\n\nWeakly nonlinear self-sustained detonations are a regime of self-sustained detonations where the reaction rate is slightly affected by the temperature of the medium. This regime is characterized by a small perturbation in the reaction rate that grows over time, leading to a periodic or quasi-periodic behavior.\n\nIn this paper, we develop a theory that describes the dynamics of weakly nonlinear self-sustained detonations. We use a combination of analytical and numerical methods to study the behavior of the system and demonstrate the existence of periodic and quasi-periodic solutions. We show that these solutions are stable and can be sustained over long times, providing a theoretical explanation for the observed behavior of weakly nonlinear self-sustained detonations.\n\nOur results have important implications for the understanding of nonlinear phenomena in combustion and chemical reactions.

    "In this paper, we present a novel approach for efficient transmission and accurate segmentation of 3D medical images in the clouds using machine vision guided 3D medical image compression. With the increasing use of 3D medical imaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound, the need for efficient and accurate transmission and segmentation of large volumes of 3D medical data has become more important than ever.\n\nCurrent compression methods for 3D medical images often suffer from high computational complexity, poor image quality, and limited accuracy in segmentation.

In the pre-processing stage, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the features of the 3D medical images and reduce the dimensionality of the data.

    "Iris recognition is a widely used biometric modality that has gained significant attention in recent years due to its high accuracy and resistance to fraud. However, the presence of eye pathologies can significantly affect the performance of iris recognition systems, leading to incorrect identifications or false negatives. This paper investigates the impact of various eye pathologies on iris recognition and proposes novel approaches to improve the accuracy of iris recognition in such cases.\n\nA comprehensive review of existing literature on iris recognition and eye pathologies was conducted, followed by a thorough analysis of the effects of different types of eye pathologies on iris recognition. The study also involved the collection of a dataset of images of eyes with various pathologies and the development of a new algorithm designed specifically to handle these conditions.\n\nThe results showed that certain eye pathologies, such as cataracts, glaucoma, and uveitis, have a significant negative impact on the accuracy of iris recognition. In particular, cataracts were found to cause the most significant degradation in iris quality, resulting in a decrease in recognition accuracy of up to 30%. The proposed algorithm, which incorporates advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, was able to mitigate this effect and achieve an accuracy rate of over 95% even in the presence of severe eye pathologies.\n\nThis research demonstrates the importance of considering eye pathologies when designing and implementing iris recognition systems, particularly in applications where security and accuracy are paramount, such as border control or law enforcement. The findings suggest that the use of specialized algorithms and image processing techniques can significantly improve the robustness of iris recognition systems and enable their reliable operation even in challenging scenarios.",

    "In this paper, we demonstrate a novel method for optically addressing an individual erbium ion in silicon using a focused laser beam. Erbium ions are commonly used in quantum computing and photonic devices due to their unique optical properties. However, addressing individual ions in a dense ensemble can be challenging, especially when they are embedded in a solid-state matrix like silicon.\n\nOur approach leverages the fact that the absorption cross-section of erbium ions is strongly dependent on the polarization state of the incident light. By carefully controlling the polarization of a focused laser beam, we were able to selectively excite a single erbium ion within a densely doped silicon sample. The ion's fluorescence emission was then collected through a high numerical aperture objective and analyzed using a spectrometer.\n\nWe observed a clear anti-correlation between the ion's fluorescence intensity and the laser power, indicating that the ion's excited state population was being depleted by the laser-induced spin-flip process. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the ion's fluorescence could be switched on and off by modulating the laser's polarization, allowing us to precisely control the ion's quantum state.\n\nThis work represents a significant advancement in the field of quantum optics and has important implications for the development of scalable quantum information processing architectures based on rare earth ions in silicon.

Our approach leverages the strengths of non-negative matrix factorization and sparse graph representation to create a robust and efficient graph model that can accurately capture the complex relationships between data points.\n\nThe proposed method consists of two main stages. First, we use a non-negative matrix factorization technique to decompose the data matrix into two low-rank matrices, which capture the underlying structure of the data. We then use these matrices to construct a sparse graph, where each node represents a data point and the edges represent the similarity between the data points.\n\nThe key innovation of our method is the use of data-adaptive features, which are learned from the data itself. These features are used to weight the edges in the graph, allowing the model to selectively focus on the most important relationships between data points. This results in a graph that is both sparse and informative, making it well-suited for tasks such as clustering, classification, and dimensionality reduction.\n\nWe evaluate our method on several real-world datasets and compare it to state-of-the-art graph construction methods.

    "In this paper, we investigate the crossover of three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator Bi2Se3 to the two-dimensional (2D) limit. By employing a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, we explore the topological phase transition that occurs as the thickness of the material is reduced from 3D to 2D.\n\nUsing first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the 3D Dirac cone of Bi2Se3 flattens and forms a 2D Dirac cone as the thickness decreases, resulting in a topological insulator-to-metal transition. We also observe the occurrence of quantum spin Hall effect in the 2D limit, which is characterized by the presence of topologically protected edge states.\n\nFurthermore, we experimentally study the crossover using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and observe a strong dependence of the Fermi velocity on the thickness of the material. We find that the Fermi velocity decreases as the thickness decreases, indicating a transition from a 3D to a 2D Fermi surface.\n\nOur results provide a comprehensive understanding of the crossover of Bi2Se3 from a 3D topological insulator to a 2D metal, and shed light on the topological phase transition that occurs in this process.

    "The flood filling game, also known as the connected dominos game, two colors and one match or the kite dominoes game was introduced by Tardos et Al in 2015 [TKSS], a year after Ailon et al had already shown that the problem was not polynomially solvable on planar maps [ASTW]. In this game a player starts with either black or white tiles and places them adjacent to at least one tile which is initially placed. These tiles are then covered (flooded) if they form a rectangle and only if all sides have an equal number of white and black squares. Once each square has been flooded we say that the board or map is filled. This process continues but only squares which can be completely covered without leaving any edge uncovered may be picked up next. We are interested in how many moves it takes so that every square in the given map gets covered, especially considering some special cases like convex polygons, rectangles, trees etc. We give polynomial time algorithms for deciding whether a map is indeed fillable using O(n^3log*n)-time algorithm to solve the minimum problem in planars or finding out if there exists a particular move sequence using SCC decompositions followed by Euler Tour technique. Further we look into the behaviour of this graph when edges incident on different SCCs' get deleted independently. With increasing knowledge about this decomposition helps us deduce certain relationships between tree width, max degree of the decomposition tree and the size of maximal clique containing vertices from more than one SCC.",

    "The increasing availability and popularity of digital pathological images have led to an active area of automatic image classification known as Digital Pathological Analysis (DPA). These algorithms aim at reducing analysis time, by using deep learning models that can replicate expert decisions. However, they are not very robust when facing variations on patient/slide characteristics which leads to limitations due to inter-observer variability and inconsistency across sites or scanners.. For example, a segmenting algorithm might be trained to correctly detect cancerous nuclei at 20X on two particular specimen slides. But if it’s deployed, will it generalize to new specimens? One answer lies with ensembling where multiple decision tree nodes make up the output classifier — this has been shown to help address such issues..

    "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6597\nA new generalization of the Inflaton with an exponential potential (IEP) model, which incorporates possible deviations to pure de Sitter expansion during inflation, has been proposed recently for providing an estimate to the primordial fluctuations in the Universe at any order with a good accuracy and simultaneously explaining all observational results on inflation with no need of an extra sector or mechanism to produce the fluctuations without contradiction with the other standard predictions on inflation. This work shows that this class of theories has interesting implications: firstly it predicts the existence of several plateau regions with specific non-vanishing values of the scalar field, leading as predicted to almost flat spectra; secondly the presence of these additional steps gives rise to primordial perturbation functions that have features similar to those obtained within the Starobinsky' s or Hills-Politzer model that can be seen as limits of our proposal. These predictions are explored with emphasis on how observable they are, but also giving them analytical expressions that we show agree very well with numerical ones and allowing us even to propose some phenomenological formulae for comparison with data.",

We consider a\ngeneralized approach to derive the equilibrium properties of conserved\nmany particle systems by extending earlier work by Sano [1] which in\nturn was inspired by work by Havrda, Charv\\'at and others [2,3,4] and\nTsallis [5].\n\nThis formalism includes both entropic functions of finite and infinite\ndifferentiation but it takes a finite number of differentiations\nand limits to include and deal with the situation of finite\ndegrees of freedom systems that are not infinite.\n\nIn particular this formalism allows to take into account conserved\nproperties of systems of any kind like the number of particles or\ninverse temperature.\n\nThen this formalism also allows to derive the equilibrium\nproperties, and the equilibrium distributions of systems consisting of\na finite number of entities that obey the laws of a Boltzman-like\ndistribution - which is known to contain the Gaussian distribution as\na special case when the inverse temperature approaches a finite\nvalue of zero.\n\nWe also derive that the same equilibrium properties that follow from\nthis finite differentiation, finite degrees of freedom formalism are\ncompatible with well-defined conditions on the conservation of\nenergy - or alternatively the conservation of the number of\ndegrees of freedom, or equivalently the conserved distribution\n(i.e. in our case of the conserved probability distribution of the\nnumber of particles of the original system in some arbitrary initial\nstate).",
    "> We present an approach that learns to segment images using only image-level labels, without any pixel-wise or bounding box annotations. Our method uses a novel loss function which encourages the network to predict a set of semantically meaningful regions in each image. This allows us to train our model on large datasets such as ImageNet and MS COCO where there are no pixel-wise annotations available. In addition, we show how this loss can be used to improve existing methods by providing additional supervision during training. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on several benchmarks including PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes.",
    "> In this paper, we propose an image segmentation model which combines normalized cut (NC) criterion with adaptive similarity measure and spatial regularization term to improve the performance of NC-based methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Firstly, we introduce a new similarity function that can be used as a general replacement for the commonly used Euclidean distance or correlation coefficient. This new similarity function has two advantages over these traditional measures: it is more robust against noise and outliers; and its parameter can be automatically determined by minimizing the objective function without any prior knowledge about the data distribution. Secondly, we incorporate a spatial regularization term into the original NC formulation so that the resulting energy functional becomes convex and thus easier to optimize. Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results show that our approach achieves better segmentation quality than other state-of-the-art algorithms while being much faster due to its low computational complexity.",
    "Abstract:\nThe main purpose of this research is proposing an automated linear function submission-based double auction (ABLDS) as a real-time pricing (RTP) mechanism for large scale prosumers' electricity network in an energy system with decentralised network of prosumers, in\nwhich the main features of price elasticity of supply are accounted. In this paper, a modified double auction-based mechanism with linear functions as market-clearing bids and offers is presented for bottom-up RTP of prosumers' electricity.\n\nIn the presented mechanism, by using the linear functions each prosumer offers two linear functions as bid and offer bids, and the market-clearing bid and the market-clearing offer are generated as the highest and lowest linear functions in the bids and offers, respectively. It is also shown that, by the introduced mechanism, the price elasticity of each load is considered. The proposed algorithm has a complexity of O(n log((n))) in which n demonstrates the number of prosumers. The complexity is relatively high, but it will be significantly reduced by the fact that there are only a small number of price-elastic load that will be active in the market. Thus, ABLDS can be considered more practical\nand applicable in real world. The results showed that the RTP can be performed successfully without being affected by malicious attackers, and provides an effective mechanism for the pricing in the prosumers’ electricity network.\n\nTo find more about RTP and smart grid:\n\nRenewable Energy: A Practical Approach - The book provides comprehensive coverage of the technical and regulatory aspects of renewable applications and systems.

    "#### Abstract:\n\nRecently, social dynamics became a popular research field in computer vision. It is well known that biological organisms have the capacity to exhibit collective behaviors and social cohesion. These abilities provide an effective solution for organizing social groups and for solving collective decision-making problems. They constitute significant means of organization among biological populations exhibiting various social behaviors including the formation of groups and swarms, schooling, and flocking. A large amount of the social behavior analysis falls into the category of social physics. It is a branch of social research which seeks a physical understanding on social behavior in the same way as the molecular model or the kinetic theory of gases. A simple model of the Deffuant-Weisbuch (DW) and social dynamical systems theory is developed here for the segmentation of images. It is found that the model converges to a stable state at the global minimum. The parameters of the model are automatically extracted from the intensity and spatial coherence statistics of the input images. By using different parameter values, different levels of segmentations can be generated. Thus, by using only a simple image processing model, we can achieve multi-resolution segmentation. It is observed that the DW model is robust to different input values and image conditions. However, it is sensitive to noise. Therefore, noise must be removed from the input as part of the pre- processing step.\n\n#### Original paper:\n\nM. Z. Khan, A. R. Mahmood, T. A. Ahmad, L. Aljibouri, M. M. El-Zagzag (2012).

    "#### Abstract\n\nGiven an operation n^a acting on positive integers, we define and study the related multi operation M(n), where M(n) counts how many different operations are needed to achieve n as their product. We prove that M(n) does not take values 1/2 or larger than some C=C (practically) forever when dealing with primes. For all odd prime exponents a, the sequence {M(pn)} has no terms in [0.5388974..., 1] while for even exponents it does, yet in practice no terms exceed 1-ε for any fixed ε>0 so effectively they can too be said never reach . In contrast though, there exists x≥0 such that any finite number k of operations produce infinitely many distinct x’s. We also provide bounds on these sequences which show for example that if b≥d then for sufficiently large n M(bn)> 0.5 M(bd).\nIn order to achieve this we use p-adic analyticity and adelic methods together and apply them to the problem at hand.",
    "In this work we explore how much simpler models than the winning approaches in ILSVRC-2014 can match thier performance when using better regularization techniques that control the complexity during training as well as at test time. By employing simple dropouts throughout all convolutional layers and introducing novel low/high resolution data augmentation on top we are able to produce state-of-the art results on ImageNet with only eight layers that require at least six times less computations during testing resulting in faster runtime. This simple architecture performs substantially better by achieving Top5 rate around 69% which matches state-of-the-art Deep RNNs trained under similar settings while being much smaller model with fewer parameters. Furthermore, such an approach allows us to easily train large ensemble networks without having to deal with very deep networks during test phase where fast and accurate predictions matter most. We demonstrate our method for producing compact ensembles by presenting three new models trained on ILSVRC-2013 dataset that reach accuracy around 80%.",
    "> Abstract: A new osmotic pressure equation has been derived based on experimental data and theoretical considerations, which improves upon the existing van’t Hoff equation by including an additional term to account for the effect of solute size (molecular weight) in addition to concentration. This new formula was tested experimentally using two different types of solutions with varying concentrations and molecular weights of solutes. It was found that the new formula provides better agreement between predicted and measured values than the van’t Hoff equation, particularly at higher concentrations or larger molecules. These results suggest that this new formula may be useful for predicting osmotic pressures under various conditions where traditional methods fail due to limitations such as high viscosity or non-ideal behavior.",
    "> We present an approach to few-shot segmentation that leverages both image and point cloud data, which we call \"Squeeze & Excite\". Our method uses a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from volumetric images, while also using a PointNet++ architecture to process point clouds extracted from these same images. These two feature representations are then combined in a novel way via attention mechanisms inspired by SENet [Hu et al., ICCV17]. This allows our model to leverage information about the spatial structure of objects within the scene as well as their appearance. In addition, we propose a new loss function based on the Dice coefficient that encourages the CNN to learn more discriminative features than traditional cross entropy losses. Experiments show that this combination leads to improved performance over state-of-the-art methods when training with only one or two examples per class.",
    "Authors: Vlada Stavropoulou and Christophe Prieur\nAbstract: We propose an image segmentation framework, taking into account both the intensity features extracted by non-local filtering, as well as the topological information provided by the spatial arrangement of superpixels computed locally in neighbourhoods using topology preservation methods such as Chamfer Distance (CD). Following recent works which have advocated that this additional prior can be useful to alleviate difficulties like occlusions or lighting variations when applied jointly with standard non-supervised density estimation based image clustering algorithms, we use it here within an unsupervised graph partitioning formulation that allows the definition of a large scale number of clusters at various degrees of granularity according to the local size of segments detected. As our proposed model contains only few parameters relative to CD, no optimization procedure is necessary for its fine tuning but one can simply adapt it easily given specific constraints to handle for a particular application with a high level of confidence on the results obtained. This approach has been validated experimentally on different datasets showing good performances.",

Our method uses a single convolutional neural network architecture to simultaneously detect boundaries between objects and classify pixels into object classes. This allows us to leverage information about object boundaries during pixel classification, improving performance on both tasks. In addition, our model can be trained end-to-end using only weakly labeled data, making it more scalable than existing methods that require expensive human labeling or additional training steps. Experiments show that CWAE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on several benchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes.",

    "\"We present DeepIGeoS (DIPS), a fully automated method for interactive segmentation of 3D medical images (brain MRIs, CTs, and 3D US). DIPs is a fast, accurate, and fully automatic 3D segmentation method that uses a unique and intuitive two-step algorithm. In the first step, the method automatically defines the regions where user interaction is needed. Next, 3D geodesic-based algorithms identify landmarks of the object of interest and then use this information to initialize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to segment the object within these landmarks. DIPS offers three unique advantages: i) it avoids time-consuming 3D landmarks selection, ii) it overcomes the segmentation challenges in images with large deformations, and iii) it outperforms other automated methods with the same computational complexity. We tested DIPs on 3D ultrasound (3DUS) and 3D CT and MR images of multiple organs (brain, liver, pancreas, uterus) and a large clinical dataset of 954 brain MRI scans. Our evaluation showcases a significant increase in accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art CNN segmentation method and significantly reduced training time.

    "In 2016, an approach employing a morphological feature representation based on dilations was proposed to significantly improve semantic segmentation performance over state-of-theart deep learning architectures and datasets on 2D medical images (Koohpayeh, K., O'Doherty M., Dhanesh S &amp; Bovis F., 2017a).

In particular we provide such “best possible” functionals versions of Holder's inequality for finite signed measures on a locally compact abelian group.\n> We find it striking and noteworthy at this stage to describe here briefly what one does when trying to find suitable weight functions for which an extension theorem should fail – as suggested by many examples that have appeared recently - in contrast with the unweighted case treated by our recent results in two previous papers. For general L1 spaces one may need to consider the more restrictive classes defined above. Let us mention further interesting issues coming into play through those questions. A natural approach would consist therefore to look carefully at the behaviour under linear transformations of products of exponentials, given their importance both classical aspects of measure theory discussed above and in analytical number theory, where they are used to prove results concerning multiplicative characteristics and divisibility. For instance let θ ∈ [0,2/3[ be fixed, the set [∊ , 1/∀] U {e− κ i} consists precisely of all values taken on by exp(it log c ) = exp(c t) where p ∈ Primes .

    "\"Urban scene segmentation is a challenging task particularly because of the presence of occlusions and unforeseen objects. The lack of high-level information such as bounding box labels causes traditional segmentation algorithms to be less accurate. Hence, semi-supervised learning algorithms that can leverage high-level information in low labeled datasets with unlabeled data, such as images and videos, can be advantageous. However, the large amount of unlabeled video segments requires a computationally efficient method for segmentation. We present a segmentation method called Naive-Student based on a semi-supervised learning method (self-training) and a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-101). We propose a method to improve the efficiency of segmentation by increasing the accuracy of the self-training method.

    "> “An Active Galaxy emits, in addition to ordinary stellar light which it shares with other galaxies like our own Milky Way, unusually strong radiation in a part of electromagnetic spectrum that we call X-rays….Also remarkable are black hole mass estimates...”\n\nSaid another way an AGN has a disproportionately larger proportion of radiators - stars whose energy output exceeds solar levels – than our Galaxy and most every galaxy. A high correlation between supermassive central black holes and these extraordinarily luminous and distant AGNs appears likely, according to NASA astronomers. That means that more mass is converted at higher rates into visible wavelengths where we can see them – gamma rays (including microwave radio), infra-red, visual and ultra violet; but also in X-ray energies. Thus this work proposes an interpretation of the properties exhibited by such AGNs based on its model of dark matter halos around all galaxies including a dense core within the nuclear zone. This core’s gravitational field acceleration causes greater densities in those regions causing higher degrees of internal stress leading to intense thermodynamic heat. Such energy release is then coupled to prodigious particle emissions (mostly photons) at increasingly elevated energetic conditions through successively longer wavelengths towards the far ultraviolet, x ray region of the EM spectrum. It’s believed there are two distinct types of AGNs characterized as Seyfert (or X-ray binary) or quasars (“quasi-stellar objects”) based largely upon their characteristic spectral features observed in various bands along said spectrum. The present day luminosity of type 2 Seyferts appear relatively moderate compared to quasar types, whereas type 1s emit at even lower flux amplitudes. We will compare some simple models used to calculate surface temperature profiles versus known observations regarding color temperature curves and emission characteristics of AGN variants. These models assume a basic spherical symmetry about a point source although one should note that much of what characterizes these objects is inherently asymmetrical if taken in context of the local environs where they reside. Therefore each object possesses a unique set of circumstances that would need careful investigation before drawing any hasty conclusions. Nevertheless, these",

Here we present a canonical, geometrically defined, invariant for G_2 manifolds and generalise the construction to the setting of Riemannian manifolds admitting a parallel Clifford multiplication.

However, previous methods cannot generate complex scenes with fine grain level spatial control over objects or even scene layouts, making it particularly difficult to simulate dense crowds or interesting geometries like corners. We propose GEOSIM, an approach for generating geometrically correct synthetic videos that can better capture real traffic rules and more faithfully model rich environmental elements. Specifically for AV scenarios, we make two key contributions: 1) Incorporating detailed local geometry information into our DNN crowd model allows us to generate accurate multi-scale and geometrically consistent predictions for pedestrian trajectories without requiring ground truth labels at every timestep during training, thus enabling large scale training with massive scalability and little data annotation needed; 2) Our proposed end-to-end neural network architecture can produce convincing and diverse synthesized scenes matching user’s specifications about target scenes including number of people, car density/traffic light status etc. Such capability frees up developers' time by automatizing time intensive tasks associated with high quality interactive and visualization tests for selfdriving vehicles.

    "> The field of computer vision and multimedia is on the verge of a revolution. A significant number of applications have adopted deep learning techniques, specifically in the case of convolutional neural networks (CNN), and thus, CNN has revolutionized the area of image and video processing. In this work, we aim to develop a CNN network for real-time instance semantic image segmentation. To achieve this objective, we perform an exhaustive survey of published literature that implements instance semantic image segmentation for all available categories, and then present a novel framework that achieves significant improvements in the state of the art in terms of both performance and speed. Therefore, a novel CNN network called “Real-Time Deep Semantic Image Segmentation Network (RTD-SIS-Net)” that is designed to perform semantic image segmentation and to achieve real-time speed is presented in this study. In RTD-SIS-Net, we propose to use the deconvolutional layers instead of the fully convolution layers of Fully Convolution Networks (FCN) to create dense and precise segmentation maps to provide better quality for semantic image segmentation. In addition, we propose to apply the 1 × 1 and 3 × 3 convolution layers interweaved to significantly increase the quality of the segmentation maps. In addition, the proposed network in this study is more powerful than all existing methods, which results in more efficient utilization of the GPUs to achieve real-time performance. Furthermore, extensive experiments on numerous well-known datasets demonstrate that the proposed CNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for image segmentation.\n\nImage courtesy: Pixabay.",

    "Title: Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution with Modified Coherent States\nAbstract: We present a protocol for measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum key distribution with modified coherent states. Our modified coherent states enable us to generate more entangled photons, reducing the number of qubits required for secure communication over long distances.

    "The fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is a widely used technique in data analysis, which assigns each data point to one of k clusters with varying degrees of membership. This approach has several limitations such as sensitiveness to initial centroids and difficulty in handling nonlinearly separable clusters. To address these issues, we propose an extension to the fuzzy c-means algorithm called the vector membership (VM) method, where instead of assigning each data point to a single cluster at any given time, it first identifies its closest cluster center in terms of the Euclidean distance metric. Then, the membership value of each data point is updated based on how well it deviates from this center within its cluster boundaries, where neighboring clusters share common boundary points by definition. By iteratively applying this rule until convergence or reaching a maximum number of iterations, the VM method reduces computational complexity while preserving accurate results compared to other known techniques such as DBSCAN and OPTICS.

Our method involves first constructing a contour tree representation of the input surface, which captures its topological structure at multiple scales. We then apply a series of convolutional layers to extract features from each level of the contour tree, followed by a fully connected layer to classify the segments. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, particularly for surfaces with intricate shapes and hierarchical structures. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of using contour tree hierarchy as a powerful tool for improving the performance of deep neural network-based 3D surface segmentation tasks.",
    "This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the time reversal of light by linear dispersive filtering near atomic resonance. The authors demonstrate that by using a linear dispersive filter, it is possible to reverse the direction of time flow in a small region around an atomic resonance. The paper provides a detailed mathematical model of the process and shows that it is possible to achieve a high degree of time reversal with a relatively simple experimental setup. The results of this study have important implications for the development of new technologies in the field of quantum mechanics and could lead to new insights into the fundamental nature of time.",

    "Abstract:\nWe consider the global attractor problem for a viscous Navier-Stokes system driven by a periodic forcing and with a fast-slow dissipative term. In the framework of a general\n  class of equations that can describe the evolution of turbulent flows with rapid rotation, it is proved that the global attractor exists and it is connected. Then, we study its geometrical and topological properties and,\n  in particular, it is shown that the global attractor for the nonautonomous system has a finite number of singular points. Furthermore, a connection with dynamical systems is provided, by\n  obtaining the local asymptotic stability properties of the attractor.

    ">Referring image segmentation (RefSeg) estimates the object that matches a given reference in an image. In existing methods, the reference is extracted by the convolutional feature map in a single network, which suffers from two problems as follows. First, a reference may correspond to an extremely small area or an entire image. Second, this method only can perceive the local patterns in the feature map and fails to explore a global perception of the reference and image pair. To this end, we propose a novel RefSeg framework, named CMF. CMF consists of three modules, namely a global module, a local module, and a mask prediction module. Specifically, given an image and a reference, the global module first extracts an attention-aware global representation based on a global matching strategy. Then, the local module extracts a local representation according to the visual relationship between the image and reference. To eliminate the semantic gap between the global and local representations, a cascaded multimodel fusion module (CMF module) with multi-attention and multiple-model is proposed to fuse these two representations. Finally, a mask prediction module is proposed to predict a semantic mask based on the global and local representations. In particular, the CMF module leverages the global perception to perform a better reference refinement task, and the local perception further enhances the discriminability of the global perception by introducing a local perception. The experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art RefSeg methods.\n\n\nIntroduction\nReferring image segmentation (RefSeG), which refers to detecting and masking the target by specifying a natural language description [1], has been paid increasing attention recently as a fundamental task in the computer vision field. It requires machines to extract the target mentioned by text and segment it into a semantic mask. Recently, a number of methods for this task have been proposed [2][3][4][5][6]. Among them, deep learning-based methods [3][4][5] have rapidly achieved considerable progress. However, there are still many challenges due to their nature. For example, the reference mentioned by the text may refer to an extremely small area or a large area that occupies the whole image, making the task more challenging. Another issue is that it is hard to fully identify a target because the visual appearance of objects is",
    "Operational concurrency control is concerned with the implementation of concurrency control algorithms.\nUntil now, operational concurrency control solutions have been focused on providing a consistent view of a database\neven in the presence of high read and write latencies, rather than in the optimization of read and write latencies\nthemselves. Consequently, previous distributed systems research does not discuss the possibility of optimizing the\nperformance of operations themselves to increase concurrency without sacrificing database consistency.\n\nThis paper attempts to address this concern by considering a model of consistent concurrency control at the\noperation level. In particular, the paper proposes a set of distributed operation classes that define an equivalence\nclass for operations and describes the properties of these classes. It is shown that this model can be\nutilized to provide optimal performance for all operations in the presence of arbitrary read and write latencies.\n\nA consistent concurrency control algorithm is then derived that exploits this model. This algorithm is\nimplemented and benchmarked and compared with a number of existing algorithms in the presence of high\nread and write latencies. It is shown that this algorithm outperforms all of its competitors, often\nproviding improvements of up to a factor of 10, while maintaining the desired consistency semantics of the\ndatabase.\n\nThe full text of this research paper can be found at: [Operational Concurrency Control in the Face of Arbitrary Scale and Latency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01161.pdf)\n\n# Requirements\n\n* Python >= 3.4\n* pip\n\n# Installation\n\nClone or download the repository, then...\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n# Getting Started\n\nTo run the benchmarks...\n\n```bash\npython -m benchmark\n```\n\n...will launch a benchmark of all algorithms in the paper.

    "\"Aerial image semantic segmentation has recently witnessed substantial breakthroughs using deep models. However, these large-scale aerial images often have thousands of classes or objects and it's unclear whether existing segmentation algorithms are suitable for such tasks. Unlike the common practice of leveraging point cloud annotations for object detection/segmentation, we propose to use a point-based feature representation and propose a novel method named PointFlow, which is applicable to a wide range of modern computer vision algorithms. The PointFlow is trained on two phases (a flow prediction phase and a segmentation task). The first phase takes advantage of the sparse 3D point cloud annotations to learn the coarse flows from a sparse 3D point cloud. The flows are then learned through point-wise supervision in the second phase in a self-supervised manner. PointFlow is a generalizable feature which can be easily used in popular 2D CNNs. Extensive experiments on the aerial images with thousands of categories show that PointFlow outperforms its point-based competitors by a large margin.

The two self-attention modules can be treated as a transformer encoder; the mask attention module integrates the information of point features, which is the key to the model's generalization ability. In addition, we use a point-based sparse feature representation, in which each point represents a unique class, resulting in a better feature expression ability and an improved data balance in semantic segmentation.

    "> Deep learning has achieved great success in medical image segmentation. However, the performance of deep learning models is highly dependent on the quality of the training data. In practice, the training data are often corrupted by noisy labels, which can significantly degrade the performance of the model.

Then at test time when given real-world input images containing objects that are not present during training phase but have similar geometry or topology compared those seen before then it will automatically adapt itself without any supervision signal provided explicitly through labels like class names etc., thus making this system more robust against unseen classes while still being able perform well enough even though there might exist some differences between them due their inherent nature e g different textures colors sizes scales orientations poses rotations angles speeds velocities accelerations decelerating rates acceleration profiles braking patterns stopping distances reaction times response curves trajectories paths routes tracks courses directions destinations goals targets objectives purposes intentions outcomes effects consequences results impacts causes origins sources beginnings endings ends finishes terminations conclusions resolutions solutions answers questions responses explanations clarifications interpretations understandings insights discoveries findings revelations breakthroughs inventions creations developments innovations advancements improvements enhancements upgrades modifications alterations adjustments augmentatons additions deletions subtractions removals replacements substitutions variations deviations departures digressions diversions detours excursuses side trips sidelines sidetracks meander wander deviate stray diverge swerve veer drift roam ramble range prowl stroll saunter amble perambulate promenade strut parade march tramp traipse walk trot jog run sprint gallop scamper scurry dash race fly zoom rocket speed rush tear streak shoot zip whiz whoosh hurtle careening skid slide spin whirl twirl rotate revolve orbit circle gyrate turn twist roll tumble flip flutter flap vibrate quiver jiggle shake shimmy wag wigw ag tremor pulsate throb palpitate beat thump pound hammer knock rap tap clap slap bang rattle drum buzz hum drone roar rum bleep croak chirp tweet squeal squawk caw crow screech hissing purr growl grunt moo oink bellow bray neigh snort baa lowing bark howling yowl moan whimpering sobbing weeping crying shrieking screaming yelling shouting holler hollaring caterwauling ululating warbling whistlesong",

This concept will open new opportunities into understanding structure / function relationships where novel material properties may emerge due their own internal structural arrangement; e.g., chirality induced by directional selection rules based solely off polarization considerations alone! I'm presenting here some preliminary thoughts toward this goal through exploring what happens when we take those aforementioned ideas forward yet again– adding now another layer onto things like stacking two sets orthogonal planes together forming 3D arrays inside out space bounded only.

    "There are many problems in computer vision, computer graphics, image processing and robotics which can be written as a binary quadratic optimization problem. Although the problem is NP-hard in general, we can tackle the problem using many techniques because of its convexity. In this paper, we propose to use a semidefinite relaxation of the problem to solve large-scale tasks. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we derive a fast solver which has less than 10 lines of code. We run comparative experiments for several visual problems, including shape fitting, feature selection, semantic segmentation and non-rigid shape registration, and report satisfactory results.\nIn general, a binary quadratic optimization problem takes the form:\n\\[ max_{x \\in \\mathbf{R}^n: \\mathbf{1}^Tx=1} x^TAx \\\\ s.t. Bx = b, \\]\nwhere A ∈ Rn×n, b ∈ Rn.\nSemidefinite relaxations (SDP) are a standard relaxation method which is widely used for polynomial optimization problems. An SDP relaxes a problem by replacing linear constraints with quadratic constraints, and the objective function with a convex one. Such a relaxation is usually tractable. However, in reality there are no guarantees that solving the SDP problem provides a feasible/optimal solution to the original problem.\nThe best-known polynomial relaxation for a linear problem is the semidefinite relaxation.\nFor an unknown x, this relaxation leads to the following program, denoted $\\sigma[P]$:\n$\\min_{\\Sigma\\succeq 0} f(\\Sigma)$\nwhere Σ ∈ Rd×d and\n$f(\\Sigma) = \\frac{1}{2} \\tr{(B^T\\Sigma+A^T-b^Tb)} + \\tr{(A\\Sigma)}$.\nThe above problem can be solved very efficiently by leveraging on semidefinite programming solvers. Once we have a solution Σ, we could recover the desired feasible point x by solving the following simple equation:\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} I_d \\\\ -B\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ \\lambda \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\Sigma \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nHere",

    "This paper presents a new semi-supervised segmentation method for electron microscopy images, called Semi-supervised Hierarchical Merge Tree (SSHMT). It is inspired by the fact that the segmentation task is strongly dependent on the quality of the labeled samples. We propose an algorithm that iteratively produces pseudo labels for unlabeled samples so as to increase the quality of the whole segmentation model via active learning. The SSHMT method is based on the hierarchical merge tree (HMT) method. During each iteration, a number of samples are selected according to a distance-based acquisition function. These samples generate pseudo labels and are added into the labeled dataset.\nSSHMT also introduces a new concept of uncertainty which captures the confidence of the model on a given sample. These two components (acquisition function and uncertainty) are further adapted in an attention-based neural network to produce powerful pseudo labels. This novel method has been validated on three different electron microscopy datasets and has also been compared with other well-known segmentation methods. In general, our method has outperformed others on almost every dataset and has demonstrated particularly impressive results for the largest of them.\nThe following is the full text of the abstract for a research paper titled \"Active Learning on Real-World Data Using a Hierarchical Gaussian Process Model\" from arxiv.org:\nWe propose an algorithm to make active learning as effective as possible on real-world datasets where only a few labeled examples are initially available. In order to do so, we propose a novel method to estimate the uncertainty associated with any sample in any dataset.

Compared to other methods, our hierarchical Gaussian process model allows to: i) have better uncertainty estimates about individual samples even though only a few labeled examples are available; ii) exploit previous evaluations of the classifier when they are available. Extensive experiments on a large variety of binary real-world classification tasks - ranging from the well known handwritten digit recognition task to a novel task on real face images - show that our method results in an average reduction of 10% of the number of evaluations necessary to reach an arbitrary accuracy threshold, with only a minimal degradation of the classification performance.
