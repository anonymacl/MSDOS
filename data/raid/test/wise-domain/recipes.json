    "2 poblano/pasilla peppers\n1 onion, chopped\n3 fresh corn, kernels cut off\n1/2 cup chicken/veggie broth or water\nsplash cream/whole milk\n1/4 pound queso fresco, cubed\nChar the peppers. Poblano pepper skins have a slightly bitter taste so you need to get it off. In order to do this you have 2 options. If you have a gas stove that produces a flame, char the peppers over the flame until the skin is black and blistered over the whole pepper. I have an electric stove so what I do is set the oven to broil and move one of the racks up to the very top. Broil the peppers, rotating as soon as the skin by the broiler is black, until it's charred on all sides. Put the charred peppers in a plastic bag or in a bowl covered in plastic as soon as they're done being charred to steam it so the skin peels off easily. Peel the peppers. Some peppers are a little spicy so wearing gloves could be useful. Peel all the skin off the peppers. Then remove the stem, seeds and veins. Slice into strips. Heat some olive or vegetable oil over medium heat in a pan big enough to hold all the corn and peppers. Saute the onion until clear and fragrant. Add the corn kernels, peppers and broth. Simmer covered for about 15 minutes. Add the splash of cream and remove from heat. Stir in cheese and enjoy.",

Cut these strips into julienne, (small strips 1/16 inch wide and 1 1/12 inches long). Simmer for 15 minutes in a quart of water. Drain. Pat dry in paper towels. Season the duck cavity with salt and pepper, add a third of the prepared orange peel, and truss the duck. (Roast according to the master recipe in Mastering the Art of French Cooking p. 274) While duck is roasting, make a sweet and sour caramel coloring as follows: Boil the sugar and vinegar over moderately high heat for several minutes until the mixture has turned into a mahogany-brown syrup. Immediately remove from heat and pour in 1/2 cup of the duck stock. Simmer for a minute, stirring to dissolve caramel. Then add the rest of the stock, beat in the arrowroot micture, and stir in the orange peel. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes or until the sauce is clear, limpid, and lightly thickened. Correct seasoning and set aside. Cut the 4 oranges into neat, skinless segments (or supremes) and place in a covered dish. When the duck is done, discard trussing strings, and set it on a platter. Place it in the turned-off hot oven, leaving the door ajar. Remove as much fat as you can from the roasting pan. Add the wine and boil it down rapidly, scraping up coagulated roasting juices and reducing the liquid to 2 or 3 tablespoons. Strain the wine reduction into the sauce base and bring to the simmer.

Leave, covered for 1 hour for the flour to absorb all the liquid. Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Add the rest of the ingredients, except the glaze, and mix with vigour to ensure everything is spread evenly through the dough - this will be very sticky! Knead the dough on a clean work surface for between 5-10 minutes You can dip hands into a bowl of water at intervals to help with the kneading if necessary. Press the dough mixture intpo a well greased 2lb loaf tin. Make sure it's pushed right into the corners. Bake the loaf on the middle shelf for about 35 mins until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. When you have removed it from the oven, brush with glaze and return to oven for a couple of minutes to set the glaze. Let the bread stand in the tin for a few minutes, then invert onto a wire rack. This keeps very well and because it's made using rye it can be better for being left a couple of days before eating. (We never let it wait long though !).",

Slice the cheese into thinnish slices. Grate the cold potatoes using the coarse side of the grater. Using a large non stick frying pan (Large - so you can use it to fry the potato cakes afterwards). Fry the slices of pancetta until the fat turns golden. Then remove and set to one side. Season the potatoes with salt and pepper. Shape with your hands into flat patties - you should have enough to make about six. Melt the butter with the olive oil in the pan. When the butter starts to fizz, using a slotted metal slice, slide three of the potato cakes inches Be careful as you do that they don't spit. Cook over a moderate heat until they are golden underneath. Now carefully, so they don't break, turn them over. If they do break don't fuss just shape them best you can and carry on - they'll taste just as good. Cook until both sides are golden. Take them out and keep warm while you repeat with the remaining cakes. Return the cooked cakes to the pan. Divide the cooked pancetta between the cakes and lay the cheese on top. Cover the pan with a lid and continue to cook for a couple of minutes, until the cheese has melted. Serve immediately.",

Take out the bowl from Step 1, and with a whisk, mix the butter until it is well incorporated into the milk. Add the dry yeast and mix some more. Add 1/3 of the amount of flour, sugar, and salt, and mix until the batter is smooth. Add the remaining flour, and 1/3-1/2 the amount of beaten egg and mix with a chopstick (Save the remaining egg for later). Continue mixing with a chopstick, so the dough comes together. Once the dough from Step 5 has come together, cover with parchment paper, and microwave for 30 seconds at 150-200W (low). Allow the dough to rise. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Bubbles will form during this time. Use the parchment paper covering the dough to de-gas the dough with your hands. Divide the dough into your preferred portions, form them into balls and place on a sheet of parchment paper. Cover your dough from step 9 with a sheet of parchment paper and lay a damp, tightly wrung out kitchen towel on top. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes at room temperature. Leave the sheet of parchment paper on top and gently de-gas the dough with your hands.

Once homogenous, slowly pour in the milk, with the mixer running on low. When all of the milk has been added, it should become cohesive. Add the melted coconut oil, and beat until fully combined. With the mixer running, beat in the eggs one at a time, making sure each is thoroughly mixed in (no streaks of yolk!) before adding the next. Use a spatula to scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl, then beat on high speed for 3 minutes. You'll end up with a very smooth, thick mixture that's more reminiscent of cake batter. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel, and let rise for 1 hour. It won't exactly double, but it will puff up substantially. Then, use a spatula to gently scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl-this will take some of the air out of the batter. Grease an 8 1/2-inch by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan, and scoop the batter into the pan, using a wet spatula to level it as needed. Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rise somewhere warm for about an hour-when it's ready, the batter will be just peeking above the edge of the pan. (About 20 minutes before it's ready, heat your oven to 350°F.) Remove the plastic wrap and bake for 40 to 50 minutes, until golden brown. To cool, turn it out of the pan onto a rack.",

Turn the heat to very low and cover. Cook for about 30 minutes, at which point most of the port will have been absorbed. If the fruit is tender, its done. If not, add 1/2 cup water, bring to a boil again, cover, and cook for another 15 minutes. Repeat once more if necessary. Remove the fruit with a slotted spoon, then strain the liquid to remove the spices. Serve a portion of the fruit warm, cold, or at room temperature with a spoonful or two of its juice. Substitute almost any sweet or neutral liquid for the port: water, oloroso sherry, red wine (add a tablespoon of sugar), sweet white wine, orange juice, and so on. If you prefer less-than-sweet results, add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice at the end of cooking. Vary the spices. Try a tiny grating of nutmeg in place of the allspice, peppercorns, and star anise, for example. Some coriander seeds are also nice. Since the preparation of this dish is absolutely foolproof, the challenge (and most of the fun) lies entirely in the shopping, especially since there is an incredible variety of dried fruits available, much of it of superhigh quality. In the course of fine-tuning this recipe, I tried not only the obvious prunes, figs, apricots, peaches, and pears, but also cherries, blueberries, strawberries, pineapple, and even banana. I tend toward the traditional but really enjoyed the tartness that dried pineapple added to the mixture and encourage you to experiment and find the mix of fruits that suits you best.",

Partly cover and cook on high until fork tender. When cooked through, turn down to med-low, leave potatoes in the water and mash with potato masher until consistency of loose oatmeal. If you like a smoother texture use a immersion blender to puree. While potatoes are cooking saute onion on med-high heat until translucent and add garlic. Cook for one minute more then add ground beef, salt, and pepper. Once beef is cooked half way, add barley, stirring constantly for one minute. Now add 1/2 cup of water or broth to the mix. Stir occasionally to keep from sticking and to ensure even cooking. Continue to add water/broth while it absorbs (shouldn't take long and doesn't take all the liquid usually) until barley is al dente and meat is cooked through. Add meat mix to pot of sweet potato and stir well. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve with fresh bread and butter. ***This will thicken more as the barley continues to absorb liquid and release starch, so if you find it's too thick just add some water to thin out. I like mine a little thicker so i don't bother. When it's properly chilled it is quite firm (can be 'cut' into serving sizes from a container with a spoon) but will loosen up as it warms up.***.",

In a saucepan, whisk together the almond milk, 4 tablespoons of the sugar, and the corn syrup. Heat to a scald (tiny, uniform bubbles will form around the perimeter). In a stainless steel bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, the other 4 tablespoons of sugar, and olive oil. Set the bowl on a damp towel to stabilize it and slowly whisk in the hot mixture. Rinse out the pan in which you heated the almond milk and fill it with 3 inches of hot water. Return it to the stove over medium heat, set the bowl on it, and whisk until the custard cooks to 165° F. Remove the bowl from the heat and begin cooling it over an ice water bath. Whisk it frequently. Chill it to 40° F. Alternatively, chill overnight in the refrigerator. Stir in the amaretto once the custard has cooled. Assemble your ice cream machine with the frozen cylinder. With the motor running, pour the chilled custard into it. Allow to spin until it reaches the consistency of soft-serve ice cream, about 20 to 25 minutes. While the custard is spinning, make the ganache. Pour in the coconut milk into a saucepan and bring it just to a boil. Remove it from the heat and add the chopped chocolate. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, then stir until completely homogenous. Set the pan in an ice water bath, and cool the ganache while the custard is spinning. Also while the custard is spinning, spread the almonds out on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Preheat the oven to 350° F. Bake the almonds until toasted, about 7 minutes. Remove from the oven and place in the refrigerator to cool. Once cooled, about 10 minutes, pulse them briefly in a blender or food processor or chop them on a board with a knife to reduce them to about 1/4 of their original size. Place a stainless steel bowl in the freezer. When the custard is finished, scrape it into the chilled bowl. Quickly but gently fold in the toasted almonds. Pour the chilled ganache over the custard, and fold it into the custard in beautiful, big swirls. Cover the gelato with a sheet of plastic wrap pressed to its surface, and place it in the freezer.

Preheat oven to 450°F Line 2 jelly roll pans (low-sided baking pans) with foil; spray with a cooking oil spray, such as Pam. In a large bowl, combine the meats, eggs, soup mix, breadcrumbs and milk. Make sure it's very well mixed - you don't want to see streaks of turkey or beef. A stand mixer with a paddle blade on low speed makes quick work of it. At this point, you can form the meat mixture into one meatloaf and meatballs as I do, or all meatballs or two meatloaves as you wish. Meatloaf should be formed directly on a jelly roll pan. Shape it into an oval about 3\" high. Please don't use a loaf pan. Cooking it in a loaf pan will result in a steamed texture. Cooking it in an open pan will allow a nice brown crust to form. Spray top and sides of meatloaf with Pam. Put meatloaf into the oven and REDUCE oven temperature to 375°F Bake 45 - 60 minutes. Test for doneness with thermometer - 160°F. Remember, this contains poultry, it MUST be well done. When done, remove to a platter, slice and serve with gravy. To freeze, slice, allow to cool and wrap individual slices airtight. Thaw before re-heating. While the meatloaf starts cooking, form the rest of the meat mixture into 1\" meatballs. A small ice cream style scoop works well and makes uniform sized balls. Place the balls on a jelly roll pan. Spray meatballs with Pam and bake 30 - 40 minutes, turning after 20 minutes. Test for doneness (160F). Freeze meatballs on the pan, after they are frozen, remove to a ziptop freezer bag. To serve, combine gravy ingredients in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add frozen meatballs and simmer for 7-10 minutes, then drain and add to gravy. Good with noodles.",

    "4 cups (about 1/2 of a 12-ounce bag) dry coleslaw mix\n4 ounces cooked and chopped ready-to-eat shrimp\n1/2 cup canned sliced water chestnuts, drained and cut into strips\n1/4 cup bean sprouts, chopped\n2 scallions, chopped\n1 stalk celery, thinly sliced widthwise\n2 tablespoons reduced-sodium or lite soy sauce\n1 teaspoon crushed garlic\n1/4 teaspoon ground ginger\n1/8 teaspoon salt\nDash black pepper\n6 large square egg roll wrappers*\nSweet and sour sauce, for optional dipping\n*Can be found in the refrigerated section of the supermarket with the other Asian items. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Put slaw mix in a large microwave-safe bowl with 2 tablespoons of water, cover, and microwave for 2 minutes. Drain any excess water from the bowl. Add all of the other ingredients except the wrappers and optional sauce, mix well, and set aside. For a more intense flavor, allow the mixture to marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. Prepare a large baking sheet by spraying it lightly with nonstick spray. Place an egg roll wrapper on a clean, dry surface. Evenly distribute about 1/2 cup of the mixture onto the wrapper, in a row a little below the center. Moisten all four edges by dabbing your fingers in water and going over the edges smoothly. Fold the sides of each wrapper about 3/4 inch towards the middle, to keep the mixture from falling out of the sides. Then, roll the bottom of each wrapper up around the mixture, and continue rolling until you reach the top. Seal the outside edge with another dab of water. Carefully transfer egg roll to the baking sheet. Repeat the process with the remaining wrappers and filling, making sure you have a clean, dry surface each time. Spray the tops of the egg rolls with nonstick spray. Bake in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown. Allow them to cool slightly.

    "8 to 10 medium russet potatoes\n1 large brown onion\n2 tablespoons jarred minced garlic\n1 cup matzo meal\n4 large eggs\n1/2 cup vegetable oil\ncoarse kosher salt\n1 jar unsweetened apple sauce for serving\nPeel and quarter the potatoes and onions. Fit your food processor with the standard blade and place half of the potatoes and half of the onions in the food processor. (Grampa Stephen insists that no matter how big your food processor, batching is essential.) Pulse until the potatoes and onions are finely minced. Add 1 tablespoon of minced garlic and 2 eggs and pulse again. Add half the matzo meal in a circular motion covering the top of the mixture and pulse once more. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and start a second batch using the same steps 1 through 5. Heat 1 inch of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet. When oil is hot (just before it smokes) ladle 1/3 cup sized portions into the oil and cook until golden brown on the bottom. Once the bottom side is brown use a fork (yes, a fork!) to gently flip over the latke. (Grampa Stephen says that using a fork minimizes splashing and keeps the other latkes in the pan undisturbed.) When both sides are golden brown, lift the latkes from the pan with a slotted spatula and place on a paper towel to drain. Repeat the process with the remaining batter. Add more oil if necessary. When ready to eat, sprinkle the top of each latke with coarse kosher salt (to taste) and serve with a dollop of apple sauce.",

Put the almonds in a food processor and pulse a few times until they are coarsely chopped. Spread the almonds on a baking sheet. Bake until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Combine the cream and sugar in a pot over medium heat. Scrape out the seeds of the vanilla bean and add to the cream mixture; put the pod in there too for extra flavor. Simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar, until steam rises from the top of the pot. Remove from the heat and stir in the nuts and salt. Cover and let the nuts steep in the cream for 30 minutes. Soak the gelatin sheets in cold water for 3 minutes to soften, then remove and squeeze out the excess water (if using powdered gelatin, no need to strain out the water). Pass the almond mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids with the back of a wooden spoon to extract all of the almond flavor. Discard the solids. Add the softened gelatin while the mixture is still warm, stirring to incorporate. Stir in the buttermilk. Carefully fill 6 straight-sided rocks glasses halfway with the custard; pour carefully so you dont get schmutz on the sides of the glasses. Cover loosely and chill in the refrigerator until firm, at least 8 hours or, even better, overnight. To serve, set a couple of roasted pear wedges on top of each chilled panna cotta. Garnish with candied almonds. Preheat the oven to 400F. Coat a rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Using a vegetable peeler, peel the skin from the pears. Slice each pear into 6 wedges and carefully cut out the core with a paring knife. In a mixing bowl, combine the molasses, sugar, syrup, brandy, and vanilla. Add the pear wedges, tossing to coat. Dump the pears onto the baking sheet in a single layer. Roast for 20 minutes total, turning the pears with tongs halfway through cooking, until they are soft and brown. Remove from the oven and cool until warm. Save the caramel left on the baking sheet; its terrific drizzled on ice cream.",

    "3 tablespoons oil\n6 onions, sliced thin\n4 cups vegetable broth\n4 cups potatoes, cut into bite sized chunks\nHeat the oil in a pressure cooker (without lid) over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for quite a long time to caramelize. The exact timing will depend on how sweet your onions are. Mine weren't sweet at all so the process took about 40 minutes. The way to caramelize is to cook the onions slowly over medium heat - perhaps adding a bit of veggie broth if they start to stick to the pan. You're looking for a nice deep brown color both on the onions and on the pan- that's the sugar coming out of the onion. After the onions are nice and brown and the bottom of the pan is looking very brown add the potatoes. Stir and cook for about 5 minutes - to give the potatoes a bit of that nice roasted flavor. Cover with the veggie broth. Raise the heat to high and lock on the pressure cooker lid. Bring to high pressure, then immediately turn off the heat. Allow the pressure to reduce naturally. Remove lid. Using an immersion blender, blend the soup thoroughly. Serve immediately - maybe with some nice crusty bread.",

    "200 grams Bread (strong) flour\n20 grams Whole egg\n2 grams Salt\n20 grams Castor sugar\n3 grams Instant dry yeast\n110 grams Water\n15 grams Butter\n6 Aluminum foil baking cups (size 9)\n1/2 the recipe quantity \"Secret Apple Filling\"\n20 grams Walnuts\n10 grams Sliced almonds\n30 grams Powdered sugar\n1/2 tsp Water\nBring the butter and egg to room temperature. Toast the walnuts for 7 minutes in a 180C oven (no need to pre-heat). When the walnuts have cooled slightly, crush with your hands into fairly small bits. Strain the egg through a sieve. You will need 20 g for the bread dough, and the rest can be set aside for later. If you have a bread machine, put all of the ingredients into the bread pan and turn it on! (If kneading by hand, see.) In the meantime, make the filling. Work quickly. For this recipe, I would recommend cutting the apples into 5 mm-1 cm slices, as opposed to wedges. When the apples have cooled a bit, drain them well in a colander. When the bread maker finishes, do a \"finger check\" (coat your finger with flour and poke a hole in the dough. If it doesn't spring back, you know that the first rising is complete). If the dough springs back, it hasn't finished rising. Let it sit for about another 5 minutes. If the dough has shrunk, it means you have let it rise too much. There's nothing you can do about this, so it's best just to proceed to the next step, bearing in mind that your rolls might not turn out the greatest! Carefully take the dough out of the bread machine with a bench scraper. Punch down the dough. Shape the dough into a ball. Make it nice and smooth. Close the seam tightly on the bottom. Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 15 minutes. Place the dough seam-side up and, using a rolling pin, lightly mark the dough with a cross. Roll out the dough, but leave approx. 1 cm on either end un-rolled (this helps achieve an even thickness). Roll out the dough into a 25 cm square. (This is easiest if you work from the centre, leaving the top, bottom, and sides until the very end). Thoroughly drain the apple filling and spread it out on the dough, leaving 2 cm at the end furthest from you empty. Roll it up from the end nearest you. Close the seam tightly, as you did when making the dough. Cut the dough into 6 pieces with a bench scraper (start by cutting it in half, then cut each half into 3 pieces.) Spread out the aluminum foil baking cups and place a roll in each cup. Let rise once more, this time at 40C on your oven's 'bread rising' setting. This is what they look like after the second rising. Pre-heat the oven to 190C. While waiting for it to heat, brush the rolls with the leftover egg and top with sliced almonds and walnuts. When heated, pop them into the oven for 12 minutes. Adjust the baking time according to your oven. Take the rolls out of the oven and cool on a wire rack... Mix together the icing ingredients until thick (make sure not to over-mix or it'll be hard). Drizzle the icing on the rolls! Even if you just drizzle it on at random, these will look surprisingly professional when finished, so don't worry too much. And with that, you're done!",

Rhubarb will not be tender and cut pieces will be intact. Transfer contents to a bowl and put in refrigerator to cool for 30 minutes.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Open 1 box of crusts and unroll onto a flat, floured surface. Place one rolled out crust on top if the other and press firmly to seal together. You can use a homemade crust, but the end result should be about 3/16\" thick. Cut crust and press dough into 2-2 1/2\" diameter mini tart pan(s). Save excess dough. The pan I use has places for 12 mini tarts.  Use the beaten egg to apply an egg wash to the crusts in the pan. If desired, you can sprinkle raw or large crystal sugar on the edges of the tarts. Put filling in each of the tarts (3-4 pieces of rhubarb per tart). Bake until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling 20-30 minutes. Cool in tart pan on wire rack.

    "Spiced Turkey Sliders\n1/2 pound ground turkey\n1/2 tablespoon ground clove\n1 teaspoon cinnamon (I had Vietnamese cinnamon on hand)\nhearty pinches crushed red pepper\n1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano or Parmesan cheese\n1-2 tablespoons pale oil (I like grapeseed or extra virgin coconut oil)\nsalt\nCaramelized Onions &amp; Apples\n1 medium Granny Smith apple, sliced thin\n1 medium onion, sliced thin\n1-2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 cup water (approximate)\nsalt\nmini rolls or dinner buns\nIn a bowl, add first five ingredients and combine. Add a little salt. Be mindful of the amount you add because the cheese will add some saltiness. Take a handful of the ground turkey mixture and form into a small burger. Repeat. In a pan over high heat, add oil. Note: When pan is hot, a rippling pattern in the oil will appear...think low tide on a beach). Add slider to pan. Sear for 30-45 seconds then reduce heat to medium. Allow meat to continue cooking for about two to three minutes. Flip slider. Cook for one minute then cover to continue the cooking process. Cook until done. Remove from pan and set aside. Note: I like to add a small amount of water to create steam as it speeds up the cooking process slightly. Lack of patience rules. Reserve pan with brown bits for Caramelized Onions & Sauteed Apples. Using the same pan the sliders were cooked in, add oil over medium high heat. Add onions. Cook until they take on a little color. Reduce heat to low. Note: Try not to stir too much as constant stirring will delay the caramelization process. Add about 1/4 cup of water to lift up brown bits from bottom of pan. Continue to cook onions. When liquid cooks out of onions, add water where necessary. Onions should start to break down and become slightly jam-like. Approximately ten minutes. Add apples and cook the mixture a little longer to soften the apples. Approximately two to three minutes. Remove from heat. Place some of the onion and apple mixture on bottom half of bun or roll. Top with slider then add a little more of the mixture on top of the slider. Place the other bun half on top and dig in!",

Dice figs. Mix flour,sugar, and spices together in a thick based saucepan. Slowly add 1\\2 cup of boiling water to make a smooth paste. (Its important that you add the water last, or you will get lumps) Stir in apples, figs, and the remaining water. Add more water if necessary. (At this point I often throw in a spoonful of mixed peel, for a bit of extra zest, this is optional.) Bring to boil and then let simmer over a medium\\low heat with the lid on for ten minutes or until apples begin to soften. While the apples are cooking, preheat oven to 180C. To make the crumble: mix flour and sugar together, then add the butter. Mix with your fingers to get a nice crumble. Add more flour (by the teaspoon) if it is too sticky, more butter if it is too dry. Spread the cooked apple and fig into your pie\\baking dish and smooth it out. Sprinkle crumble mix evenly over the top. (I make this recipe using individual portions, so I get a nice thick layer of crumble. I also sprinkle some mixed peel on top) Bake in oven for 10-15 minutes, or until golden brown on top. Serve it hot or cold. It is also good with custard, cream, or ice cream.",

You should have about 2 cups. Heat oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook cauliflower, stirring often, until golden brown all over and charred in spots, 6-8 minutes. Remove from heat; season with salt and pepper. Let cool in skillet. Mix yogurt, mint, and lemon juice in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Season lamb shanks very generously all over with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Working in 2 batches, cook lamb shanks in a single layer, turning occasionally, until browned all over, 8-12 minutes per batch. As the shanks finish cooking, transfer to a large plate. Reduce heat to medium; add onions and garlic, cut side down, to the same pot and cook, tossing onions occasionally, until onions are browned in spots and garlic is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add cinnamon and crushed coriander and cook, stirring constantly, until spices are very fragrant, about 1 minute. Add harissa paste and cook, stirring often and scraping bottom of pot, until vegetables are coated and paste is slightly darkened in color, about 2 minutes. Add 7 cups water, stirring to release any bits stuck on bottom of pot. Season generously with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Return lamb shanks to pot and bring stew back up to a simmer. Cover with a lid, leaving slightly askew so steam can escape, and cook, adjusting heat to maintain a very gentle simmer and skimming foam from surface as needed, until meat is tender and easily pulls away from bones, 1 1/2-2 hours. Transfer lamb shanks to a cutting board and let cool 10-15 minutes; keep liquid at a simmer. Pull meat from bones and tear into bite-size pieces. Add bones back to pot as you go. Transfer meat to a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Simmer bones in broth, uncovered, until liquid is thick and very flavorful, 25-30 minutes. Remove from heat; add meat back to pot and let cool uncovered (bones and all) until no longer steaming. Cover pot and chill stew at least 12 hours (you can skip this step, but it will dramatically improve the flavor). Uncover stew and spoon off half to three-quarters of fat on the surface; discard. Gently reheat stew until barely simmering. Pluck out and discard bones. Taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed. Ladle stew into bowls and serve with Toasted Cauliflower Crumbs, Mint Yogurt, harissa, and olives, mint leaves, and/or preserved lemon as desired. Yogurt can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Stew can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.",

Drain and stir the noodles into the egg-cheese mixture, then refrigerate, tightly covered, overnight. (I think this step of preparing ahead was mainly for convenience. I have baked the pudding immediately, and it turns out lighter; the noodles don't absorb as much of the custard. Lightly butter a 9- by 13-inch baking dish. Preheat the oven to 350° F. To make the topping, toss together the corn flakes, melted butter, and cinnamon in a small bowl. To bake the kugel, pour the noodle mixture into the baking dish and sprinkle evenly with the topping.

Worcestershire sauce\n3 sprigs rosemary\n3 garlic cloves, crushed\n2 (2x1\") strips orange zest\nPlace salt and brown sugar in a medium bowl and work together with your fingers until incorporated. Place turkey on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. (If you don't have this setup, place your turkey on a V-shape rack set inside a large roasting pan.) Sprinkle dry brine all over outside and inside of turkey, patting to adhere and nudging some into crevices. You won't need all of the dry brine, but it's good to have extra since some of it will end up on the baking sheet as you season the turkey. Chill bird, uncovered, at least 12 hours and up to 2 days. Remove turkey from wire rack and rinse baking sheet and rack if needed (turkey will most likely release some liquid onto pan). Line baking sheet with 3 layers of foil and set rack back inside. Place turkey, breast side up, on rack and tuck wings underneath. Let turkey sit at room temperature 2-3 hours. Place an oven rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450°F. Using your fingers, loosen skin on breast. Work 4 Tbsp. butter under skin, spreading evenly over both breasts. Smear outside of turkey with another 4 Tbsp. butter. Tie legs together with kitchen twine and pour 1 cup water into baking sheet. Roast turkey, rotating pan halfway through, until skin is mostly golden brown all over, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cook vinegar, honey, Worcestershire sauce, rosemary, garlic, orange zest, and remaining 4 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until bubbling and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to lowest setting and keep glaze warm. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F and continue to roast turkey, brushing with glaze every 30 minutes and adding more water by 1/2-cupfuls as needed to maintain some liquid in baking sheet, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast near the neck registers 150°F (don't worry; the temperature will continue to climb while the bird rests), 65-85 minutes longer. Skin should be deep golden brown, shiny, and crisp. Transfer turkey to a cutting board and let rest at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour before carving.",

Put the heart, neck, and gizzard in a medium pan. Add a third of the onion, the carrot, celery, and bouquet garni, then add enough water to cover all the ingredients. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 2 hours. Fry the bacon over medium heat in a large skillet with a lid (do not cover) until brown, then remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Lower the heat, add the butter to the bacon fat, and when it has melted, add the remaining onions. Cook, stirring frequently, for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they soften. Finely chop the reserved goose liver, then add to the onions. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, then add the apples to the skillet. Cover the skillet and cook for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the apples have broken down and are very soft. Stir in the mashed potatoes, sage, thyme, and parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 400F/200C (Gas Mark 6). Wash and dry the goose thoroughly inside and out. Pull out any fat inside the cavity and reserve it to render later for cooking fat. Prick the skin of the goose all over with a fork, then rub salt all over the skin. Season the cavity with salt and pepper, then fill with the mashed potato-apple stuffing. Truss the goose with kitchen twine, binding the legs and wings close to its body. Put the goose into a heavy roasting pan large enough to hold it, with a little room around the sides, and roast it for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and draw off the rendered fat with a bulb baster or large spoon. (Reserve the fat for cooking.) Return the pan to the oven and decrease the temperature to 325F/160C (Gas Mark 3). Roast for about 2 1/2 hours more, drawing off rendered fat at least once more as it cooks. Test for doneness by pricking the thigh at its thickest point with a skewer. If the juices run clear, the goose is done; if theyre pink, roast for another 15 minutes, then check again Meanwhile, strain the giblet stock, discarding the solids, and set aside. When the goose is done, transfer it to a large serving platter to rest. Draw off any remaining fat, then set the toasting pan over 2 burners on the stove top. Deglaze with the stock, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Strain the gravy into a gravy boar or bowl. Carve the goose at the table. Serve with applesauce and the gravy.",
    "rice your choice, I used Texmati\n2 andouille sausage links\n1/2 chicken breasts\ncajun seasoning to taste\nbutter\nContinuing my soul food trend, I did a little research on the internet for what to do, and pulled this out of thin air. Proportions and such aren't all that important. Cook your rice. Heat your oven to 375°F/190°C. Place the chicken breast in a small baking dish and add water to half the depth of the chicken (this helps preserve the moisture). Bake until almost done, then remove from the water and cut up or shred. In the meantime, place andouille in a saucepan and cover with water. Heat to almost a boil, reduce heat to medium and allow to simmer for about 10 minutes, turning in the water about 7 minutes in. Remove from water, but don't throw out the water. Slice the sausages about a quarter inch/1 cm thick. Put two or four tablespoons of butter in a skillet and melt it on medium heat. Add the andouille and the chicken to the butter, add around 1/8 cup (25 cc) of the andouille boil water, and mix. Cover and stir once in a while. After about five minutes, use a slotted spoon to remove the sausage and the chicken from the pan; set these aside. Add a little more boil water from the andouille, and whisk in cajun seasoning to your taste and some flour. The mixture will start to thicken up. If it gets too thick, add more boil water. Let it simmer for a couple minutes, then add in the chicken and sausage and stir to coat. Scoop the gravy over some rice and enjoy.",

Make sure that if doing so, enough time is allowed for the eggs and sugar to expand voluminously. Put the egg yolks into a large glass or metal bowl. Add the sugar, do not ever allow raw egg yolks to sit with sugar on them, without being whisked immediately. Stir in the corn syrup, liqueur, and salt. Beat well. Put over a bowl of lightly simmering water. Beat for seven or eight minutes, or until light and well increased in volume. Remove from heat. Continue beating to room temperature. No longer use the mixer. Fold in the 1/2 cup almonds. Set aside. Whip the cold cream with vanilla until rather stiff, but not butter. Fold into the almond mixture until very little, or no white remains. Put into a 13x9 inch glass or china baking dish. Freeze at least four hours, covered with plastic film.

Heat oil in pan. Make sure to use a pan that is deep enough so that the wontons dont rest on the bottom when frying. Remove wonton wraps from packaging placing them so that they look like diamonds in front of you. Get small bowl of water to use for sealing edges of wrappers. Take 1/2-1 teaspoon of cream cheese and place in middle of wrapper and top with a piece of shrimp. Dip your finger in the water and run along edges of the wonton wrapper, then fold the wrapper over the shrimp/cream cheese, matching point to point. Helpful hint: Place filled wontons on wax paper to dry out for a couple of minutes. Then turn them over and let them dry on the other side for a couple more before frying. When oil is hot enough, place a few wontons in pan without overcrowding. Make sure not to overcrowd otherwise you will have them sticking together. Watch closely... Remember your shrimp has to cook, so if the skins get dark way too fast, turn the heat down some. Medium-high works the best. They only take about 1 1/2-2 minutes per side.

Food processor method:. Into a small bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt- whisk to mix evenly. Process the sugars for several minutes until very fine. Cut the butter into a few pieces and add it with the motor running. Add the peanut butter and process until smooth and creamy. Add the egg and vanilla extract and process until incorporated, scraping the sides of the bowl. Add the flour mixture and pulse in just until incorporated. Electric mixer method or by hand:. Soften the butter to a cool room temperature. In a small bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Whisk to combine. In a mixing bowl, beat the sugars until well mixed. Add the butter and peanut butter and beat for several minutes, until very smooth and creamy. Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat until incorporated, scraping the sides of the bowl. Gradually beat in the flour mixture just until incorporated. Both methods:. Scrape the dough into a bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or as long as overnight. Measure the dough into a 1 1/4-inch cookie scoop (2 level teaspoons) and roll it to shape 1-inch balls. Place the balls 1 1/2-inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. As soon as you roll each ball, use your index finger or the handle of a wooden spoon to make a depression going down almost to the cookie sheet in the center of each ball. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned and set. For even baking, rotate the cookie sheet front to back halfway through baking. Cool the cookies on the sheets for a few minutes or until firm enough to lift. Use a small angled metal spatula to transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely. If necessary, while the cookies are still hot, use the greased handle of a wooden spoon to deepen the depressions. Fill the centers with milk chocolate toppings. While the cookies are baking, prepare the chocolate topping, melt the chocolates. Whisk in the softened butter. The mixture will thicken immediately. Do not over whisk. Use a reclosable quart-size freezer bag with one corner cut off to pipe the chocolate into the centers the cookies. Allow the chocolate to set until firm before storing the cookies in airtight containers.",

Leave it in a covered container at room temperature. When it doubles, add:\r\n100g Manitoba flour\r\n25g brown unrefined sugar dissolved in 45g water\r\n*\r\nAnd repeat the procedure mentioned above. When it doubles, use it in the final croissants dough. This whole procedure for sweet starter takes about 1.5 day, depending on the room temperature and the strength of your starter. The sweet sourdough starter is not my invention, I learnt it at the Quest for sourdough event in Belgium last year, where there's the very first sourdough library in the world. It was introduced to me by Stefan Cappelle. See here: http://www.questforsourdough.com/sourdough/sweetsourdough Mix all the ingredients (except butter) into nice and smooth rather stiff dough, refrigerate in a container with a lid overnight.\r\nNext day leave the dough at room temperature for about 45 minutes (my kitchen is 21 °C).\r\nIn the meanwhile prepare the butter, beat it and roll to a thickness of 0.5 cm in a 21-cm square. It should be mouldable, if it's too soft, freeze it for 3 minutes. The dough and the butter should be the same temperature, not too soft and not too stiff. Roll the dough into a square bigger than the butter one, so you can wrap it in (see internet videos on how to lock in the butter square). Do 3 series of letter folds. Between each fold put the laminated dough in the fridge for about 30 minutes (wrap it in cling foil). If the dough resists, let it rest for about 10 minutes and then roll it. Always roll from the centre in each direction. Don't use too much flour, brush off excess. After the 3rd fold, wrap the dough in cling foil and refrigerate overnight. Next morning take it out, let it warm up (about 30-45 minutes), and roll it about 0.4cm thick, cut and roll to croissants.\r\nBrush with a mixture of 1 egg, half tea spoon of cream and a pinch of salt. Cover the pan with cling foil; it shouldn't stick to the croissants. Proof till puffy and about 2 times (2.5x) their original size. At 21 degrees Celsius it took about 8-9 hours. Brush again with the leftover egg-cream-salt mixture.\r\nPreheat the oven to 220 °C; bake first 5 minutes at this temperature (thank you very much for this advice, dear Ralph @breadworks_2)\r\nAfter that lower to 190 °C and bake until golden brown (in my oven it takes 25min but my oven is 15-years old). Leave to cool if you can wait, best served a bit warm. Enjoy your day and let's bake the world a better place!\r\nYou can find me on Instagram under sourdough_mania :)",

Add the beans and the garlic in a large pot of water and bring to a boil.After the water boils reduce heat and cook over medium heat for 1 to 11/2 hours until they are tender but still firm. While beans are cooking cut and cook bacon, till its fully cooked and set aside. In another frying pan add 2 cups of ham and 2 cups of chopped smoked sausage.*Both cut into small cubes. Brown the ham and sausage for about 7-10 minutes, and set aside. Add the can of beer to your beans before the they are fully cooked and let simmer till the beans become fully cooked. When the beans are fully cooked, add the all the remaining ingredients into the pot ( a whole bunch of chopped cilantro, diced jalapeno peppers, diced onions, diced tomatoes, cooked bacon, ham, and sausage) . Let the beans come to a boil after you add the remaining ingredients. This recipe will not need salt because there is already enough of that coming from your beer, bacon and ham and sausage. The secret is in the cilantro and the beer. The more cilantro and beer the more flavorful! *For those of you that don't eat pork, you can use turkey ham, turkey bacon and turkey sausage. The taste is just as flavorful.",
    "3 avocados\n1 -2 roma tomatoes or 2 -3 tablespoons canned chopped tomatoes\n12 finely chopped medium onion\n1 bunch cilantro, finely chopped\n1 pinch Worcestershire sauce\n1 pinch Tabasco sauce\n1 piece lime\n14 teaspoon salt\nOpen up the avocado and slice in 1/2. Squeeze some lime juice onto the face of each half, and then add some salt. Pick up the first half, and slice pieces with a knife in a criss cross pattern (careful not to cut into the avocado peel). Then scoop the pieces into a mixing bowl with your fingers. Repeat with all avocados. Make sure to put 1 pit in the bowl. A friend from Costa Rica taught me this, and for some strange reason this helps the guacamole to stay fresh longer. Then mash the pieces of avocado with a fork, and stir in the other ingredients. Be careful not to add too much Worcestershire or Tabasco sauce - you really just need a few drops of each. The lime and salt amounts above are not fixed - just add a little, taste it, and add a bit more until it tastes right to you. Stir the other ingredients all up and you have yourself some tasty Guac! Variations: sometimes I use salsa when I don't have fresh tomatoes, or chopped Rotel or something similar from a can. I like the glass jar of Salsa Casera, or the Embasa small can. You can also add garlic, or top with parmesan cheese. Note: the portions for ingredients are estimates! You have to use your own discretion a bit ;).",

    "4 Cadbury Creme Eggs\n1 egg, beaten\n1/2 cup flour\n8-12 cups of vegetable or peanut oil, quantity depending on your pan\n1 cup flour\n1 tablespoon cocoa powder\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup milk\n1 tablespoon white vinegar\n1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil\n1 1/2 cups vanilla wafers, crushed (I used Teddy Grahams)\nStart out by unwrapping your Cadbury Creme Eggs. Freeze them for at least 2 hours, or even overnight-you want them to be like little rocks. Near the end of the chilling period, get yourself set up. Have three shallow bowls handy: one with 1/2 cup of the flour, one with the beaten egg, and one containing the crushed vanilla wafers. Also get out a larger bowl, for mixing your batter. Now, it's time to start heating the oil for frying. I poured about 6 cups of vegetable oil into a medium saucepan, so that it was about 4-5 inches deep. The exact quantity of oil required will depend on the size of your saucepan. Turn the heat to medium-high, and insert a candy or frying thermometer. The oil needs to reach 375°F on the thermometer, which will take about 10-12 minutes. While the oil heats, prepare the batter. Place 1/2 cup of flour in a shallow bowl and set aside for the moment. Place 3/4 cup of flour in a small bowl and stir in the cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. In a mixing cup, stir together the milk, vinegar, and oil. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry until smooth and free of most lumps. The batter should be thicker than a pancake batter-if it seems too liquidy (as if it might drip off when you dip the Cadbury Creme Eggs in it), whisk in the remaining flour until it has reached the desired consistency. Remove the Cadbury Creme Eggs from your freezer. I found that it is best to fry one cupcake at a time, so you could take them out of the freezer a couple at a time so that the eggs fried later on don't get too warm while sitting out. Using a spoon, coat an egg with the batter mixture. Use floured hands to mold the batter around the egg so that every bit is covered. First, dredge the battered Creme Egg in the flour, covering it completely. Tap off excess. Now, coat the floured ball with the egg wash. Roll the egg wash coated ball in the cookie crumbs, coating on all sides. Using a slotted spoon, gently ease the crumb-coated orb into the hot oil. Once the batter has reached a pleasing golden hue (a minute or less), remove the Cadbury Creme Scotch Egg from the oil and transfer to a plate covered with paper towel to soak up the excess grease. Repeat the battering and frying process with the remaining Cadbury Creme Eggs, battering and coating them one at a time directly before dipping in the frying oil. While frying, be sure to monitor the temperature of the oil and adjust your heat up or down accordingly so that it remains at 375°F. If the oil is too cold it won't fry quickly enough and the chocolate eggs will soak up too much grease; if it is too hot, the outside will get dark before the inside is fully warmed, leaving you with a delicious shell but a still gooey batter on the inside. Eat while still warm.",

Next, I added the chicken stock and crushed tomato and tomato paste. Lastly, I added the bay leaf and lime juice. I let this simmer over medium heat for about 8-10 minutes. Add salt to taste. While the soup was simmering, I lined a small cookie sheet with foil. I then took the corn tortillas and with a pastry brush, brushed them with canola oil. I cut them into slices and lined them on the cookie sheet. I baked until nice and golden brown on a 400 degree oven. Next I added the soup and all of the veggies into the blender and mixed on high speed until the soup was nice and silky. Be sure you remove the bay leaf before doing this.

    "1 Tart Crust\n60 grams Cream cheese\n20 grams Granulated sugar (fine)\n1 Egg yolk\n10 grams Milk\n20 grams Granulated sugar\n30 Lemon juice\n2 grams Gelatin leaves\n1/2 a lemon Grated lemon skin\n100 grams Heavy cream (47% fat)\n1 Fruits for topping\nPrepping the pie crust: roll out the crust until 4 mm thick. Cut using a round cookie cutter with jagged edges (or simply a round cutter). Bake for approximately 18 minutes in an oven preheated to 180C preheated. (Please adjust baking time to your oven.) Prepping the lemon mousse: microwave the cheese for approximately 30 seconds to soften. Add granulated sugar and knead. Into a separate bowl, combine ingredients and mix well with a whisk. Soak the gelatin leaves in ice-cold water. Put the mixture from Step 4 into a pan. Heat over low to medium heat and stir as you heat. Once thickened as shown in the photo, remove from the heat. Add gelatin into the pan and dissolve. Then add that into the lemon mousse mixture from Step 3. Mix well with a whisk until completely smooth. Add the grated lemon skin at this stage. Whip the heavy cream until it forms soft peaks. Combine the whipped cream and the lemon mousse mixture. Mix well to finish the batter. Put that into a piping bag. Squeeze the batter into half-oval molds. When done, smooth out the surface with a palette knife. Freeze to harden. To remove from the mold, prepare a bowl of hot water. Stick a fork into the mousse and warm the bottom with the hot water bath. After it's slightly warmed and molten, spin the fork gently to remove them. Top the mousse on top of the tart crusts. Decorate with lots of fresh fruit around the mousse. Sift some powdered sugar on top to finish. It's a delicious cheese mousse with some nice lemon flavor.",

They won't blend well with chocolate if you don't chop them finely enough. Roughly crack or chop the chocolate and melt in the microwave. (40 seconds30 seconds20 seconds at 700w) Note Cooking time may vary depending on your microwave. Even if it is still lumpy, it will melt with the residual heat. Don't melt it too much. Pour the melted chocolate into Step 1 and mix well. Place the mixture on parchment paper, shaping it into a log. It's easier to roll on a bamboo sushi mat. Roll and adjust the shape and twist to secure both ends ('candy' wrap). Leave it in a cool place or chill in the fridge for 30 minutes to let it harden. When it's hard, open the wrapping and sprinkle with cocoa powder (powdered sugar). When you store it, wrap with aluminum foil over the parchment paper (not in a 'candy' wrap) so that the paper won't tear easily. When you eat, take it out of the fridge and leave it at room temperature for a while before you cut it. It is very hard to cut and crumbles when it is cold. You can keep it at room temperature, but not in a warm place.",

Combine all the ingredients for the sauce in a small bowl. This can be done up to 24 hours in advance and kept in the refrigerator, but should be done at least 15 minutes before serving to allow flavors to blend. 3. Slice the potato into very thin matchsticks. For best results, soak the matchsticks in a bowl of water to reduce the starch for about 20 minutes. Then drain and thoroughly dry potato sticks. This is recommended, but not necessary. 4. Heat a non-stick pan over medium low heat. Add the potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally until soft, about 7 minutes. 5. When potatoes are soft, turn the heat up to medium high and allow potatoes to brown, stirring only occasionally to allow them to brown evenly on all sides. 6.

In a pan over low heat, melt butter, milk chocolate, dark chocolate and golden syrup. Once melted, set aside 100ml of the melted chocolate mixture to be used later. Leave the rest in the pan but turn off the heat. Crush biscuits into small pieces and fold into the chocolate mixture in the pan. Chop the cherries into halves or thirds depending on their size and add to the pan. Mix in raisins and mini marshmallows. Lay out the baking parchment onto a tray (20cmx15cm) and spoon the mixture onto it. Press down firmly on the mixture to compress and form an even layer. Pour the reserved 100ml of melted chocolate evenly across the top of the mixture. The idea is to fill in any gaps with it, and create a slightly smoother top surface. The liquid should only just cover all of the surface, so you may need to spread it with a spoon to distribute it evenly. Put it in the fridge to set. It will be set enough to eat in about 2 hours, but I prefer to leave it overnight to give it enough time to fully harden.",

Add the butter, egg yolks, vanilla extract, cinnamon and nutmeg into the well. Knead the dry and wet ingredients with your hands until well-blended and the butter is thoroughly incorporated into the mix. Prepare a springform pan by lining it with parchment paper. Take roughly 3/4 of the dough and spread it all uniformly across the bottom of the springform pan. It should be at least 1/2 an inch thick, with a slight lip around the edges. Combine the jam and brandy in a mixing bowl, then spread across the dough in the springform pan. The lip of the dough should still be higher than the jam; if not, use a little of the remaining dough. Divide the rest of the dough into thin strips, and place them across the top of the dough, forming a lattice from edge to edge. Bake the torte in a 375-degree oven for 35 minutes, until the jam is bubbling a bit and the dough is starting to turn golden brown. Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes. Carefully peel down the edges of the parchment paper away from the edges. Sprinkle the top of the torte with confectioner's sugar.",

I used a Cuisinart ice cream maker with capacity of 1 1/2 quarts. Note that the ice cream maker bowl should be frozen for at least 16 to 24 hours prior to starting the ice cream. Also, the toasted pecans and ice cream base should be chilled in advance. In a medium non-stick skillet over medium-low heat, melt butter. Add pecans and salt. Cook over low to medium heat until pecans are toasted and golden, stirring frequently, for about 8 minutes. Remove from heat, strain and reserve pecans. Let them chill in the refrigerator. Discard butter or keep for another recipe (perhaps over pancakes, waffles or in cookies). In a medium bowl whisk to combine the milk and sugar until sugar is dissolved. Add the heavy cream and vanilla. Cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours or overnight. (I was short on time and since my ingredients were pretty cold, I did not refrigerate them for 1-2 hours.) Turn on the Cuisinart ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions and insert the frozen bowl. Pour the cream mixture into the frozen bowl and let it mix until thickened, about 20 minutes. Five minutes before mixing is completed, add the pecans and let them mix in completely. This ice cream is soft and creamy. If a firmer consistency is preferred, transfer to an airtight container and place in the freezer for 30 minutes before you serve it.",

Add the powdered sugar and whip on medium-high speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until soft peaks form. (Test for soft peaks by pulling the beaters straight up. The cream should pull up with the beaters and form a peak, and when it releases, the tip should fold over and be slightly soft.) Spoon the whipped cream over the custard and refrigerate the pie until you are ready to serve it. The process of whisking a little hot liquid into the eggs is called tempering the eggs. This is necessary whenever you are adding eggs to a hot liquid. Tempering allows the eggs to slowly increase in temperature without cooking them. If the eggs were added directly to the hot liquid they would cook and you would end up with scrambled eggs floating in the half-and-half. Ice water baths are used to quickly cool foods to a safe temperature. Perishable foods, in this case the eggs and milk, should be kept below 40F or above 140F. Ice water baths shorten the time in the danger zone (between 41F and 139F) where bacteria growth can occur.",

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone liners. Place the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt into a sifter or fine-mesh strainer, then sift the mixture into a large bowl until it's all combined. Throw the butter pieces into the bowl and use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the dry ingredients. Measure the cream in a spouted measuring cup and crack in an egg. Zest one of the lemons and add the zest to the cream. Add half of the rosemary to the mixture. Whisk together, then drizzle it into the flour-butter mixture, stirring gently with a fork until combined and a dough forms. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and lightly press it together until it forms a rough rectangle. Use a rolling pin to roll into a rectangle about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch thick. Use your hands to help with the forming if necessary. The final rectangle should be about 18 inches by about 10 inches. Use a knife to trim the dough into a symmetrical rectangle, then cut the rectangle into 12 symmetrical square/rectangular pieces. Next, cut each piece in half diagonally to form smaller triangles. Transfer the triangles to the prepared baking sheets. Bake until just barely golden brown, about 18 minutes, then allow to cool completely.

Lightly butter the English muffins and place them under the broiler for just a few minutes, or until the English muffins are very lightly golden. Next, poach the eggs. With a spoon, begin stirring the boiling water in a large, circular motion. When the tornado's really twisting, crack in an egg. Or two. Or three. The reason for the swirling is so the egg will wrap around itself as it cook, keeping it together. Cook for about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. In a small saucepan, melt 1 1/2 sticks of butter until sizzling. Place the yolks into a blender. Turn the blender on low to allow the yolks to combine, then begin pouring the very hot butter in a then stream into the blender.

They will go from brick red to almost black. The warm fragrant aroma that simply dry roasting these dried chilies will leave in your kitchen is to die for. Let them cool and then snap off the stems. Using your food processor, place onions, cilantro, peeled garlic, tomatoes and roasted chilies in the bowl. Start with 7-8 chilies and if you find you want a hotter heat, add them accordingly. Pulse until well blended. Add about a teaspoon of kosher salt. Pulse to blend. Taste. Adjust the salt. If you find this heat is too whimpy, break up another 1-3 chilies and pulse again until smooth. I find that 8-9 chilies, depending on how hot the chilies are, is a good start. This is my salsa base. Variations: For medium heat, finely chop some onion and fresh tomato and add to a bowl. Add a few tablespoons of the hotter salsa base. Mix well. Voila! Medium chunky salsa. For mild heat, prepare the medium salsa above, add 1/2 1 whole can (14.5 oz. can) of tomato sauce. Mix well and there you have it. 3 salsas from one base. Tip:dry roast 20-25 Arbol chilies at once. Leftover chilies can be stored in baggies or other airtight container.

Stir eggs in their container over warm water until tepid; microwave sugar and flour for a few seconds until tepid. Bring out all ingredients and equipment and measure 1 TB. of flour into a small bowl; set aside. Put eggs in a mixing bowl with the sugar and flour and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon to blend into a heavy cream. (At this point I add as much of the 3rd egg as needed). Set aside for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, melt all the butter in a saucepan and boil until it begins to brown very lightly. Blend 1 1/2 TB. browned butter into the bowl with the tablespoon of flour and reserve. Stir the rest of the browned butter over cold water until cool but still liquid. Add the cooled butter to the batter and stir in salt, vanilla, grated lemon, and lemon juice (and bergamot if using). Cover batter and set aside for 1 hour (or longer if necessary). Paint the madeleine cups with a thin layer of the butter/flour mixture. Wipe up any pools forming in the bottom of the cups; set aside (refrigerate in hot weather). Preheat oven to 375. After its hour long rest the batter will be a bit stiff. Using a spoon and rubber spatula, dislodge a rather generous tablespoon lump of batter into each Madeleine cup, but do not spread it out....it must stay in a lump in the middle of the cup. Bake in the middle level of preheated oven about 15 minutes; batter will spread out to fill the cups and will gradually swell up into a hump. The Madeleines are done when lightly browned around the edges and when they begin to shrink slightly around the edges. Unmold onto a rack, humped side up. Serve as is, or sprinkle tops with a dusting of powdered sugar. When cool, wrap airtight and freeze if not to be served promptly. Best when eaten the same day. Makes 24 Madeleines. Bon appetit!",

Cool to lukewarm. Dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir until dissolved, then stir into the lukewarm milk mixture. Add beaten eggs and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth and stir in an additional 2 cups flour. Turn dough out onto lightly floured board and knead until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl and brush top with vegetable oil. Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from draft, until double in bulk (about 1 hour). Punch down and turn out onto lightly floured board. Cut into 2 rounds or 4 to make smaller loafs. Roll out one dough into a rectangle about 12x9. Spread 1 can of filling within 1 inch of sides. Roll up long side into a roll. Pinch seams tight so no filling escapes. You can use egg slightly beaten to seal. I always have poppy seed escape. A Hint if you want it to keep the shape of the roll place it in parchment paper securing the seams of the parchment and make sure the seam of the dough is down. I prefer to bake in loaf pans as you see in the pictures I posted here. Place on pan and let rise 1 hour until doubled. Bake in a preheated oven at 425°F for 30 minutes. Until nicely browned. Remove parchment if using and let cool. You can top with a powdered sugar glaze or slice and spread some sweet butter on it.

Cover with 2 cups flour add butter and salt top with the rest of the flour and sugar. Make a small indent in the flour and place yeast in (Using 2 1/2 teaspoons Rapid Rise Active yeast for bread machines). Set on dough cycle and let process for a bit if it needs more water slowly add. Then follow with rolling and filling as above. I found that the last rising was 15 minutes with this method!",

    "1 bag of chocolate chips\n1 large glass, microwave-safe bowl\nSpoon\nMicrowave\nPour the chocolate chips into the microwave safe bowl and place them in the microwave.  Set the microwave for the half or 50 percent power level. This is important because the chocolate will burn if cooked on full strength.  Run the microwave at half strength for 40 seconds. Take the bowl out and stir the chocolate well.  Repeat Step 3 until the chocolate is just melted. Once it is melted do not heat longer as it will burn. Use the chocolate quickly before it hardens.  TIPS AND WARNINGS Always remember to stir well between each 40 seconds of heating. The total time needed to melt the chocolate will vary from microwave to microwave. To keep the chocolate from hardening as quickly once melted, add a few drops of vegetable oil. The chocolate may be a little softer when hardened if you do this, but it is easier to bite into. To harden candies quickly, place a tray of chocolate coated candies in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Chocolate easily burns. When heated too long it clumps together and makes an unusable mess. Make sure the microwave is always on half strength when heating the chocolate.",

    "2 (14 ounce) cans light coconut milk\n2 tablespoons coconut cream\n6 tablespoons pure maple syrup\n2 tablespoons rum\n1 teaspoon real vanilla\n12 teaspoon sea salt\n25 raw almonds\n14 cup unsweetened coconut\nBe sure your ice cream bowl has been in the freezer for at least 48 hours so you know it's frozen solid. Slap almonds into small pieces. I use a slapper and it works great. Put almonds and coconut spread out onto a baking sheet and bake for 10 min or so at high heat (I use the broiler) watching and stirring as needed until they are toasted and the smell drives you crazy. Attempt not to snack on toasted almonds and coconut. In a good sized bowl, mix together coconut milk, coconut creme, syrup (I did this to taste), rum, and vanilla. Taste to make sure it is sweet enough. I added 4 tbs of maple syrup and then 2 more so it was sweet enough. Mix in salt, I like pink Himalayan sea salt. Set nuts aside to cool. Do not snack on nuts. Okay, one small one and one small piece of coconut but no more! If you have time, refrigerate your liquid mixture for a few hours. I actually put my milk into the fridge the night before. Pour into ice cream freezer and mix as directed. Do not add coconut or nuts yet. It should take 30 or so minutes to get to the frozen stage. When it's just about there, toss in your nuts and most of the coconut, but reserve a bit to sprinkle over the fresh ice cream when you serve it. Freeze a few hours or so until it's at the stage that you want. If you freeze it overnight, take it out at least 10 min before serving so it can loosen up a bit.",

    "250 grams water\n7.5 grams low-methoxyl pectin (we use 18CG from Le Sanctuaire; see Sources, page 309)\n1 cantaloupe\n1 honeydew melon\n2 grams fine sea salt\nCalcium lactate (see Sources, page 309)\nPut the water in a small pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Pour the hot water into a blender and carefully turn the blender on low. Increase the speed until a vortex forms; then slowly sprinkle the pectin into the water. Make sure the lid is secure and increase the speed. Blend for 5 minutes. Pour into a small bowl and reserve until needed. Skim off and discard any foam that may collect on the surface. Cut the top and bottom off of each melon. Stand them on end and carefully cut away the exterior skin and rind from top to bottom. Cut into quarters and scrape the seeds and juices into a small bowl. Trim each melon quarter into as thick a plank as possible with flat sides. Place all the melon trimmings in the bowl with the seeds; set the bowl aside. Season the planks lightly with salt. Put each melon plank into separate vacuum-seal bags and seal on high pressure. This process will weaken the cell walls and allow for the calcium to penetrate the fruit. Put the melon seeds, juices, and trimmings in a blender and turn on low to begin breaking up the flesh. Increase the speed to medium so that the juices are released and the seeds remain intact. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer, pushing on the solids to extract the juice. Weigh this liquid and calculate 0.5 percent of its weight. Weigh out that amount of calcium lactate. Put the juices into a clean blender and add the calcium. Turn the blender on medium speed and blend for 2 minutes to disperse and dissolve the calcium. Turn off the blender and reserve the juice. Cut open the vacuum bags and divide the melon between two new vacuum bags. Add the calcium-enriched melon juice and vacuum seal the bags. You may not need all the juice. Let the melon infuse for 5 minutes. Cut open the bags and remove the melon planks. Pat them dry and lay them out in a row. Use a pastry brush to apply the pectin to the honeydew planks and then place a cantaloupe plank on top of each. Place the stacked melon planks in vacuum bags and seal on high pressure. The vacuum sealing will apply a uniform pressure on the melons and keep them together so they will glue tightly. Place the bags in the refrigerator for several hours or ideally overnight. Once the melon has had time to set, cut open the bags, remove the melon, and trim the planks to make clean, sharp edges. At this point you will have four rectangles of two-melon terrine. The terrine may be diced or sliced and even gently warmed in the oven or on a grill before serving.",

Season to taste with salt and pepper then cover and store in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve.  To make the chicken nuggets: Pour oil into a large Dutch oven to a depth of about 2 inches and set the pot over medium-high heat. Heat the oil until it reaches 370-375 F on a candy thermometer.  Meanwhile, add the flour, confectioners' sugar, salt, pepper and paprika to a large reasealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake to combine. Add the chicken to the bag, then seal and shake again until all of the chicken is evenly coated. Use tongs to transfer about 8-10 pieces of chicken at a time to the hot oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the nuggets are golden brown and cooked through. I stirred mine around a bit with my spider strainer but wasn't particular about flipping them individually. The cooking time will depend on the size of your pieces - you can cut one open to double check.  Remove the chicken from the oil and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Continue to fry the chicken in batches until it's all cooked. Adjust the heat under your pan to maintain the oil temperature.  Serve with the honey mustard sauce.",

    "1 1/2 cups warm water\n1 teaspoon yeast\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 tablespoons sugar\n3 1/2 cups flour\nIn a large bowl, combine water, yeast, sugar, and salt. Let sit five to ten minutes. Stir in the first cup and a half of flour with a heavy spoon. Add the rest of the flour a little at a time as needed, stirring until dough becomes too stiff to continue stirring easily. Next, add a little more flour and begin kneading. Keep adding flour and kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic ( It doesn't need a lot more flour, just enough so that it's not sticking to the pastry board). Let dough rise in a greased bowl covered with a damp, clean kitchen towel until doubled. (Usually, about thirty minutes to an hour.). Uncover bowl, sprinkle in a little more flour and knead again. With floured hands, shape dough into a ball and place in a greased 3 1/2-quart crock pot. Turn the crock pot on High. (The bread will rise as the crock pot heats up.). Keep the lid just barely off the pot to keep steam from building up and making your crusty soggy. (Try using a toothpick to keep the lid open just a bit). Cook it for one hour on the first side. Dump the bread out onto a wire rack. Turn over and put it back in the crock pot and cook for another hour, covered with the lid just barely off. Turn out onto wire rack to cool.",

    "2 tablespoons slivered almonds\n13 cup plus 1/2 cup sugar\n3 tablespoons water\n2 ripe but firm Bosc or D'Anjou pears\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened\n1 egg\n23 cup flour\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon almond extract\nWhipped cream\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter an eight-inch round cake pan but do not use one with a removable bottom. Toast the almonds until lightly browned under the broiler, in a toaster oven or in a heavy ungreased skillet on the top of the stove. Set aside. Swirl one-third cup of the sugar with the water in a heavy saucepan or skillet until the sugar dissolves. Place over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture turns a uniform honey-brown color. Pour the caramel into the cake pan, tilting it so the caramel coats the bottom. Immediately scatter the almonds over the caramel. Peel and core the pears. Cut them into thin, uniform slices and arrange the slices, overlapping, in a pattern on top of the caramel and almonds. Cream the butter with one-half cup of sugar. Beat in the egg. Sift the flour and baking powder together and stir into the batter. Add the almond extract. Spread the batter over the pears in the cakepan. There will be a thin layer of batter. A spatula moistened in cold water will make spreading it easier. Place in preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes. Remove from oven, allow to cool for a minute or two, run a knife around the edge, then unmold onto a serving dish. If any of the topping clings to the pan, lift it off and replace it on the cake. Serve the cake while still warm with whipped cream.",
    "2g\n152ml water\n4g\n4g Diamond Crystal kosher salt; use the same weight for table salt or other kinds of salt\n364g King Arthur bread flour (see note)\n32g King Arthur whole wheat flour\n4g\n(see note)\nPotato starch or cornstarch, for dusting noodles\nAdd baked baking soda to water and stir to dissolve completely, about 30 seconds. Add potassium carbonate to water and stir to dissolve completely, about 30 seconds. Add salt and stir until dissolved completely. Set alkalized water aside. Combine bread flour, whole wheat flour, and vital wheat gluten in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Process until thoroughly mixed, about 30 seconds in a food processor or 1 minute on low speed in a stand mixer. With the machine running, add 1/3 of the alkalized water at a time, allowing enough time (about 1 minute) between additions for the liquid to be fully absorbed. After the final addition, allow machine to run until mixture looks pebbly and easily forms a ball when compressed in your hand, about 2 to 3 minutes. Lay a 3- to 4-foot-long sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface. Spread pebbly dough mixture out onto plastic wrap to form a rough 6-inch by 2 1/2-foot rectangle. Using your hands or fists, and using the plastic wrap to help you corral any bits of dough, compress loose dough into a single plank with a height of no more than 1/2 cm (1/4 inch). Wrap tightly in plastic wrap, using more wrap if necessary, and place in refrigerator for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours. When ready to roll out and knead dough, remove dough from refrigerator and let sit, wrapped, at room temperature for 30 minutes. In the meantime, set up a stand mixer fitted with the pasta-rolling attachment, or a manual pasta-rolling machine. Unwrap sheet and, using a bench scraper or knife, divide dough into 4 even portions; cover with plastic to prevent dough from drying out. Set stand mixer speed to medium-low, then check that the pasta-roller attachment is set to its widest setting. You'll want to be extra careful that the setting is right; using a setting that's too thin for the dough can result in the rollers getting knocked out of alignment or breaking altogether. Feed one portion of dough through rollers, applying pressure to ensure it passes evenly through. If it passes through in one piece, run the resulting piece through the second-widest roller setting, then cover in plastic to prevent drying and set aside. If the dough breaks up into many flattened pieces, place the flattened pieces on your work surface and press them into something that resembles a sheet, then pass it through the rollers again. Run the resulting piece through the second-widest roller setting, then set aside. Repeat the process from step 7 with another portion of the dough. Stack the 2 rolled sheets of dough on top of each other, then run them together through the widest setting of the pasta roller, followed by the second-widest setting, followed by the third-widest setting. Fold the dough sheet in half, making it half of its original length. Press down on the seam to flatten it, then run the sheet seam side first through the second-widest setting, followed by the third-widest setting. The dough should now feel cohesive and strong, not pebbly or grainy. Fold dough sheet in half again, making it half its original length. Press down on the seam to flatten it and cut off both corners of the seam diagonally, so that the dough sheet fits easily into the rollers. Run the sheet seam side first through the widest setting of the pasta rollers, then through the next-widest setting, then through the next-widest setting, and finally again through the next-widest setting. Fold in half lengthwise, press down on the seam, cut off the corners, and repeat the process. If this is done correctly, longitudinal lines will form on the sheet of dough. If you do not see these longitudinal lines, repeat the process until they appear-they are an indication that the gluten has been properly developed. Wrap dough sheet in plastic wrap or place it, folded, in a zipper-lock bag, then repeat the process with the remaining 2 portions of dough. Let dough sheets rest for at least 30 minutes before proceeding. Working with 1 dough sheet at a time, fold sheet in half, press down on the seam, cut off the corners of the seam, then run the sheet seam side first through the widest setting of the rollers, then through progressively narrow settings on your pasta machine, until it reaches the thickness you desire (~1 to 1.5 mm). Run the final dough sheet through the spaghetti-cutting attachment. Dust noodles with potato starch or cornstarch to prevent sticking, shake off excess starch, and fold noodles into loose nests. Place noodles in a zipper-lock bag, seal almost completely, and refrigerate at least overnight, but preferably for 4 to 7 days. (The noodles can be used immediately, but they will improve significantly in texture and flavor if allowed to age slightly; leaving the bag partially open allows moisture to evaporate and the noodles to dry properly at a slow rate.) Bring a large pot of unsalted water to a rolling boil over high heat. If using noodle baskets, add noodles to baskets and plunge into water, rapidly stirring noodles with tongs or chopsticks to prevent sticking. If not using noodle baskets, add noodles directly to boiling water and stir vigorously with tongs or chopsticks to prevent sticking. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 2 minutes. (The exact cooking time will depend on your preferences for doneness and on the thickness of the noodles; see note.) Drain thoroughly, shaking off as much excess water as possible, and add to hot ramen broth for serving.",
    "Wrapper\n1 1/2 cups flour\n1/2 cup boiling water\n1 tablespoon vegetabble oil\nFilling\n1 1/2 pounds pig feet\n2 cups water\n1/2 cup Shaoxing cooking wine\n1 piece fresh ginger (1 inch long)\n2 pieces scallion\n8 ounces ground pork\n4 ounces crabmeat\n2 tablespoons finely chopped scallion\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper\nPrepare the pig feet gelatin a day ahead by boiling all the ingredients together in a pot. Skim any scum that forms on top of the broth and slowly simmer for about an hour or until the liquid is reduced to about one cup. Drain and filter the broth through a fine sieve. Refrigerate the broth overnight and it will solidify. Alternatively a chicken broth gelatin can also be used. Melt one packet (1/4 ounce) of gelatin in one cup of hot Chinese chicken stock and refrigerate overnight. In a bowl mix the flour and oil then add the boiling water. Mix quickly with a pair of wooden chopsticks or a wooden spoon. When the mixture is cool to the touch start kneading the dough. If the dough is too dry add a little bit of extra warm water. Knead the dough until it is elastic and smooth. Set aside to let it rest. Mix all the stuffing ingredients together and set aside. When making the dumplings work with half of the stuffing at a time while keeping the rest in the refrigerator. If the stuffing is not kept cool the gelatin will melt. Divide the dough into two equal portions. Roll each portion into a cylinder about 1/2 inch in diameter. Cut the cylinder into pieces about 1/2 inch wide. Roll the pieces into balls. Roll the balls into round wrappers and fill with about 1 tablespoon of stuffing. Cup the wrapper in one hand, then with the other hand make small pleats along the edge all the way around and over the stuffing to form a seal. Steam the dumplings in a steamer for no more than five minutes. Serve the dumplings immediately with thinly shredded ginger and black vinegar.",
    "3 pounds (more Or Less) Unpeeled Shrimp (21-26 Count Or Larger)\n1/2 cups Olive Oil\nSalt And Pepper, to taste\n3 whole Lemons (juice Of)\n1/4 cups (to 1/2 Cup) Worcestershire Sauce\nTabasco\n1 stick Butter\nFirst, thoroughly rinse raw shrimp w/shells still on. I use 21-26 count (that means 21-26 shrimp per pound) but Ive certainly used bigger. Any smaller than this, and its difficult to peel, so stick with 21-26 or bigger. Place the shrimp in a large baking pan in a single layer. Over top of the shrimp drizzle about 1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil. Generously sprinkle black pepper over top of the shrimp. Be very generous! Now sprinkle generously with salt (I use kosher). Squeeze the juice of about 3-4 lemons over top of all of the shrimp. Now GENEROUSLY drizzle Worcestershire all over the shrimp, about 1/4 to 1/2 a cup. Drizzle Tabasco sauce over the top to your desired temperature. Some like it hot. Now grab your stick of butter and cut it into pats. Place the pats of butter on top of the shrimp as evenly spaced as possible. Place the pan of shrimp under the broiler in your oven for just about 10 minutes until the shrimp are no longer translucent. Serve with a roll of crusty French bread because you need something to absorb all of the glorious juices.",

Add the chicken thighs, and turn to coat. Marinate for 1 to 4 hours in the refrigerator. Heat a grill to high or a grill pan over high heat. Remove the thighs from the marinade and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Grill until just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes on each side, brushing with some of the peanutred chile sauce during the last few minutes of grilling. Remove from the grill, let rest for 5 minutes, and then shred into bite-size pieces. Heat the chicken stock and 1/2 cup of the peanutred chile sauce in a saute pan over medium heat. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Keep warm. To make the tacos, heat 2 inches of oil in a large deep pot to 350F. Combine the masa mix, salt, and 1 1/4 cups warm water in a large bowl, and mix until a smooth dough forms; add more water, a tablespoon at a time, if needed. Pull off pieces of dough and roll them into balls about the size of a Ping-Pong ball. Keep them covered with a piece of plastic wrap or a clean dish towel so they dont dry out. Cut a plastic food storage bag open down both sides, leaving the bottom attached, to form a rectangle. Lay one side of the plastic over the bottom of a tortilla press. Place a ball of dough in the center, and fold the other side of the plastic over the dough. Shut the top of the tortilla press and press firmly down on the dough to shape the tortilla. Drop the tortilla into the hot oil. When the tortilla floats to the surface, use a metal spatula to repeatedly douse the top with hot oil until it begins to puff up. (If the tortilla does not begin to puff, gently pat it with the spatula.) Flip it over, and using another spatula to support the side, press the first spatula into the center of the tortilla to form a taco shape. This process takes approximately 60 seconds. Transfer the taco to paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining dough balls. Fill each taco with some of the chicken, drizzle with a few tablespoons of the peanutred chile sauce, and top with the slaw. Heat the oil in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and ginger, and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and 1 cup water, bring to a boil, and simmer for 10 minutes . Add the ketchup, vinegar, Worcestershire, mustard, brown sugar, honey, molasses, chile powders, and chipotle. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened to about 1 1/2 cups, 30 to 40 minutes. Puree the mixture in a food processor until smooth; season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a clean saucepan and add the chicken stock and soy sauce. Boil over high heat until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the peanut butter and cook for 1 minute. Pour into a bowl and cool to room temperature. Combine the cabbage and onion in a large bowl. Whisk the vinegar, orange juice, oil, and honey together in a small bowl, and pour over the cabbage. Add the cilantro and mint, and season with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving.",

    "2 pieces (6 To 8 Oz. Size) Portioned Salmon Or 1 Salmon Fillet (Boneless/Skinless)\n3 Tablespoons Fish And Seafood Seasoning (Spade L Ranch Is Best)\n1 Tablespoon Sesame Seed Oil\nSeason one side of the salmon with the fish and seafood seasoning. Now drizzle the sesame seed oil into a frying pan. This oil has loads and loads of flavor so go easy. If you think you need more while the fish is cooking, I would probably use some olive oil. Heat the pan on a medium high heat. Let it get good and hot before you place the fillets in it. For beauty purposes, set the salmon in with the seasoned side up. Depending on the thickness of your fish, you should let these cook for about four minutes on one side before turning. You can check the ends to see how its cooking. As it cooks the meat will become a light/pale pink. Wait to turn it until it is just more than halfway up. To make sure it is thoroughly cooked, check the ends once again. It should be that pretty pink color throughout. Also, it should flake when a fork is inserted into it and pulled back a bit with the grain of the meat. You do not want to overcook fish; stay close!

    "12 lbs ham (we use one semi-boneless, fully cooked half ham)\n12 cup whole cloves\n12 cup brown sugar, packed\n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\n1 (20 ounce) can pineapple rings, drained, reserving liquid (packed in heavy syrup or pineapple juice, not water)\n1 (4 ounce) jar maraschino cherries, drained, reserving liquid\n12 ounces carbonated lemon-lime beverage (Sprite)\nPreheat oven to 325F. Remove wrapping and any plastic bone plug from ham. Place ham in roasting pan. I like one with high sides or a roasting pan with cover. Cut diagonal pattern into top of ham and place one clove clove in the center of each diamond. Prepare Glaze: Put liquids from pineapple and cherries in small saucepan with brown sugar, Worcheshire sauce and carbonated soda. Warm slightly on stovetop until brown sugar is dissolved. No need to boil! At this point, I usually use a food injector to inject some of the prepared glaze direct into several areas of the ham. Pour glaze over all surfaces of the ham. Place pineapple rings over as many surfaces of the ham as you can. Use toothpicks if necessary to \"pin\" rings to end or sides. Place maraschino cherry into the center of each pineapple ring, using toothpicks to anchor them. Though the original recipe did not state to, I like to cover the ham with foil (or roasting pan cover) to keep the ham really moist. Bake ham for 4-5 hours or until internal temperature reaches 160F (or 15-20 minutes per pound if you have a larger or small ham), basting every 30 minutes with pan drippings. Remove ham from oven and let set for 15-30 minutes before carving. Remove toothpicks before serving. Serve carved ham with pineapples and cherries. Note: Pan dripping are excellent for making baked beans.",

This makes 2 servings as a main dish, or 4 servings if it's a side dish. Fill a pot with water, add the chicken stock, and bring to a boil. Prepare your katakuriko slurry in the meantime. In another separate bowl, prepare the beaten egg. Put in the gyoza and simmer until the skins start to turn translucent and they are cooked through. The photo shows 1 serving. I added Japanese leeks, since I happened to have some. The skins have turned translucent. Now, add the katakuriko slurry, swirling the soup around with chopsticks from the center to the edges. Keep simmering. Continue swirling and add the beaten egg a few drops at a time. Swirl gently in a circle. Turn off the heat as soon as the egg floats to the top. It'll get hard if you don't. Add the soy sauce and sesame oil, and it's done. Put in some chopped leek, if you have some. Thicken the soup, even if it's a bother. The egg will be less likely to sink, and the soup will stay hot.

    "1 cup water\n1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter\n1 teaspoon sugar\n1 teaspoon salt\n2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves\n1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves\n1 cup plus 2 tablespoons bread flour\n4 large eggs\n4 ounces blue cheese, at room temperature\n2 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature\n1/2 cup heavy cream, lightly whipped to soft peaks\n2/3 cup honey, divided\nPort Wine Syrup, recipe follows\n1 1/2 tablespoons toasted, finely chopped walnuts\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside. In a heavy bottomed 1-quart saucepan, combine the water, butter, sugar, salt, thyme and rosemary. Bring to a rolling boil. Remove from the heat and add all of the flour, at once, to the pan and quickly stir vigorously to incorporate the flour into the liquid. Return the pan to the stove, and over a medium-low heat, continue to cook and stir the dough over the fire. Do this until the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan and forms a ball. Remove the dough from the saucepan, and place in an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix the dough on low speed until the dough is cooled down to about 140 degrees F, which is still quite warm to the touch, but cool enough to prevent the eggs from cooking if added to the dough. Raise the speed of the mixer to medium, and add 1 of the eggs to the dough and mix until completely incorporated. Continue adding the remaining eggs, 1 at a time, waiting until each egg is incorporated before adding the next egg. Immediately transfer the dough to a piping bag with a round tip. To form the herbed puffs, pipe out round mounds of the dough onto the prepared baking sheet that are about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Place the sheet pan in the oven and bake the choux dough for 12 minutes, or until golden brown. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F, and continue to bake until the puffs are dried out, about 22 minutes longer. Turn the oven off and remove the choux from the oven. Using the tip of a paring knife, cut a small slit in the side of each puff, near the bottom. Place the puffs back on the baking sheet and place back in the oven, propping the oven door open so the choux can dry out as they cool, about 1 hour or until oven is cool. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the blue cheese, cream cheese and whipped cream. Use a hand held electric mixer to combine the ingredients on a low speed, until well incorporated. Place the cheese filling in a piping bag with a star tip. Using a paring knife, make a small hole in the bottom of each puff. Use the pastry bag filled with the cheese mixture to pipe into the hole and fill the puffs. Place 1/3 cup of the honey in a small, shallow bowl or dish. Dip the bottom of each cheese filled puff into the honey and arrange the cheese puffs in a pyramid on a large plate. (The honey is used to anchor the puffs and to keep them from sliding.) Using the tines of a fork, drizzle the remaining 1/3 cup honey over the entire pyramid. Drizzle with the Port Wine Syrup and sprinkle the chopped walnuts over top. Serve the Croquembouche within the hour. 2 cups ruby Port wine 1 cup sugar Combine Port and sugar in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook over medium-high heat until reduced to a syrup.",
    "4 cups all-purpose flour\n2 tablespoons baking powder\n3 tablespoons sugar\n1 14 teaspoons cream of tartar\n12 teaspoon salt\n12 cup shortening\n12 cup butter (cold)\n1 13 cups milk\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees F. Sift together all dry ingredients in a medium size bowl. Stir ingredients to ensure ingredients are evenly dispearsed. Cut in shortening and butter until mixture looks like small peas or crumbs. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add all milk at once in the well. Stir just until dough starts to stick together. (The key to fluffy biscuits is little handeling). Transfer dough onto a floured board. Sprinkle dough and hands with flour to prevent sticking. Kneed dough gently 8 - 10 strokes; add flour little by little as needed to keep from sticking. Shape dough into a large rectangle about 1/2 inch thick using your hands. Cut using a large knife into squares; don't slide knife through, gently lift up.

Mix the water and 1 tablespoon of oil in a liquid measuring cup. Using a stand mixer with the dough hook mix flour, yeast, sugar, and salt on low speed. With the mixer running, slowly add water mixture and mix until dough comes together, about 1 minute. Increase speed to setting 2 or 3 and knead until dough is smooth and comes away from sides of bowl, about 8 minutes. Transfer dough to greased baking sheet and turn to coat. Stretch the dough to a large rectangle. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Stretch dough to corners of pan, cover loosely with plastic, and let rise in warm place until slightly puffed, about 45 minutes. Position oven rack to lowest setting and preheat oven to 500 degrees F. If you have a pizza stone place it on the rack. TOPPING While the dough is rising, drain the tomatoes in a colander over the sink. Combine the tomatoes, oil, garlic, oregano, and salt in bowl. Mix the mozzarella and Parmesan in second bowl. Sprinkle the cheeses over dough, leaving a half inch border around edges. Top with tomato mixture and bake until well browned and bubbling, about 15 minutes. Slide pizza onto wire rack, sprinkle with basil, and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.",

To form parchment paper packets: fold the parchment paper in half and cut out two heart shaped peices of parchment paper, using the fold as the center line as you would if making a valentine out of construction paper. Make sure you're hearts are each big enough to fit one of the filets easily within one half of the heart. Unfold hearts, place on baking sheet. Rub your filets in the olive oil to coat, then season with salt and pepper and a few squirts of lemon juice, if desired. Place each filet on one half of a heart, skin side down. Spread the top of each filet with the chevre, using as much as you like. You may not need the entire 3.5 ounces. Close the packets by folding over the other side of the heart, then rolling up and pressing the edges of the paper together starting at the top of the heart. Finish by twisting the pointed end to hold the packet together. Bake for about 20 minutes or until desired doneness is reached. I like to cut open the parchment paper during the last five minutes of cook time to make the cheese topping turn out a little brown and bubbly.",

Return the pork to the pot, and stir in the green chiles, diced tomatoes with juice, tomatillo salsa, and chicken broth. Season with oregano and clove. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, remove 2 cups of the soup (ensure there are no pork cubes in it), and pour into a blender. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree until smooth, then pour back into the cooking pot. This will create a thicker texture for your chili and will eliminate some of the chunky bits of chiles. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally until the pork is very tender, at least 35 minutes more.",

Add 4 tablespoons butter, and when it foams, add the sliced onion, leeks, carrot, and celery. Stir to coat with the butter, and season with 1 tablespoon salt and some pepper. Cook 5 minutes and add the chile, thyme, and parsley sprigs. Cook over medium heat about 5 minutes, until the vegetables are just starting to caramelize. Add 10 cups of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Turn the heat down and simmer 30 minutes. Strain the stock, discard the vegetables, and set the stock aside. Return the pot to medium heat for 2 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons butter, and when it foams, add the diced onions, cayenne, 1 teaspoon salt, and a healthy grind of pepper. Cook the onions about 5 minutes, stirring often, until theyre translucent and tender. Add the vegetable stock, turn the heat up to high, and bring to a boil. You will need to puree the soup in batches. Place 2 1/2 cups of the watercress, 1 tablespoon chives, 1 tablespoon chopped parsley, and 1 1/2 teaspoons tarragon in the blender. Ladle 1 1/2 cups of the hot stock over the greens. Cover tightly, and carefully start the blender at the lowest possible speed. When the mixture is pureed, add another cup of stock and turn the blender up to high. Add more stock, until the soup is a little thicker than heavy cream. Run the blender at high for 1 minute to ensure the soup is very smooth and creamy. With the motor running, pour in 1/2 cup of cream and taste for seasoning. Add a little squeeze of lemon juice if you like. At this point, the soups consistency should be that of heavy cream. Set the first batch of soup aside, and repeat the process with the remaining watercress, herbs, stock, and cream. Pour the hot soup into a large tureen or soup bowl and pass the toasts on the side, so they remain crunchy. Tell your guests to float the toasts in their soup. Preheat the oven to 375F.

Combine the butter, anchovy, shallot, lemon juice, zest, cayenne pepper, parsley, and chives in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste. When the toasts have cooled, spread them with gentlemans relish.",
    "200 grams tapioca flour\n220 grams Red Cabbage Kimchi (page 38)\n20 grams kimchi pickling liquid\nRice bran oil or canola oil, for frying\nFine sea salt\nPuree the tapioca flour, kimchi, and pickling liquid in a food processor until a smooth dough is formed. Divide the dough in half and roll one portion into a thin cylinder about 3/4 inch (2 centimeters) in diameter. Place the cylinder on a sheet of plastic wrap and cover with another sheet. With a rolling pin, roll the cylinder into a flat, thin sheet approximately 1/8 inch (3 millimeters) thick. The dough should be nearly translucent. Repeat with the other cylinder. Prepare a steamer. We use a deep hotel pan filled with steaming water with a shallower perforated hotel pan inserted above the water line to make a long steamer. This way both sheets of dough fit lengthwise on top of each other. If you have a smaller steamer, youll need to cut the sheets into pieces that fit in your steamer and stack them or cook them in batches. Steam the dough sheets, still wrapped in plastic, for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180F (80C). Line a wire rack with parchment paper and set it over a large sheet pan. (This will allow for even airflow.) Unwrap the steamed dough and lay it on the parchment. Place the pan in the oven and bake for 60 minutes or until the dough has dried. Flip the dough sheets occasionally to allow for even drying. When the sheets are completely dry and brittle, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool to room temperature. Once the dough is completely cool to the touch, break or cut it into bite-size pieces. In a large pot set over high heat, add enough oil to fill the pot halfway and heat it to 400F (205C). Line a wire rack with paper towels. Fry the crisps in batches. They will puff quickly and triple in size. Remove the crisps from the hot oil with a slotted spoon and put on the rack to drain.

    "1 (2 1/2-pound; 1kg) whole octopus, rinsed well (including inside head cavity); see note\nFill a pot large enough to hold the octopus with the octopus and enough cold water to cover. Set over high heat. Bring water to a simmer, then lower heat to maintain simmer. Cook until octopus is tender enough that you can pierce the thick part of a tentacle with a paring knife with little resistance, about 1 hour; keep in mind that this time is a rough estimate, and the octopus may be done sooner or it may take longer, but it will get there. Let octopus cool in the cooking water. Drain, wrap in plastic or store in an airtight container, and refrigerate until chilled. (Chilling helps set the skin so it doesn't fall off later, so it's good to do even if you're planning to serve the octopus warm.) The octopus can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. When ready to serve, carve the octopus by cutting off the tentacles where they converge on the body. At this convergence point, you will also find the hard beak; remove it. Cut away and discard the octopus's eyes as well. You can eat all that remains of the the tentacles and head pouch. Cut tentacles and head into pieces and add to a seafood salad or ceviche.

Invert the dough into a buttered bowl and carefully remove the blade. Turn the dough over so that the top is buttered, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature until it has doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. To form the buns, scrape the dough onto a floured work surface and use a bench scraper or knife to cut it in half. Roll each piece of dough under the palms of your hands to an 8-inch cylinder. Cut each cylinder of dough into eight 1-inch pieces. Place one of the pieces of dough on a lightly floured work surface and press and roll it to a 3-inch disk. Place a heaping tablespoon of the filling in the center and draw the sides of the disk of dough up all around the filling to meet in the center, enclosing the filling. Firmly pinch the seam closed and invert the bun, seam side down, onto one of the prepared pans. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.

Wine note: With just a bit of heat from the ground red pepper and sweet-tart mango chutney, Grilled Chicken Salad matches perfectly with a glass of chilled Hogue Riesling 2007 ($9) from Washington. The tropical fruit and pear flavors nicely echo the chutney, while the wine's refreshing sweetness and fresh acidity add zip and textural contrast to the creamy consistency of chicken salad. -Jeffery Lindenmuth",

    " Jim Lahey's No Knead Pizza With Broccoli Rabe, Garlic, Ginger, And Thai Chilis Recipe\n \nA pizza dough recipe that does not require a mixer! This recipe comes from Jim Lahey, of Sullivan Street Bakery in New York City, and uses a very wet, no-knead dough made in a mixer then folded several times before a long, slow rise. The result is a delicate, airy, crisp crust. Use this as a base for any pizza you dream up! This recipe takes advance planning, as the dough needs to rise for at least 18 hours.\n\nIngredients \n1 cup all-purpose flour\n1 cup bread flour\n1/4 teaspoon instant yeast\n1 teaspoon sea salt\n2 cups cold water\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided\n\nFor the pizza:\n1 bunch broccoli rabe, washed, ends trimmed\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced\n1 teaspoon minced ginger\n2 Thai chilis, thinly sliced\n1/2 teaspoon sea salt\n1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n\nInstructions\n1. In a large bowl, whisk together both flours, yeast and salt. Add water and olive oil to the bowl. Using a wooden spoon, mix until you can no longer mix. Use your hands to fold the dough over on itself a few times, until the flour is absorbed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Every 30 minutes for the next 3 hours, \"fold\" the dough by removing the plastic wrap and pulling the edges of the dough up and towards the center, folding it over on itself 4 times. After 3 hours, replace the plastic wrap with a kitchen towel and let sit at room temperature for 18 hours.\n2.

Work with one piece at a time, keeping the others covered with the kitchen towel. On a lightly floured surface, knead the first piece of dough a few times, then use a rolling pin to roll it out into a thin round. Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking. Sprinkle semolina onto a pizza peel (or the back of a baking",

    "Ingredients:\n\n1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n\n1 cup ice water (not more than 5 gallons)\n\nDirections:\n\n1. First, prepare the batter by combining the flour, salt, and water in a medium bowl. Add enough ice water (about 2 to 3 times the amount of flour) to your ice bath to produce a slightly thicker batter. Be careful not to get too much ice water in the cup!\n\nThe resulting batter must be at room temperature when you form the balls of dough. If your ice-water bath can accommodate more batter without overflowing, form the batter first, using enough water to produce a smooth, slightly thick mixture while not overwhelming the ice bath.\n\n2. Let the mixture sit in the ice-baths for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the room temperature, and then do what I did and bake the muffins. (Note: If you have an ice-bath warmer, this method is probably much easier than preparing it on the stove with a microwave-oven combo.)\n\n3. The second, and perhaps more difficult step is to remove the batter from the ice bath. It must be removed with wet hands and gently, as the water from the ice bath will not be able to soften the batter and will prevent the dough from rising. The goal is to remove the dough in chunks, rather than allowing it to float by. If you let the batter float, the air will create a bubble structure and the mixture will have a tendency to collapse. Once removed, the batter can be stored in a mold lined with plastic wrap in your refrigerator for a few weeks.\n\nWhat about using a microwave?\n\nIn addition to allrecipes.com, my favorite cookie recipes can be found in \"Cooking With A Girl: A Cookbook for Dads, Women and Kids,\" edited by Ann and Nancy Eberlein, and \"Sweet N' Savory: Recipes for Life's Better Days,\" edited by Suzanne Geller.\n\nIt's always fun to get my cookie fix in the form of the cookies on my blog and blogroll\n\nIf you're interested in trying Kittencal'S method for freezing corn on the cob, my friend and fellow creeper and casserole maker",
    "White chocolate buttercream was introduced to our kitchen more than 30 years ago by my mother, Mary. Her father used to cook homemade bread (or at least the dough-type stuff that comes out of his trusty mixing bowl, aka a mixer). The only thing his dad had was white sugar and an electric mixer. Over time it became quite popular among the older generation (as my mom would never have accepted it without her own grandmother's approval), so I learned it as soon as we could in college and haven't looked back since...my sister got me started in a similar way! Even now when I make ice cream, I always mix the powdered ice cream with milk or hot water instead of ice (to help preserve the yummy fats but less likely leave behind extra ice crystals after baking!).\n\nI use vanilla and dark choc (in the classic manner) mixed together, then spread both halves of each cookie on two large, clean tea towels rolled over them, using about 3/4 tsp vanilla in one towel plus a little more for spreading, 1 tbsp caramel sauce per 2 cups frosting, 3 cups heavy whipping Cream. Mix well until you reach the desired consistency. Spread these between wax paper and chill to set - but not too much; keep at room temperature if possible. This will keep in the fridge long enough to let the flavor develop. One day during my senior year there were three of the finest women and boys in school, including Mary's daughter (who happened to be the best girl in school!), asking their parents each and every week what they had made for dinner. They loved every bit of the batter, especially my friend Susan who commented, \"I love your stuff!\" When I asked Mary, she laughed:\n\n\"It's really good, but don't tell anyone.\"",

    "The first step in making this hot dog bun recipe is to make small cuts into each half of the dough. Cut these slits 1/2 inch apart as shown below. After you have cut this little opening, wrap and cover those edges with aluminum foil. Let sit at room temperature for an hour. Now preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C – so don't worry – it's safe!).\n\nPlace your two different loaves onto several baking sheets lined up along their shortest sides, then turn them over slightly until they're even. Take another piece of wire cooling rack or tin foil with three short sides and place the bottom third of the rolls on of these. Lay another sheet on top, and repeat with second and third loaves. Place the tops of all three loaf pans in an upside-down metal pan, if using.\n\nTo prepare your condiments, combine salt and vinegar together. Spread your mustard mixture liberally over all the buns then sprinkle it with paprika (no need to remove any crumbs). Bake for about 10 minutes or until the bread is browned slightly on the outside, but remains soft inside. Flip underbaked roll after 5 more minutes, then bake until the other side is done. Remove from oven when browning crust has faded some color. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or wrap in heavy foil to keep warm before eating!\n\nEnjoy this sweet rye hot dog bun recipe… as many as you can get my way 😉",

    "The roasting begins after 4pm and lasts 20 minutes; the vegetables are chopped, with half onion and carrots thrown in at the start of cooking (this gives you more colour); the parsnip leaves have to be halved lengthways then peeled before being added; the potatoes are brushed with 1/2 teaspoon of salt by 15 times, the whole process is repeated with 8 pieces at a time; the onions should be washed separately twice but this can already be done once in the potter's bowl prior to washing if one chooses: \"A good squeeze of lemon juice on them helps brighten up their appearance.\" Then turn them over and finish up by placing the greens under cool running water and bringing to a boil and throwing them down, adding enough stock to cover completely but not so much that no liquid reaches its surface; cook until tender, 20-25 minutes before serving; garnish with the dried oregano in place of the chopped parsley and serve immediately in your favorite pie crust or rice paper.

    "Ingredients 1 pound dry ground beef (turkey or pork), finely chopped 8-12 oz bacon 8 slices of thick cut Swiss cheese 2 stalks celery ½ cup red and green bell peppers 6 yellow mushrooms 3 cups chicken or beef broth 1 TBSP kosher salt & sugar 1 tsp dried sage, plus more to taste\n\n2 eggs 4 cups grated cheddar cheese\n\n5 cloves fresh garlic grated Instructions Combine ground beef and bacon in a large sauce pan over medium heat; season generously. Add sliced Swiss cheese. Cook until heated through, about 4 minutes. If too hot or not cooked just use a little bit less. Stir continuously after 3 minutes so meat juices separate. While Swiss Cheese melts keep vegetables covered under lid and season them well with salt, pepper & dried sage. When finished add chicken broth, cook until absorbed and liquid disappears then stir until dissolved. Remove Swiss Cheese and broccoli from sautee shell and set aside. To make filling prepare pot of butter and browning and cream gravy mixture then place onion rings into bottom of pot. Top with remaining ingredients and fry until golden brown. Transfer onion ring top to sauce pot with melted butter and mix through until blended. Place skillet over low heat. Pour egg mixture onto onion rings and cook until whites are set, about 7 minutes if done on stovetop. Stir egg coating lightly. Using tongs scoop out meat while adding the meat back in. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes at 400F until meat is heated through and tender when tested with fork or knife. Serve immediately with browned onions, Swiss cheese and bacon bits. Notes *This will be a huge bowl, I have it filled to almost max size!\n\nWe love that we can customize these! Be creative by chopping up your veggies into smaller bite sized pieces. Try adding some fried shallot at the end with the cheese! Or perhaps roast those sweet potatoes at a higher temp? That would surely make 'em happy and healthy 😉",

    "Healthy tender roast chicken in your pressure cooker Pressure-cooking tender, succulent bird that can be braised or baked, served right away! Author Mary Miller Recipe Type: Dinner Cuisine: American Serves 8 to 10 Prep Time 15 minutes Ingredients 2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts\n\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n\nSalt and pepper, depending on taste and size of pieces\n\nFor 1 whole bird (about 12 slices per breast) 3 tablespoons unsalted butter\n\n2 clove garlic, minced\n\n3 carrots, peeled & cut into bite-sized florets\n\n⅓ cup fresh sage stems\n\n¼ cup balsamic vinegar OR water To serve 4 medium potatoes chopped ½ pound mushrooms, sliced ¾ cup spinach leaves Instructions Heat oven to 400 degrees F, and grease a 6 - quart heavy-bottomed pot with the olive oil. Season the chicken thoroughly all over with salt and pepper. Rub it with the entire amount of the remaining dry herb mixture (or more if you're feeling really ambitious). Then pat the seasoning blend down onto the meat. Close the lid of the pressure cooker and set this thing back in there until ready to cook. Preheat the broiler. Remove the fat cap from the sides of the pot using a spoon. Put two cloves of garlic on top of the bone and place them inside the bone cavity as close together as possible. Roast the chicken for 20 minutes, checking occasionally throughout. After you have finished roasting the meat remove it completely from the pot using its handle. Add it to a food processor along with the rest of the herbs; pulse until smooth [See Note at beginning]. Pour both liquids through an accurate mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth then season to taste with salt and pepper. Rinse out this container of flavor and return it into the pressure cooker. Stir well, seal one last time, then bring the pressure up very slowly to 11 pounds of pressure in 5 minutes. Once the pressure has risen to this level, pour the liquid up through the mesh like you are dumping it into a bucket of icy cold water—not fast enough, as you will have excess liquid pouring out the valve. There will be quite some liquid. If desired add additional vegetables by adding them here after the liquid is poured over the chicken meat. Place the cover",

Then, add 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 tsp salt and 1 tablespoon sugar. Stir the flour mixture until you see no more lumps. Sprinkle 1/4 cup flour into the bottom of the bread pan and press into the dough.

Add enough flour each time as you mix until dough pulls away cleanly from sides then put on floured surface and knead, adding small amounts of additional flour. Kneading by hand took just about ten minutes but with Kitchen Aid mixer you can probably stop about half way through because this turns out very good even though not fully developed gluten – a nice chewy texture.

In addition to the chile pepper extract, you will need either an orange, grapefruit or tangerine; any fresh herb--or none of them if you don't feel like it; a large pinch of ground cumin powder and some brown sugar. You also might want cinnamon bark, cloves, nutmeg, vanilla beans or bay leaves available. To garnish: sesame seeds are nice but black sesame seeds are definitely best!! Then you'll add water until all ingredients have been stir well together (it took me about five minutes) into your bowl with marinated vegetables plus three cups vinegar per quart; set aside overnight while waiting on top shelf for everything else needed - salt lightly so nothing dries out during prepping time tomorrow morning when you start boiling those vegies down again right now...\n\nServings: 100\nCuisine Type : Asian Fusion\nWeight watchers points/calories per serving= 47",

Mix this with 2 medium sized egg yolks plus extra half an egg in case it is not enough! Or mix nuts as they are without adding any additional liquid).\n>     - About same quantity of flour to make a smooth dough which holds together well when squeezed between fingers but shouldn't be sticky either way add little drops at first rather than flood whole amount into mixture otherwise too much can ruin texture/consistency especially since there isn't liquid added like milk...or if necessary just sprinkle water over crumbs then knead until comes together again works really fast so easy even for me without fail now after years doing it lots times :) After making ball(s) wrap with clean plastic film & refrigerate overnight preferably before rolling out carefully try not pressing down excessively because later putting back will cause flattening more importantly no need excessive strength just gentle hand movements always give best results no matter how hard anything seems.. When taking round discs slice off outer edge gently brush away surplus butter or oil very lightly from surface just let natural flavours come through bake til golden brown & serve immediately while warm still nice cold bit better next day although keep covered tightly sealed away from damp air. Eat with hot tea coffee or wine whatever suits each individual taste!!

My all time favorite is a salsa verde — salsa de tomatillo — from an old cookbook. The key to this recipe is to only include the very best tasting tomatillos. If you've ever made salsa before and it was a bad batch — the culprit was probably that not-so-delicious can of Rotel, or a few mediocre tomatoes. I've found out that tomatillos should be tasted even before taking the husk off.\n\nSo here is a quick guide on how to pick good tomatillos:\n\n1. Peel off a few of the tomatillos and see if the sticky film has washed off, if it hasn't, then they're probably under-ripe.\n\n2. See if the tomatillos are of a darker green color\n\n3. Squeeze. Like tomatoes, if they give slightly and aren't too firm, then they're ripe enough.\n\nAside from tasting and looking good, tomatillos are great because of their versatility. I had a good friend who was once afraid or intimidated by this",

    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 13x9-inch pan with cooking spray.\n1. Set out the filling: In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar and ground cinnamon. Set aside.\n2. For the phyllo dough: In a 9x13-inch pan, lay one sheet of phyllo dough so that the edges hang over the sides of the pan. Brush the phyllo dough with some of the melted butter. Lay another phyllo dough sheet in the pan the same way.\n3. Repeat the layering and brushing process. (Use about 6 phyllo sheets, brushing each sheet with butter.) Pour the filling over the phyllo dough. Fold the phyllo over the filling to seal. (The baklava will be in 4 long rows; 2 filled rows on the top and bottom, and 2 blank rows on each side.)\n4. Next, cut through the phyllo with a sharp knife so that the baklava is in separate squares. This is very important. If you don't cut through the phyllo, when you remove the baklava from the pan, it will crumble into pieces since the filling expands in the oven and will break the phyllo dough.\n5. Top the baklava with remaining 4 sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each sheet with the melted butter. Fold up the edges of the phyllo sheets so they are flush with the top of the pan and brush with more butter. Place the baklava in the preheated oven and bake for about 40 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow to cool; then dust with the cinnamon and sugar mixture and cut into squares to serve.\nN.B.

Continue simmering another 20 minutes before removing lid completely while keeping warm over low flames (around 200 degrees F). Remove head last since its flesh can't be eaten raw like other parts but rather needs longer cooking process because more time means better taste accordingto experts who recommend waiting 5 hours minimum?

A recipe with multiple ingredients, in this case coffee, hot water, salt, a third teaspoon of hot water, sugar, and milk, is formatted in what would look like a table, but with only three columns, in this case, ingredients, quantities, and notes. A recipe may be quite complex, and it is a good idea to use multiple table elements, each identifying the recipe, the cooking process, and the individual ingredients. In the above example, it would seem appropriate to have a table element for the recipe itself, another for the instructions, and a third for the ingredients._ Figure 7-6 shows an example of a recipe element.\n\n _Cooking process. A recipe element with several ingredients requires a \"cooking process\" so the ingredients can be mixed and prepared properly._ Figure 7-7 shows an example of a cooking process element.\n\n _Ingredient properties. When each ingredient has its own property, it will be easier for users to understand the quantities needed for each component of a recipe._ Figure 7-8 shows an example of an ingredient. The recipe calls for a cup, plus a half-inch, of milk. The half-inch isn't part of the cup, but rather is its own value. So the cup is an amount and the half-inch is an increment with its own property.

(Melted butter or margarine can be substituted.) Add the sugar or honey, oil, salt and yeast. Mix well.\n\n•Stir in 3 cups flour until a dough is formed. Beat at med-high speed for 7 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl frequently. Add additional flour as necessary until the dough isn't too sticky to be kneaded. This dough will be more batter-like than most bread dough recipes.\n\n•With your fingers, crumble enough flour onto the dough to create a kneading surface. Press or pat the dough as flat as possible, then knead 6 to 8 times. Don't use too much of the reserved flour.\n\n•Cut the dough into 3 parts (like slicing a pie) and shape into loaves. Place loaves in the greased pans and press the remaining butter into the top of each loaf\n\n.

In addition, the method here is straightforward and the ingredients are certainly easy to come by—just go to the food store and find onions, eggs and some basic baking ingredients.\n\nOf course, this recipe is in many ways easier to follow than the onion bread recipe in the 1665 _Book of Household Management_ and the onion-bread recipe from the _New England Primer_ (both from Chapter 1).\n\nThe complexity of this recipe doesn't stop there.

Remove from cast-iron skillet and set aside.\n\nReduce heat to medium and sauté onion and garlic until the onion is translucent. Combine allspice, cinnamon, cumin, cayenne pepper, white pepper and coriander in a medium bowl. Add sautéed onion and garlic to this mixture also.\n\nIn a small bowl mix together honey, mustard, ketchup, soy sauce and water. Pour mixture into cast-iron skillet and bring to a simmer.\n\nReturn meat to skillet and baste with juice. Bake for 20 minutes until cooked through and baste every 20 minute intervals. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before cutting.\n\nNow that you have a more specific understanding of what you're looking for and what you're trying to avoid, read each ingredient that the recipe calls for and determine if it is safe or unsafe for you to ingest. As you identify ingredients that could potentially harm your health, you must look beyond recipes for new ideas, as well.\n\nIt's highly unlikely that you'll find an ingredient in a recipe that is absolutely safe or unhealthy. However, most ingredients can be classified as borderline (safe/unsafe) for many people. Ingredients like onion, tomato, garlic, etc., are typically safe for most people and should be considered borderline. There are also ingredients that are completely safe or completely unsafe for most people, including salt, sugar, milk, cheese, and so on.\n\nBy combining foods that are borderline for most people with foods that are completely safe and then taking steps to eliminate or substitute ingredients that could harm your health with something similar that is safe, you would have a recipe that would be safe for most people. Most recipes have several ingredients that are borderline or safe for you and others that are not. Use this as a first step in determining if a meal that you are about to eat is safe or not.\n\nWhen you begin to look at food in a more thoughtful way, you start to see that foods and ingredients are inherently good, bad, or neutral. Foods that are inherently bad like white sugar, for example, need",

Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add celery; cook and stir until tender. Add mushrooms and duck stock; bring to a boil. Place 18 to 24 wonton wrappers in the water. Meanwhile, combine egg yolk and white.\n\n2. Boil wontons 15 minutes, or until cooked. Drain, dry and cut into strips. Add wonton strips to boiling stock mixture and reduce heat to low.\n\n3. Brush edges of wontons with egg mixture. Working quickly, turn over wonton strip so the bottom side is on top. Remove from heat. Sprinkle with pepper. Refrigerate until completely cooled. Serve topped with egg strips as a garnish.\n\nThe above description of the recipe is actually a fairly simple and straightforward way of describing it. The recipe can be understood by somebody who has never made or tasted the dish. One of the main features of the recipe is the way it describes the process of making the dumplings. It describes the steps and the order in which the steps are performed. While many people reading a recipe will automatically assume that the steps should be performed in the order described, they may not always be. For example, they might not want the celery to be cooked until the end so that they avoid the possibility of it burning, or they might want to precook the mushrooms as part of a different dish.\n\nAnother feature of the above description is that it assumes that the recipe's reader is familiar with the ingredients and that the instructions are understandable. The following recipe description, although fairly simple and straightforward, assumes knowledge of some technical terms that might require more explanation:\n\nIn a bowl, combine soy sauce, oyster sauce, black bean sauce, sesame oil, honey, ginger, garlic, water chestnuts, and carrots. Mix together until vegetables are coated and flavors have been absorbed.\n\nStir in pork mixture, mixing well to combine.
