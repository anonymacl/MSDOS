    "In this paper, we propose several novel deep learning methods for object\nsaliency detection based on the powerful convolutional neural networks. In our\napproach, we use a gradient descent method to iteratively modify an input image\nbased on the pixel-wise gradients to reduce a cost function measuring the\nclass-specific objectness of the image. The pixel-wise gradients can be\nefficiently computed using the back-propagation algorithm. The discrepancy\nbetween the modified image and the original one may be used as a saliency map\nfor the image. Moreover, we have further proposed several new training methods\nto learn saliency-specific convolutional nets for object saliency detection, in\norder to leverage the available pixel-wise segmentation information. Our\nmethods are extremely computationally efficient (processing 20-40 images per\nsecond in one GPU). In this work, we use the computed saliency maps for image\nsegmentation. Experimental results on two benchmark tasks, namely Microsoft\nCOCO and Pascal VOC 2012, have shown that our proposed methods can generate\nhigh-quality salience maps, clearly outperforming many existing methods. In\nparticular, our approaches excel in handling many difficult images, which\ncontain complex background, highly-variable salient objects, multiple objects,\nand/or very small salient objects.",
    "  We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a\ndiscrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs\nin some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show\nthat the position measurements per each step with probability $p \\sim\n1/n^\\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\\beta<1$. We\nalso give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers\nfrom the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum\nwalk) can be seen as the parameter $\\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-\nand continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we\nintroduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal\nparts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the\nfinal time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW\nis obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence\ntheorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.\nFinally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This\nweak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently\nlong-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random\nwalks.\n",
    "  Little is known about the global topology of the Fatou set $U(f)$ for\nholomorphic endomorphisms $f: \\mathbb{CP}^k \\to \\mathbb{CP}^k$, when $k >1$.\nClassical theory describes $U(f)$ as the complement in $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$ of the\nsupport of a dynamically-defined closed positive $(1,1)$ current. Given any\nclosed positive $(1,1)$ current $S$ on $ \\mathbb{CP}^k$, we give a definition\nof linking number between closed loops in $\\mathbb{CP}^k \\setminus \\supp S$ and\nthe current $S$. It has the property that if $lk(\\gamma,S) \\neq 0$, then\n$\\gamma$ represents a non-trivial homology element in $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^k\n\\setminus \\supp S)$.\n  As an application, we use these linking numbers to establish that many\nclasses of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ have Fatou components with\ninfinitely generated first homology. For example, we prove that the Fatou set\nhas infinitely generated first homology for any polynomial endomorphism of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ for which the restriction to the line at infinity is hyperbolic\nand has disconnected Julia set. In addition we show that a polynomial skew\nproduct of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ has Fatou set with infinitely generated first\nhomology if some vertical Julia set is disconnected. We then conclude with a\nsection of concrete examples and questions for further study.\n",
    "The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a\npowerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain\npartitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the\nevolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi\nregions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the\ngeodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi\ndiagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric\nquadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the\nintegration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving\ncontours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour\nshortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away\nfrom the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity\ndistributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image\nsegmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The\nnumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed\ndual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results.",
    "Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous\ndriving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view\n(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,\nmaking automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by\nfisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation\nmethod is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more\ncomprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed\ninto fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by\ncameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result\nshows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's\naccuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This\nseven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for\nfisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide\nspecific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At\nlast, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye\nimages and obtained satisfactory results.

    "The standard petrography test method for measuring air voids in concrete\n(ASTM C457) requires a meticulous and long examination of sample phase\ncomposition under a stereomicroscope. The high expertise and specialized\nequipment discourage this test for routine concrete quality control. Though the\ntask can be alleviated with the aid of color-based image segmentation,\nadditional surface color treatment is required. Recently, deep learning\nalgorithms using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved\nunprecedented segmentation performance on image testing benchmarks. In this\nstudy, we investigated the feasibility of using CNN to conduct concrete\nsegmentation without the use of color treatment. The CNN demonstrated a strong\npotential to process a wide range of concretes, including those not involved in\nmodel training. The experimental results showed that CNN outperforms the\ncolor-based segmentation by a considerable margin, and has comparable accuracy\nto human experts. Furthermore, the segmentation time is reduced to mere\nseconds.",
    "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently,\nmany deep networks derived from U-Net have been extensively used in various\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks\nsimilar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of\ndiscontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks,\nwe propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask\npredictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The\ncontour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation\npredictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel\narchitecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders\n(thus having a shape of $\\Psi$), one decoder to learns the segmentation mask\nprediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour\ndetection and distance map estimation. The learning of these auxiliary tasks\nhelps in capturing the shape and the boundary information. We also propose a\nnew joint loss function for the proposed architecture. The loss function\nconsists of a weighted combination of Negative Log likelihood and Mean Square\nError loss. We have used two publicly available datasets: 1) Origa dataset for\nthe task of optic cup and disc segmentation and 2) Endovis segment dataset for\nthe task of polyp segmentation to evaluate our model. We have conducted\nextensive experiments using our network to show our model gives better results\nin terms of segmentation, boundary and shape metrics.",
    "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in\nrecent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.\nDeploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating\nand communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise\nuncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued\npredictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future\ntest points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit\nfinite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate\nthe size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,\ndistribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it\nin five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems\nwhere some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label\nclassification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)\nclassification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)\nimage segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an\nobject of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss\nextensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and\ndistributionally robust learning.",
    "  We undertook a mutually complementary analytic and computational study of the\nfull-fledged spherical (3D) quantum rotor subject to combined orienting and\naligning interactions characterized, respectively, by dimensionless parameters\n$\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. By making use of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY\nQM), we found two sets of conditions under which the problem of a spherical\nquantum pendulum becomes analytically solvable. These conditions coincide with\nthe loci $\\zeta=\\frac{\\eta^2}{4k^2}$ of the intersections of the eigenenergy\nsurfaces spanned by the $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ parameters. The integer topological\nindex $k$ is independent of the eigenstate and thus of the projection quantum\nnumber $m$.

    "  We obtain the existence and the structure of the weak uniform (with respect\nto the initial time) global attractor and construct a trajectory attractor for\nthe 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with a fixed time-dependent force\nsatisfying a translation boundedness condition. Moreover, we show that if the\nforce is normal and every complete bounded solution is strongly continuous,\nthen the uniform global attractor is strong, strongly compact, and solutions\nconverge strongly toward the trajectory attractor. Our method is based on\ntaking a closure of the autonomous evolutionary system without uniqueness,\nwhose trajectories are solutions to the nonautonomous 3D NSE. The established\nframework is general and can also be applied to other nonautonomous dissipative\npartial differential equations for which the uniqueness of solutions might not\nhold.

    "  We present XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of two low-metallicity\ncometary blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies, Mrk 59 and Mrk 71.

The low-metallicity of Mrk 59 appears to be responsible for\nthe presence of the two ULXs. IXO 72 has varied little over the last 10 yr,\nwhile IXO 73 has demonstrated a variability factor of ~4 over the same period.\nThe second BCD, Mrk 71, contains two faint X-ray point sources and two faint\nextended sources. One point source is likely a background AGN, while the other\nappears to be coincident with a very luminous star and a compact H II region at\nthe \"head\" of the cometary structure. The two faint extended sources are also\nassociated with massive H II complexes. Although both BCDs have the same\nmetallicity, the three sources in Mrk 71 have X-ray luminosities ~1-2 orders of\nmagnitude fainter than those in Mrk 59.

    "Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine\nlearning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high\ndimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.\nwith multiple levels of representation and abstraction.

    "  We present the construction of a dense, quasicrystalline packing of regular\ntetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was\nachieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in\nthe Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a\nvariant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 \"plane classes\" (compared with the\n190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of\nthe planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small\nnumber of plane classes was achieved by a certain \"golden rotation\" of the\ntetrahedra.\n",
    "Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation\ntasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with\nhigh-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.\nThe fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which\nleads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for\nsegmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust\ntraining and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective\nsupervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we\nexplicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise\nestimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original\nlabels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust\nlearning method to accommodate more information as the complements to\npixel-level learning.

Two\nscenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and\nprediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT\nimages for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most\nimportant classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for\ncoarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard\ndeviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some\nunimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some\nclasses and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the\naccuracy even.

    "Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume\nthat a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.\nThis is true for many applications, but not all.

Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "This work examines the use of a fully convolutional net (FCN) to find an\nimage segment, given a pixel within this segment region.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map. This simple method addresses two major challenges of image\nsegmentation: 1) Segmentation of unknown categories that were not included in\nthe training set. 2) Segmentation of both individual object instances (things)\nand non-objects (stuff), such as sky and vegetation. Hence, if the pointer\npixel is located within a person in a group, the net will output a mask that\ncovers that individual person; if the pointer point is located within the sky\nregion, the net returns the region of the sky in the image.

    "  In this paper, we develop a loop group description of harmonic maps\n$\\mathcal{F}: M \\rightarrow G/K$ ``of finite uniton type\", from a Riemann\nsurface $M$ into inner symmetric spaces of compact or non-compact type.

To be more concrete, we prove that every harmonic map of\nfinite uniton type from any Riemann surface into any compact or non-compact\ninner symmetric space has a normalized potential taking values in some\nnilpotent Lie subalgebra, as well as a normalized frame with initial condition\nidentity.

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples\ninto clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in\nnumerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,\nimage segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the\nexisting clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is\nthe dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.\nnumber of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the\nliterature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation\nmetrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and\nmemory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we\napply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to\ndetect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with\ntheir sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a\nDL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of\ninitialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated\nclusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the\nincoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that\nthe proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization\nparameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.",

    "Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,\nand has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.\nPractically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%\naccuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel\nFalling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation\nalgorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall\nmodel). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a\nball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment\nbasins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment\nbasin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic.

    "Recent years have witnessed the great progress of deep neural networks on\nsemantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training\nhigh-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,\nwhich can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training\nsuch models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.\nRecent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have\ndeveloped training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which\naddresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled\nexamples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which\nrepresent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very\nsmall labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning\nframework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made\navailable at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to\ninclude surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals\n--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that\nincluding unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more\npowerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better\ngenerability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in\nthe task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.\nFurthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined\nwith different deep architectures.",

    "Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection.

Here, we propose a new\ntwo-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires\nshape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that\nprocesses information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this\narchitecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the\ntwo streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical\nstream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively\nremoving noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the\nrelevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow\narchitecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.\nOur experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that\nproduces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts\nperformance on thinner and smaller objects.

    "  The Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008), Chaos 19, 023117\n(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase\noscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not\ndepend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems\ncan be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding\nmanifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an\noscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific\nparameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that\nparameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given\ncertain conditions.

    "Many deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation involve a Fully\nConvolutional Neural Network (FCN) followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF)\nto carry out inference over an image.

We therefore suggest incorporating\ninto the inference algorithm additional higher-order potentials inspired by the\nway humans identify and localize parts. We incorporate two relations that were\nshown to be useful to human object identification - containment and attachment\n- into the energy term of the CRF and evaluate their performance on the Pascal\nVOC Parts dataset.

The model is trained jointly in a multi-task learning setting.\nIn this paper, we propose Mixed-Supervised Dual-Network (MSDN), a novel\narchitecture which consists of two separate networks for the detection and\nsegmentation tasks respectively, and a series of connection modules between the\nlayers of the two networks. These connection modules are used to transfer\nuseful information from the auxiliary detection task to help the segmentation\ntask.

    "  We introduce a high-level graphical framework for designing and analysing\nquantum error correcting codes, centred on what we term the coherent parity\ncheck (CPC).

We show how CSS codes form a subset of CPC codes and, more\ngenerally, how to compute stabilizers for a CPC code. As an explicit example of\nthis framework, we give a method for turning almost any pair of classical\n[n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code. Further, we give a simple\ntechnique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and\ndemonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally, we use the\ngraphical tools to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within\nCPC codes. As our framework gives a new tool for constructing small- to\nmedium-sized codes with relatively high code rates, it provides a new source\nfor codes that could be suitable for emerging devices, while its zx-calculus\nfoundations enable natural integration of error correction with graphical\ncompiler toolchains. It also provides a powerful framework for reasoning about\nall stabilizer quantum error correction codes of any size.\n",
    "Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional\nnetworks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling\nlayers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to\npredictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has\nattempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or\nMRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between\nobjects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these\nproblems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The\ndownside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than\ntraditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.\n  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk\nNetwork (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and\nspatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity.\nOur proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and\nsemantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk\nlayer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the\nnetwork. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix\nmultiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks\nand it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard\nback-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional\nparameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces\nan improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.",

So this can be understood as one\napplication of Floer theory and the theory of $\\infty$-categories in basic\ndifferential geometry. We also develop, based on this $\\infty$-categorical\nFukaya theory, some basic new integer valued invariants of smooth manifolds,\ncalled quantum obstruction. On the way we also construct what we call quantum\nMaslov classes, which are higher degree variants of the relative Seidel\nmorphism. This also leads to new applications in Hofer geometry of the space of\nLagrangian equators in $S^2$.\n",

    "Most progress in semantic segmentation reports on daytime images taken under\nfavorable illumination conditions. We instead address the problem of semantic\nsegmentation of nighttime images and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting\ndaytime models to nighttime without using nighttime annotations. Moreover, we\ndesign a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of\nsemantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum\nframework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night via\nlabeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively\ndarker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspondences for the\nreal images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel\nuncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic\nsegmentation, designed for adverse conditions and including image regions\nbeyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion;\n3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which comprises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920\nunlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts\nplus a set of 151 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created\nwith our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark to perform our novel\nevaluation. Experiments show that our guided curriculum adaptation\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real nighttime sets both\nfor standard metrics and our uncertainty-aware metric. Furthermore, our\nuncertainty-aware evaluation reveals that selective invalidation of predictions\ncan lead to better results on data with ambiguous content such as our nighttime\nbenchmark and profit safety-oriented applications which involve invalid inputs.",
    "  Granular materials do not flow homogeneously like fluids when submitted to\nexternal stress,but often form rigid regions that are separated by narrow shear\nbands where the material yields and flows. This shear localization impacts\ntheir apparent rheology, which makes it difficult to infer a constitutive\nbehaviour from conventional rheometric measurements. Moreover, they present a\ndilatant behaviour, which makes their study in classical fixedvolume geometries\ndifficult. These features led to perform extensive studies with inclined plane\nflows, which were of crucial importance for the development and the validation\nof the $\\mu(I)$ rheology. Our aim is to develop a method to characterize\ngranular materials with rheometrical tools. Using unusual rheometry\nmeasurements in an annular shear cell adapted from Boyer et al.

    "Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a\nnatural language expression.

To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective\nby decoupling it into a \"Locate-Then-Segment\" (LTS) scheme. Given a language\nexpression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding\ntarget image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object\nbased on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual\nfeatures to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model\ninteraction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with\nposition prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a\nlight-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly\neffective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the\nprevious state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+\nand +3.4% on RefCOCOg).

The method partitions a QLF image into segments of uniform texture and\nintensity called superpixels; every superpixel is statistically modeled as a\nrealization of a single 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) whose parameters\nare estimated; the superpixel is then assigned to one of three classes\n(background, biofilm, tooth substratum) based on the training set of data.

In this paper, a novel\napproach for clustering based image segmentation is proposed. Here, we give\nimportance on color space and choose lab for this task. The famous hard\nclustering algorithm K-means is used, but as its performance is dependent on\nchoosing a proper distance measure, so, we go for cosine distance measure. Then\nthe segmented image is filtered with sobel filter. The filtered image is\nanalyzed with marker watershed algorithm to have the final segmented result of\nour original image. The MSE and PSNR values are evaluated to observe the\nperformance.",
    "Class imbalance has emerged as one of the major challenges for medical image\nsegmentation. The model cascade (MC) strategy significantly alleviates the\nclass imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for\ncoarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this\nmethod leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation\namong the models. To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model,\ni.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better\nthan MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net\nintegrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists\nof shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific\nparameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively\noptimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design\nboth an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based\ntraining strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between\ntasks and design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can\nadaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the\ncategory-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing\nmethod is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most\nimpressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing\nset and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed approaches, we\nalso won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating\nteams. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/chenhong-zhou/OM-Net.",
    "Deep convolutional neural networks have driven substantial advancements in\nthe automatic understanding of images. Requiring a large collection of images\nand their associated annotations is one of the main bottlenecks limiting the\nadoption of deep networks. In the task of medical image segmentation, requiring\npixel-level semantic annotations performed by human experts exacerbate this\ndifficulty. This paper proposes a new framework to train a fully convolutional\nsegmentation network from a large set of cheap unreliable annotations and a\nsmall set of expert-level clean annotations. We propose a spatially adaptive\nreweighting approach to treat clean and noisy pixel-level annotations\ncommensurately in the loss function. We deploy a meta-learning approach to\nassign higher importance to pixels whose loss gradient direction is closer to\nthose of clean data. Our experiments on training the network using segmentation\nground truth corrupted with different levels of annotation noise show how\nspatial reweighting improves the robustness of deep networks to noisy\nannotations.",
    "Machine learning methods have achieved good performance and been widely\napplied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively\nand be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a\ngood machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good\nmodel training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the\nperformance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the\nmachine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each\nprocedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training\ndata ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information\nfor the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each\nmodel or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model\ncapture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can\nprovide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible\nlocal optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in\nmachine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the\ndiversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically\nsummarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and\ninference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In\naddition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the\nmachine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing\nimaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation,\nobject detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some\nchallenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some\ndirections in future work.",
    "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a image into different\nregions or groups based on some characteristics like color, texture, motion or\nshape etc. Active contours is a popular variational method for object\nsegmentation in images, in which the user initializes a contour which evolves\nin order to optimize an objective function designed such that the desired\nobject boundary is the optimal solution. Recently, imaging modalities that\nproduce Manifold valued images have come up, for example, DT-MRI images, vector\nfields. The traditional active contour model does not work on such images. In\nthis paper, we generalize the active contour model to work on Manifold valued\nimages. As expected, our algorithm detects regions with similar Manifold values\nin the image. Our algorithm also produces expected results on usual gray-scale\nimages, since these are nothing but trivial examples of Manifold valued images.\nAs another application of our general active contour model, we perform texture\nsegmentation on gray-scale images by first creating an appropriate Manifold\nvalued image. We demonstrate segmentation results for manifold valued images\nand texture images.",
    "Brain extraction is a fundamental step for most brain imaging studies. In\nthis paper, we investigate the problem of skull stripping and propose\ncomplementary segmentation networks (CompNets) to accurately extract the brain\nfrom T1-weighted MRI scans, for both normal and pathological brain images. The\nproposed networks are designed in the framework of encoder-decoder networks and\nhave two pathways to learn features from both the brain tissue and its\ncomplementary part located outside of the brain. The complementary pathway\nextracts the features in the non-brain region and leads to a robust solution to\nbrain extraction from MRIs with pathologies, which do not exist in our training\ndataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our networks by evaluating them on\nthe OASIS dataset, resulting in the state of the art performance under the\ntwo-fold cross-validation setting. Moreover, the robustness of our networks is\nverified by testing on images with introduced pathologies and by showing its\ninvariance to unseen brain pathologies. In addition, our complementary network\ndesign is general and can be extended to address other image segmentation\nproblems with better generalization.",
    "We introduce the concept of derivate-based component-trees for images with an\narbitrary number of channels. The approach is a natural extension of the\nclassical component-tree devoted to gray-scale images. The similar structure\nenables the translation of many gray-level image processing techniques based on\nthe component-tree to hyperspectral and color images. As an example\napplication, we present an image segmentation approach that extracts Maximally\nStable Homogeneous Regions (MSHR). The approach very similar to MSER but can be\napplied to images with an arbitrary number of channels. As opposed to MSER, our\napproach implicitly segments regions with are both lighter and darker than\ntheir background for gray-scale images and can be used in OCR applications\nwhere MSER will fail. We introduce a local flooding-based immersion for the\nderivate-based component-tree construction which is linear in the number of\npixels. In the experiments, we show that the runtime scales favorably with an\nincreasing number of channels and may improve algorithms which build on MSER.",
    "  A distributed adaptive algorithm is proposed to solve a node-specific\nparameter estimation problem where nodes are interested in estimating\nparameters of local interest, parameters of common interest to a subset of\nnodes and parameters of global interest to the whole network. To address the\ndifferent node-specific parameter estimation problems, this novel algorithm\nrelies on a diffusion-based implementation of different Least Mean Squares\n(LMS) algorithms, each associated with the estimation of a specific set of\nlocal, common or global parameters. Coupled with the estimation of the\ndifferent sets of parameters, the implementation of each LMS algorithm is only\nundertaken by the nodes of the network interested in a specific set of local,\ncommon or global parameters. The study of convergence in the mean sense reveals\nthat the proposed algorithm is asymptotically unbiased. Moreover, a\nspatial-temporal energy conservation relation is provided to evaluate the\nsteady-state performance at each node in the mean-square sense. Finally, the\ntheoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed technique are\nvalidated through computer simulations in the context of cooperative spectrum\nsensing in Cognitive Radio networks.\n",
    "  The $A_\\infty$ T-system, also called the octahedron recurrence, is a\ndynamical recurrence relation. It can be realized as mutation in a\ncoefficient-free cluster algebra (Kedem 2008, Di Francesco and Kedem 2009). We\ndefine T-systems with principal coefficients from cluster algebra aspect, and\ngive combinatorial solutions with respect to any valid initial condition in\nterms of partition functions of perfect matchings, non-intersecting paths and\nnetworks. This also provides a solution to other systems with various choices\nof coefficients on T-systems including Speyer's octahedron recurrence (Speyer\n2007), generalized lambda-determinants (Di Francesco 2013) and (higher)\npentagram maps (Schwartz 1992, Ovsienko et al. 2010, Glick 2011, Gekhtman et\nal. 2014).\n",
    "  We characterize Leavitt path algebras which are Rickart, Baer, and Baer\n$*$-rings in terms of the properties of the underlying graph. In order to treat\nnon-unital Leavitt path algebras as well, we generalize these\nannihilator-related properties to locally unital rings and provide a more\ngeneral characterizations of Leavitt path algebras which are locally Rickart,\nlocally Baer, and locally Baer $*$-rings. Leavitt path algebras are also graded\nrings and we formulate the graded versions of these annihilator-related\nproperties and characterize Leavitt path algebras having those properties as\nwell.\n  Our characterizations provide a quick way to generate a wide variety of\nexamples of rings. For example, creating a Baer and not a Baer $*$-ring, a\nRickart $*$-ring which is not Baer, or a Baer and not a Rickart $*$-ring, is\nstraightforward using the graph-theoretic properties from our results. In\naddition, our characterizations showcase more properties which distinguish\nbehavior of Leavitt path algebras from their $C^*$-algebra counterparts. For\nexample, while a graph $C^*$-algebra is Baer (and a Baer $*$-ring) if and only\nif the underlying graph is finite and acyclic, a Leavitt path algebra is Baer\nif and only if the graph is finite and no cycle has an exit, and it is a Baer\n$*$-ring if and only if the graph is a finite disjoint union of graphs which\nare finite and acyclic or loops.\n",
    "We present Convolutional Oriented Boundaries (COB), which produces multiscale\noriented contours and region hierarchies starting from generic image\nclassification Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). COB is computationally\nefficient, because it requires a single CNN forward pass for multi-scale\ncontour detection and it uses a novel sparse boundary representation for\nhierarchical segmentation; it gives a significant leap in performance over the\nstate-of-the-art, and it generalizes very well to unseen categories and\ndatasets. Particularly, we show that learning to estimate not only contour\nstrength but also orientation provides more accurate results. We perform\nextensive experiments for low-level applications on BSDS, PASCAL Context,\nPASCAL Segmentation, and NYUD to evaluate boundary detection performance,\nshowing that COB provides state-of-the-art contours and region hierarchies in\nall datasets. We also evaluate COB on high-level tasks when coupled with\nmultiple pipelines for object proposals, semantic contours, semantic\nsegmentation, and object detection on MS-COCO, SBD, and PASCAL; showing that\nCOB also improves the results for all tasks.",
    "Semi-supervised learning has recently been attracting attention as an\nalternative to fully supervised models that require large pools of labeled\ndata.

    "While making a tremendous impact in various fields, deep neural networks\nusually require large amounts of labeled data for training which are expensive\nto collect in many applications, especially in the medical domain. Unlabeled\ndata, on the other hand, is much more abundant. Semi-supervised learning\ntechniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage\nunlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware\nmulti-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data,\nsuch as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is\nachieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate\ndifferent views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical\n3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In\naddition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate\nthe reliability of each view's prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one\nview requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our\nself-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each\nunlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach\ncan take advantage of unlabeled data during training. We show the effectiveness\nof our proposed semi-supervised method on several public datasets from medical\nimage segmentation tasks (NIH pancreas & LiTS liver tumor dataset). Meanwhile,\na fully-supervised method based on our approach achieved state-of-the-art\nperformances on both the LiTS liver tumor segmentation and the Medical\nSegmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, demonstrating the robustness and value\nof our framework, even when fully supervised training is feasible.",
    "We introduce a novel Deep Learning framework, which quantitatively estimates\nimage segmentation quality without the need for human inspection or labeling.\nWe refer to this method as a Quality Assurance Network -- QANet. Specifically,\ngiven an image and a `proposed' corresponding segmentation, obtained by any\nmethod including manual annotation, the QANet solves a regression problem in\norder to estimate a predefined quality measure with respect to the unknown\nground truth. The QANet is by no means yet another segmentation method.\nInstead, it performs a multi-level, multi-feature comparison of an\nimage-segmentation pair based on a unique network architecture, called the\nRibCage.\n  To demonstrate the strength of the QANet, we addressed the evaluation of\ninstance segmentation using two different datasets from different domains,\nnamely, high throughput live cell microscopy images from the Cell Segmentation\nBenchmark and natural images of plants from the Leaf Segmentation Challenge.\nWhile synthesized segmentations were used to train the QANet, it was tested on\nsegmentations obtained by publicly available methods that participated in the\ndifferent challenges. We show that the QANet accurately estimates the scores of\nthe evaluated segmentations with respect to the hidden ground truth, as\npublished by the challenges' organizers.\n  The code is available at: TBD.",
    "Person re-identification is becoming a hot research for developing both\nmachine learning algorithms and video surveillance applications. The task of\nperson re-identification is to determine which person in a gallery has the same\nidentity to a probe image. This task basically assumes that the subject of the\nprobe image belongs to the gallery, that is, the gallery contains this person.\nHowever, in practical applications such as searching a suspect in a video, this\nassumption is usually not true. In this paper, we consider the open-set person\nre-identification problem, which includes two sub-tasks, detection and\nidentification. The detection sub-task is to determine the presence of the\nprobe subject in the gallery, and the identification sub-task is to determine\nwhich person in the gallery has the same identity as the accepted probe. We\npresent a database collected from a video surveillance setting of 6 cameras,\nwith 200 persons and 7,413 images segmented. Based on this database, we develop\na benchmark protocol for evaluating the performance under the open-set person\nre-identification scenario. Several popular metric learning algorithms for\nperson re-identification have been evaluated as baselines. From the baseline\nperformance, we observe that the open-set person re-identification problem is\nstill largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed.",

    "All four Britons held by the US in Guantanamo Bay will be returned to the UK within weeks, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Commons on Tuesday.\nMoazzam Begg, from Birmingham, and Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar and Feroz Abbasi, from London, have been held by the US for almost three years. They were detained in the Cuban camp as part of the US-led \"war on terror\". Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after \"intensive and complex discussions\" over security. He said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003. All four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government, Mr Straw said.\nBut he added: \"Once they are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity.\" The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the return of the four detainees. But he said there were still \"serious questions\" both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said the four had been rescued from a \"legal no-man's land\". \"Their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process.\"\nAzmat Begg, father of Moazzam, thanked his lawyers and the British people for the support he had received while campaigning for his son's release. He added: \"If they have done something wrong, of course they should be punished, but if they haven't, they shouldn't have been there.\" Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. She said: \"They should at the outset have said quite clearly to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down. \"They didn't do that. They colluded with it.\" Moazzam Begg's Labour MP Roger Godsiff welcomed his release, but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges. Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said: \"People get released from prison when it's found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. \"I don't see any difference in this case.\" Human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba. Amnesty International has called Camp Delta a \"major human-rights scandal\" and an \"icon of lawlessness\". Both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as \"long overdue\". Civil rights group Liberty said it was \"delighted\" but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.\nDirector Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to \"practise what it preaches\" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars. The US has also announced that 48-year-old Australian Mamdouh Habib, previously accused of terrorist offences, will be released without charge from Camp Delta. Five British detainees released from Guantanamo in March last year were questioned by UK police before being released without charge.",
    "Technology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.\nThe firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.\nCurrently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy \"appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content\". The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.\nThe move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. \"In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past,\" said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. \"The difference is that it is very fragmented,\" he said. \"It's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race\" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsoft's \"Plays for Sure\" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.\nShelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apple's iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. \"Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods,\" she said.\nShe said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. \"It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,\" she said, \"and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.\" Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. \"People want portability,\" she said, \"and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.\" Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. \"Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,\" he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. \"The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on.\"",

    "Greek athletics' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou for missing doping tests.\nThe pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year's Athens Olympics. They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. \"A decision is now expected by around mid-March,\" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos. Kenteris, 31, who won the men's 200m title at the 2000 Sydney Games and Thanou, 30, who won the women's 100m silver medal in Sydney, face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry.

Jol added: \"We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. \"What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it.\n\"We didn't play particularly well but I am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three.\" Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. He said: \"My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. \"It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. \"It's really, really over.

It's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. \"It's not every game you score from the halfway line.\" Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. \"I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game,\" Ferguson told MUTV. \"What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays. \"But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.\n\"Thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. So you wouldn't be wasting a lot of time. \"I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football.\" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. \"When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence,\" said Wenger. \"It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.\"",

    "UK airport operator BAA has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.\nThe comments come a day ahead of a High Court challenge by residents' groups and local councils to the government's White Paper. The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. \"We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,\" a BAA spokesman said.\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. Among other measures, BAA has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near Stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.\nAt Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was \"fundamentally flawed\" and did not follow the proper consultation process. \"We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government White Paper,\" said Stop Stansted Expansion chairman Peter Sanders said. HACAN chairman John Stewart said: \"Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare. \"It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. \"Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. \" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February.",
    "Allan Scott is confident of winning a medal at next week's European Indoor Championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.\nThe 22-year-old Scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the Jose M Cagigal Memorial meeting in Madrid. \"It was definitely a learning curve and I certainly haven't ruled out challenging for a medal next week,\" said the East Kilbride athlete. The race was won by Felipe Vivancos, who equalled the Spanish record.\nSweden's Robert Kronberg was second, with Haiti's Dudley Dorival in third. Scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. He won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first IAAF Indoor Grand Prix circuit final. \"I should have done better than that,\" he said. \"I felt I could have won it.

    "AC Milan defender Jaap Stam says Manchester United \"know they made a mistake\" by selling him in 2001.\nThe sides meet at Old Trafford in the Champions League game on Wednesday and the 32-year-old's Dutchman's presence is sure to add spice to the fixture. \"United made a mistake in selling me,\" Stam told Uefa's Champions magazine. \"I was settled at Manchester United, but they wanted to sell me. If a club want to sell you, there is nothing you can do. You can be sold like cattle.\" Sir Alex Ferguson surprised the football world - and Stam - by selling the Dutchman to Lazio for £16.5m in August 2001. The decision came shortly after Stam claimed in his autobiography that Ferguson had tapped him up when he was at PSV Eindhoven. But Ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. The affair still rankles with the Dutchman.\n\"I was settled at Manchester United, I had even just ordered a new kitchen, but they wanted to sell me,\" he said. \"In what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes? \"Of course, you can refuse to go, but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. I don't agree that players control the game. \"There have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers, but I have turned them down. What's the point?\"\nWednesday's game at Old Trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between United's young attackers Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and Milan's veteran defence of Stam, Paolo Maldini, Cafu and Alessandro Costacurta. Stam says Rooney's teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game. \"We can't all be Wayne Rooneys - at his age I was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone,\" he said. \"Starting late can be a good thing. Some kids who start early get bored. \"I had my youth - having fun, drinking beers, blowing up milk cannisters. It sounds strange but it's a tradition where I grew up in Kampen - and I had done all the things I wanted to do.\"",
    "Dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, Media Labs Europe, is to shut down.\nThe research centre, which was started by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts. Since its opening in 2000, the centre has developed ideas, such as implants for teeth, and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. The centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. In a statement, Media Labs Europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the Irish Government nor the prestigious US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was willing to fund it. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies, in an attempt to regenerate the area.\nAbout three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the Labs' long-term survival. The Labs needed about 10 million euros (US$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. \"In the end, it was too deep and too long a recession,\" said Simon Jones, the Labs' managing director. Ian Pearson, BT's futurologist, told the BBC News website that the closure was a \"real shame\". BT was just one of the companies that had worked with the Labs, looking at RFID tag developments and video conferencing. \"There were a lot of very talented, creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society. \"I have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost.\"\nNoel Dempsey, the government's communications minister, said Mr Ahern had been \"very committed\" to the project. \"He is, I know, very disappointed it has come to this. At the time it seemed to be the right thing to do,\" he said. \"Unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate.\"\nDuring its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. In recent months, 14 patent applications had been filed by the Labs. Many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. Several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. The Human Connectedness group, for example, developed the iBand, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. This information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. Other projects looked at using other human senses, like touch, to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment, or on the body itself. One project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. The Labs, set up in an old Guinness brewery, housed around 100 people, made up of staff, researchers, students, collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. It is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the Labs close on 1 February. According to its latest accounts, Media Lab Europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about US$10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million euros (US$3.3 million).",

    "A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.\nThe drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug's benefits. But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.\nApproximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK. Many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.\nNow, GW Pharma's Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. \"We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,\" said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.\nThe UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex's launch in the UK. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p.",
    "The nuclear unit of Russian energy giant Gazprom is reportedly facing a 1bn rouble ($35.7m; £19.1m) back-tax claim for the 2001-2003 period.\nVedomosti newspaper reported that Russian authorities made the demand at the end of last year. The paper added that most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company's export activity. Gazprom, the biggest gas company in the world, took over nuclear fuel giant Atomstroieksport in October 2004. The main project of Atomstroieksport is the building of a nuclear plant in Iran, which has been a source of tension between Russia and the US.\nGazprom is one of the key players in the complex Russian energy market, where the government of Vladimir Putin has made moves to regain state influence over the sector. Gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm Rosneft, the company that eventually acquired Yuganskneftegas, the main unit of embattled oil giant Yukos. Claims for back-taxes was a tool used against Yukos, and led to the enforced sale Yuganskneftegas. Some analysts fear the Kremlin will continue to use these sort of moves to boost the efforts of the state to regain control over strategically important sectors such as oil.",
    "Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen.\nAlan Archibald prodded United ahead in 19 minutes and James Grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later. Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. Tony Bullock in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley. Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless.\nUnited restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. Jason Scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing Crawford and he coolly beat Ryan Esson from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. Grady received a pass from Crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of Esson. The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from Esson to keep out Robson's drive after 62 minutes. The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area.

    "The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.\nPrivate sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\nThe ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\n\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\nA slowdown in the housing market and this year's surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"",
    "UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered £960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.\nIn a speech, he called for action to reach the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. Mr Brown has just returned from a tour of African nations. The £1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health.\nThe chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK's Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday. Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra £0.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation. That could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. As well as pledging £960m over 15 years to the immunisation IFF, Britain urged other donors to contribute.\nIf Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued. Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. War on Want's John Hilary said: \"Compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. \"As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.\"",
    "Belgian brewing giant Inbev has seen its profits soar thanks to its acquisition of Brazil's biggest beer firm Ambev last year.\nInbev, which makes Stella Artois, said pre-tax profits for 2004 rose 56% to 1.16bn euros ($1.5bn; £800m), and said it expected solid growth in 2005. The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world's biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev's products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. \"It's the Brazil business that's doing it,\" said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev's strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil's beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev's European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.",

They also have a good record at the Stade de France, having won their first two games there, in 1999 and 2001. Wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed Italy 38-8 in Rome.\nKevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing.

    "You can now buy \"trusted computers\", but can we really trust the PC vendors, asks technology analyst Bill Thompson.\nIf you have recently bought an IBM ThinkVantage computer, a Dell Optiplex, or one of a whole range of laptops from Toshiba, HP/Compaq or Samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (TPM) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to children's toys. But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. And as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. A big advantage of the TPM is that it is hardware-based.\nAt the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. It might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor.\nHardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. This is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers. As a result we settle for second best. So when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward. After all, if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. And if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. Instead you have to use special software, like HP's ProtectTools or Wave Systems' Embassy. This provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks. Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows, \"Longhorn\". This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the \"Next Generation Secure Computing Base\", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. However there is a downside to the increased security from viruses, spyware and data theft that this will provide.\nBecause the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (DRM) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them. We have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. Users of Apple's iTunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other iTunes users, a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection.\nBut the latest version of iTunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a CD. Another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from Real's Harmony service on your iPod. Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. Similarly, users of TiVo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows, and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it. One wonders whether hardware-based DRM will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. It will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. Once it is unlocked then someone, somewhere, will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. And once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. The efforts going into DRM would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. The record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us, most of the time, will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. They will benefit more by building a market in which I can share songs with my friends, record shows I want to watch later, and burn CDs for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.",
    "Britain has offered to send a company of 120 Gurkhas to assist with the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia, Downing Street said.\nThe deployment would involve troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, based in Brunei. Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province. Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.\nHowever a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in Indonesia which the Gurkhas might be able to help with. The spokesman said: \"Following this morning's daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort, the government has formally offered the Indonesian government the assistance of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters. \"This is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean.\"\nIndonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami, with 94,000 of the 140,000 confirmed deaths so far. International Development Minister Gareth Thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of Aceh. \"We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment,\" he said. \"We've also had RAF aircraft flying in equipment which the UN desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in Aceh province as well.\" The offer comes as the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw arrives in Indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.",
    "The US economy has grown more than expected, expanding at an annual rate of 3.8% in the last quarter of 2004.\nThe gross domestic product figure was ahead of the 3.1% the government estimated a month ago. The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement. Growth was at an annual rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2004 and for the year it came in at 4.4%, the best figure in five years. However, the positive economic climate may lead to a rise in interest rates, with many expecting US rates to rise on 22 March. In the January-to-March quarter, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 4%, economists forecast.

    "Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\"",
    "Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was \"out of control\" during the \"wild\" 1960s.\nLucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as \"Precious\" at school. Despite being told he was a \"nutter who died at sea\" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound found out about it last year. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.\nMr Pound, who is now married with two other teenage children, said: \"I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead.\" He said his first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a \"set-up\" but he then realised all the dates fitted. \"It was a pretty horrible thing with a pretty happy ending. I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,\" said the Ealing North MP. \"I don't blame Lucy's mother. I was pretty much out of control. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.\"\nMr Pound says he rang Lucy as soon as he got her letter, they met up and have been in contact ever since. Describing that first meeting at London's King Cross station, he said: \"The earth went from under my feet ... We were walking across the Euston Road and I took her arm to take her across and there was an immediate connection. \"We were finishing each other sentences.\" Lucy, who was adopted by a family from Essex, wants to remain anonymous for the sake of her adoptive father and her children. Mr Pound said his wife Maggie had been fully supportive and their two children Emily, 16, and Pelham, 14 were pleased to have an older sister.",
    "Japan's box office received a 3.8% boost last year, with ticket sales worth 211bn yen (£1.08bn).\nThe surge was led by animated movie Howl's Moving Castle, which took 20bn yen (£102m) to become the biggest film in Japan in 2004. It is expected to match the 30.7bn yen (£157m) record of Hayao Miyazaki's previous film Spirited Away. Japan Motion Picture Producers figures showed that 170 million cinema admissions were made in Japan in 2004. The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, was the biggest foreign movie hit in Japan last year, taking 13.8bn yen (£70.7m).\nIt was followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Finding Nemo and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The second highest-grossing Japanese film was romantic drama Crying Out Love in the Centre of the World, followed by Be With You and Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation. Japanese films accounted for 37.5% of Japan's box office total last year, with foreign films taking the remaining 62.5%. This represented a 4.5% gain for the proportion of Japanese films in 2004 compared to 2003. The number of Japanese films released rose to 310 in 2004 from 287 the previous year. Sales of movies on DVD and video amounted to 497bn yen (£2.54bn) for the year.",
    "Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be \"the most accessible browser on the market\", according to its authors.\nThe latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"\nAnother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.\nThe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.",
    "Jamie Costin should be paralysed.\nHe says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts. Hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.\"",
    "Stan Lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit Spider-Man movies.\nMany marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stan Lieberman, got a job in Timely Publications, a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, now legally adopted.\nBy the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\nLee's answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee's life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York's skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\n\"Just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee's influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.\nIn 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. His latest project is a superhero based on a real person - Jay J Armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. But his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, The Hulk and Daredevil have all been turned into Hollywood action movies in the last five years. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. It seems Stan Lee is as indestructible as his heroes.",
    "One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.\nYoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\nThere was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan's most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\nMr Tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn't let me use the silk futon, saying it's a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan's troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank's bad loans.",

    "Ulster clung on for a morale-boosting Celtic League win over bottom club Borders at Netherdale on Friday night.\nA late try by Borders substitute Jonny Weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the Scottish side could not complete the fightback. Ulster had led 20-6 with tries from Paul Steinmetz and Bryn Cunningham. But the Irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. Calum MacRae surrendered possession before centre Steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. Substitute Joe Pattison - who had come on for the injured Gareth Morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.\nThe speedy Steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving Adam Larkin an easy conversion. Ally Warnock clawed back three points for Borders, but they were soon hit by another double-blow. First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward. Larkin again added the extras. Even worse was to come for Borders when Larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to Kelly Brown being sin-binned. The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end. And he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory. \"Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time,\" said McCall. \"In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.\"\nMorton, Moffat, MacRae, Hore, Berthinussen, Warnock, Moore, Thomson, Ford, Douglas, Blair, Stewart, Gray, Brown, McEntee.\nKay, Parr, McGee, Rennick, Weston, Millar, Pattison.\nCunningham, Maxwell, Bell, Steinmetz, Howe, Larkin, Campbell, S.

Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March. \"I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen,\" Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday. \"I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago.

    "Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\nTreasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare.\n- Increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60,000 \n - A freeze on petrol duty \n - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \n - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than £60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to £150,000 in February.\nThe Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn.\"\nBut Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\nFor the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a £2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.",
    "Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was \"one of the proudest nights of my career.\"\nThe Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: \"It was a really great night. \"The players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans. \"We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances. For Liverpool, this result is very, very important.\" Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. The Reds scored three second-half goals in a sensational comeback capped by Gerrard's 20-yard drive. He added: \"Steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game.\n\"I have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us. \"I felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters, I cannot thank them enough. \"I want to say thank-you to the supporters, they were magnificent to help us achieve this result.\" Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time. He said: \"I'd be lying if I thought we were going through when we were losing at half-time.\n\"We had a mountain to climb, but we have climbed it and credit to everyone. \"That was one of the best goals I have scored, I caught it sweet, I haven't caught one like that for ages.

    "Music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.\nThe debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser's dream come true and a branding nightmare. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing 'oxygen' for companies that support illegal downloading. \"You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,\" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.\nHe urged people to follow his lead and 'dump' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. 'Networks like eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses,\" it said. But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\nThe reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. \"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,\" he said. \"If you put the legality issues aside, not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience,\" he added. Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical. \"We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. It is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks,\" read a statement from the discount phone firm. It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.\nHowever Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said. \"I would be surprised if these brands didn't have the know-how to prevent this happening,\" he said. At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. \"Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity, including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - Senator John Kerry and President George W. Bush,\" said chief executive Sam Yagan. There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network, he thinks. \"Peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they're most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media,\" he said.",

But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.\n\"You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible,\" says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. \"It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.\" Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.\nMainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing \"export quality\" rap.\nThe web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its \"infant stage\". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. \"He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,\" Millan says. \"He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world.\" Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. \"Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,\" Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.\nBut one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. \"It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now,\" Millan says. \"And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing.\" Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.",
    "More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests.\nTheir biggest worries are not terror threats, but over-regulation, low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.\nGlobal business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandals in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. Across Europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called IFRS. Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.\nAlready, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a \"significant threat\" or \"one of the biggest threats\". But PwC's global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.\nAccording to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: \"One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won't kill your business anymore.\" Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. Mr DiPiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had \"adjusted\" to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.\n - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.",
    "Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, is to be released in 50 countries around the world, its distributor has said.\nHowl's Moving Castle set a Japanese box office record last week, taking 1.5bn yen (£7.7m) in its first two days. Miyazaki won an Oscar earlier this year for Spirited Away, Japan's first Academy Award for nearly 50 years. Howl's Moving Castle is based on a children's fantasy novel by UK author Diana Wynne Jones. It tells the story of an 18-year-old woman who ages dramatically after falling under a witch's spell. She heads to a moving castle kept by Howl, a wizard, and searches for a way to become normal again. A spokesman for distributor Toho said the film \"has received strong interest from domestic audiences and foreign media and viewers alike\". \"We have a good feeling about this film. We saw very good viewer response,\" he added. The film's worldwide release will start in South Korea on 24 December, and France on 12 January.",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\nSlower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\nAnd recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\nBusiness groups welcomed the MPC's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"",
    "Aston Villa's Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.\nThe striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. \"Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge,\" said Villa boss David O'Leary. \"I won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea.\" Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because O'Leary had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villa's manager's problems in that department.",
    "The US has pushed Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.\nIt is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, under the US Department of Energy. IBM test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The previous top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocked up 35.86. The Top 500 list was announced on Monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world.\nIt is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second.\nOnce completed in 2005, Blue Gene/L will be more powerful than its current prototype. \"Next year with the final Blue Gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat,\" said Erich Strohmaier, one of the co-founders of the Top500 list. It will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers.\nIn second place was Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at the US space agency's (Nasa) Ames Research Center in California. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second (teraflops) in October. It will be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The defeated Japanese contender, the Earth Simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity.\nSince the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.",
    "A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.\nThe draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. \"There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,\" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.\nIn December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.",
    "Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet \"rogue-dialling\" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.\nIt has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge. Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. They must warn people earlier about possible fraud, Icstis said.\nPeople who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. Victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: \"Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. \"If my bill goes over the usual £50 a month I want to know about it straight away - I don't want to be told when it's hit £750.\"\nPhone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said. \"We alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers,\" he added.\nTelecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said: \"Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary. \"So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach.\" The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.\nGavin Patterson, group managing director for BT Consumer, said \"We do look at customer's calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. \"We're looking at the moment at whether we can improve this.\" But as BT handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was \"quite a task in itself\", he added. The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. At the moment, it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down.\nI use free anti-virus software (AVG) and free firewall protection (ZoneAlarm). Both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter's love of music sites. How about ISPs informing all customers of such facilities? The responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues.\nIgnorance is and always has been an expensive business.\nDoes any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised? The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ?\nThese diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal MP3s, porn and pirated software. If people didn't visit such sites they'd be considerably less at risk. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? It seems everyone has to be a 'victim' these days!\nPart of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. A secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user's knowledge.\nThese scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. They should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. Or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going?\nWhy don't BT et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request? To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. After you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions, they cannot insist on you paying the bill. To do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. No customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills.\nDisable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. Or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. You would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your PC? Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault!\nI was very impressed with our phone company recently. I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number. Great service. And I got the tickets as well!\nI have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. Three months later another huge bill of over £1,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place. Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.\nI have been scammed of £139. The operator will do nothing about this and, to add insult to injury, I was charged VAT by the government.\nPremium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.\nI know people who have run up large bills, despite being IT-literate. From talking to BT in Belfast, I believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. It's not the fault of phone companies, and at last they are doing something about it.\nIt's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! Not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly.\nI haven't \"fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam\" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. In most cases the user is entirely at fault, which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them.\nMy telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal £3 to £5, to £320. This was because of the scam. They simply billed me. What particularly galls me, over and above having over £300 stolen, is that the supplier and the government (through VAT) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses.\nHow about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted? That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. At least any disputed amount would be limited, far easier for a telecoms operator to write off £20 than it is £750.\nA few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection.\nHow about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date? That should prevent the vast majority of these scams.",
    "Shares in Cairn Energy, a UK oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.\nThe company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable. Cairn's shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year. Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he was \"disappointed\" with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan. Investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a \"significant downgrade of the initial expectation\".\nCairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. The company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; £10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. A spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field's current value.\n\"Cairn refutes the government's position,\" Mr Gammell said. He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - India's state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - and not the contractor. \"We have a pretty strong legal case here,\" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statements though. The shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. \"I think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,\" said analyst Jason Kenney at ING.\nThe disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for Cairn's existing oilfields. The company raised targets for its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in India from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. \"These two fields will provide the core of the future developments in Rajasthan,\" Mr Gammell said. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to South Asia from interests in the US and Europe. Cairn, which also operates in Nepal and Bangladesh, was catapulted into the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.",

Sony has billed the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan.

    "Shares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had deepened to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m.\nThe UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and \"operating flaws\" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.",
    "Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan has praised striker Robbie Fowler for his landmark return to form.\nThe 29-year-old, out of favour at City earlier this season, took his Premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in Monday's 3-2 win at Norwich. \"He is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did,\" Keegan said. \"He has worked hard to get back to where he is now.\" The former Liverpool striker, who moved to City in 2003 after a poor stint at Leeds, has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season.\nFowler overtook Les Ferdinand on Tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the Premiership, with 151 goals, and he only trails Alan Shearer (250) and Andy Cole (173). And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward. \"He can get better if we can supply him better,\" added Keegan. \"People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face.\" Fowler's double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards. \"I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington,\" he said. \"His team have got great character, they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm. \"I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership. \"The stadium and the atmosphere is great, it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know.\"",
    "Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, D dal Maso, P Griffen, M Barbini, KP Robertson.\nG Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.\nR McBryde, J Yapp, I Gough, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, K Morgan.\nAndrew Cole (Australia).",
    "Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner.\nGlobally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly \"must-have\" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.\nCamera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.\nMobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.\nImages from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.\nThe exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said.",
    "David Beckham expressed his relief at Real Madrid's passage to the Champions League knockout phase.\nAfter Real's 3-0 win at Roma, the England skipper admitted another season of under-achievement would not be tolerated at the Bernabeu stadium. Beckham said: \"It's expected of Madrid to get through, but it's a relief for the club and players to have won. \"We lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything.\" Real's finish as runners-up in their Champions League group means they cannot face his old club Manchester United in the next round. But Real could be drawn against other Premiership hopefuls, Arsenal or Chelsea, who won their respective groups. \"It's going to be great whoever we play, even if we don't get either of the two English teams.\"",
    "Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.\nThe Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets. The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current £7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.\nFor many deaf people, especially those born deaf, BSL is a first and preferred means of communication.\nUntil now, the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator. \"In the past, I've used textphones but they have problems,\" said Robert Currington who is taking part in the pilot. \"I communicate in BSL; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message.\" \"I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply.\" The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call. \"There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people,\" said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels. \"In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. \"By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group.\"\nOfcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. And new technology, including the Video Relay Service, will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. But a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation. \"Any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider,\" he said. Mr Currington, like many of the UK's 70,000 BSL users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available. \"The relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure,\" he said. \"I can show my emotions more easily in BSL in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls.\"",
    "Pop singer Delta Goodrem has scooped one of the top individual prizes at the first Australian MTV Music Awards.\nThe 21-year-old singer won the award for best female artist, with Australian Idol runner-up Shannon Noll taking the title of best male at the ceremony. Goodrem, known in both Britain and Australia for her role as Nina Tucker in TV soap Neighbours, also performed a duet with boyfriend Brian McFadden. Other winners included Green Day, voted best group, and the Black Eyed Peas. Goodrem, Green Day and the Black Eyed Peas took home two awards each. As well as best female, Goodrem also took home the Pepsi Viewers Choice Award, whilst Green Day bagged the prize for best rock video for American Idiot. The Black Eyed Peas won awards for best R 'n' B video and sexiest video, both for Hey Mama. Local singer and songwriter Missy Higgins took the title of breakthrough artist of the year, with Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian taking the honours for best pop video. The VH1 First Music Award went to Cher honouring her achievements within the music industry. The ceremony was held at the Luna Park fairground in Sydney Harbour and was hosted by the Osbourne family. Artists including Carmen Electra, Missy Higgins, Kelly Osbourne, Green Day, Ja Rule and Natalie Imbruglia gave live performances at the event.",
    "Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.\nInvestors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia's listed firms. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,\" said ABN Amro's Eddie Wong. \"[But] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.\"\nIndia's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\nThailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\nIn the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.\nHowever, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. \"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. \"The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.\"",
    "Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final.\nThe home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.\nAfter 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.\nThe Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. \"It's awesome,\" said Hewitt. \"I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. \"I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. \"I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance.\" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. \"I'm usually pretty money in those,\" said Roddick. \"Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. \"I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted.\" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. \"It just took one jackass to shout out,\" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was \"very respectful\".",
    "Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.\nHe told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell said the country's health rates were \"lamentable\" not least because of smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\n - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \n - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \n - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500 \n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \n - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. \n \nMr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.\" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: \"Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.",

    "Carlos Moya described Spain's Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA's challenge in Seville.\nMoya made up for missing Spain's 2000 victory through injury by beating Roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"I have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day,\" said Moya. \"All my energy has been focused on today. \"What I have lived today I do not think I will live again.\" Spain's only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia. And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: \"The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset. \"Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way. It helps me reach my goals if I am obsessed. \"It's really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.\" Spanish captain Jordi Arrese said: \"Charly played a great game. It was his opportunity and he hasn't let us down. \"He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him. \"He had been waiting years to be in this position.\" Spain's victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.\nAged 18 years and 185 days, the Mallorcan became the youngest player to win the Davis Cup. \"What a great way to finish the year,\" said Nadal afterwards. US coach Patrick McEnroe wants Roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. \"I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.\" \"Obviously it's unrealistic to say that we're going to just start playing constantly on clay, with the schedule. \"But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff,\" said McEnroe. Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville's Olympic Stadium. \"It's just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world,\" said the American. \"I had my chances and just didn't convert them. The bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. \"They came out, took care of business and they beat us. It's as simple as that.\"",
    "A senior Tory MP has criticised agriculture department Defra's \"lackadaisical\" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.\nPublic accounts committee chairman Edward Leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The National Audit Office said Defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. But Mr Leigh said the department was \"dragging its heels\".\nThat comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. He also said Defra had been \"dreadfully slow\" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.\nThe outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the UK up to £8bn. \"Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and £40m of invoices remain unpaid,\" Mr Leigh said. Mr Leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an IT system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.\nMinisters had hoped to get £900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. That was because the UK had valued the culled animals at between \"two and three times\" the commission's assessment of their likely market value. National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. On the issue of the unpaid invoices, Sir John said Defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001, \"but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations\".\nMr Leigh said being \"better prepared\" would also help avoid the need for \"mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak\". A Defra spokesman said: \"We welcome the report. It acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak. \"However, the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.\"",
    "Microsoft has entered the desktop search fray, releasing a test version of its tool to find documents, e-mails and other files on a PC hard drive.\nThe beta program only works on PCs running Windows XP or Windows 2000. The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded with firms touting programs that help people find files. Search giant Google launched its desktop search tool in October, while Yahoo is planning to release similar software in January.\n\"Our ambition for search is to provide the ultimate information tool that can find anything you're looking for,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president at Microsoft's MSN internet division. Microsoft's program can be used as a toolbar on the Windows desktop, the Internet Explorer browser and within the Outlook e-mail program. The software giant is coming late to the desktop search arena, competing with a large number of rivals. Google has already released a desktop tool. Yahoo is planning to get into the game in January and AOL is expected to offer desktop searching early next year. Small firms such as Blinkx, Copernic, Enfish X1 Technologies and X-Friend offer tools that catalogue the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer. Apple will release a similar search system for its computers called Spotlight that is due to be released with the Tiger operating system.",
    "US hip-hop duo OutKast have capped a year of award glory with three prizes at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.\nThey won best group, best video and best song for hit Hey Ya! after getting five nominations. R&B singer Usher won best male and best album for Confessions, while UK rock band Muse were named best alternative act and best British artists. OutKast will add their awards to the four they won at the US MTV Awards in August and three Grammys in February. Not only was Hey Ya! one of the biggest global hits of last year, but OutKast have been widely acclaimed as one of the most exciting and innovative acts in music. Their double CD album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which saw Andre 3000 and Big Boi each produce one disc, was hailed as the album of 2003 by many critics.\nAndre 3000 thanked fans \"for supporting OutKast throughout the years\". \"We really appreciate it,\" he said. \"I hope you don't get tired of us, but we only do what we do.\" Also competing for best group had been the Beastie Boys, the Black Eyed Peas, D12 and Maroon 5. And Anastacia, Britney Spears, Maroon 5 and Ludacris had been on the shortlist for best song.\nOutKast did lose out in the contest for best album - which was won by Usher, another award favourite. Usher, who performed a duet with Alicia Keys, also beat off competition from Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly and Robbie Williams to take the best male crown. He had four nominations going into the ceremony, with seven artists nominated in three categories.\nEminem's group, D12, were surprise winners in the best hip-hop category, beating the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nelly. Eminem told the crowd: \"D12 finally won an award, thank you very much.\" The rapper opened the show with a performance of his songs Like Toy Soldiers and Just Lose It, for which he was joined on stage by a crowd of children. The Black Eyed Peas - who had a global hit with Where is the Love? - picked up the prize for best pop act, beating Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams and Britney Spears. Spears was named best female, sending a message of thanks on video saying the award \"means so much to me\". Alicia Keys, Anastasia, Avril Lavigne and Beyonce Knowles had featured alongside her in that contest.\nLinkin Park singer Chester Bennington described their prize for best rock band as \"quite an honour\" while Muse said their win for best alternative act was \"a real surprise for us\". Muse were also named best UK and Ireland act, ahead of Franz Ferdinand, Natasha Bedingfield, Jamelia and The Streets. Referring to the fact that winners of 11 of the 12 main awards were from the US, Muse singer Matt Bellamy said: \"There needs to be more European bands.\" The 11th annual awards were hosted by hip-hop artist Xzibit and watched by 6,000 people at the Tor Di Valle arena, plus millions more on TV around the world. The ceremony featured performances from the Beastie Boys, who entered the stage on bicycles and skateboards, No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani being lowered from a giant clock and Nelly doing a duet with Pharrell Williams. MTV also organised a huge open-air concert featuring Anastacia and The Cure outside the Italian capital's ancient Colosseum, with some estimates putting the attendance there at 200,000. Last year's big winner at the MTV Europe Awards, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, was Justin Timberlake, who walked away with three trophies.",

But Dallaglio, who called time on England earlier this year, said: \"I assure you I wouldn't let anyone down. \"I know what it takes and what I have to offer,\" he told the Daily Telegraph. Dallaglio toured South Africa with the Lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to Australia three years ago.\nThe 32-year-old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf-life.

    "The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.\nAgriculture Minister Adamu Bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; £591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.\nCocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. \"People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,\" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. \"The farmers in the village never see any assistance,\" he added.\nAt the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.",
    "Germaine Greer has criticised Celebrity Big Brother's \"bullying\" of housemates after quitting the reality TV show.\nShe said \"superior\" bullying tactics, like making housemates cold and hungry, could encourage playground bullying. She also condemned the \"complete irresponsibility\" of adding Brigitte Nielsen's former mother-in-law Jackie Stallone to the house on Monday. Nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children, Greer said. The feminist writer and broadcaster said Big Brother had behaved \"like a child rather than a parent\" by taunting contestant John McCririck after denying him a cola drink. \"I thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground,\" Greer said. She also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking \"agendas\".\n\"I had no idea who would be in here and it's wrong for me to present myself in the same context as they are.\" Media observers had been surprised by Greer's initial decision to join the third celebrity version of the Channel 4 reality TV show, given that she has written critical articles about the format in the past. As she packed her suitcase to leave the house she told fellow housemates: \"I'm leaving over specific issues, but best for everyone if I don't discuss them. \"I have a problem with decisions, I make them fast and when I make them, I stick to them.\" Greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against Big Brother.\nOther celebrities to walk out of a reality show TV include Sex Pistol John Lydon, former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook and ex-E17 singer Brian Harvey who all left I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Previous Big Brother housemates to leave before their time were Sunita Sharma and Sandy Cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.\nVOTE   Was Germaine Greer right to leave Celebrity Big Brother?   Yes  No   Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion\nHappy Mondays dancer Bez is now 2-1 favourite to win the show, followed by Blazin' Squad singer Kenzie at 5-2 and actor Jeremy Edwards at 4-1. Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush said that the series was still \"wide open\", adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on McCririck slashing his odds to 8-1. DJ Lisa I'Anson is the outsider with odds of 40-1, while Jackie Stallone, who joined the house on Monday, is also one of the less popular housemates at 20-1. The first eviction of the series has now been postponed after Greer's exit unexpectedly reduced the number of competitors. The eight remaining contestants are competing for a £50,000 prize, to be donated to the charity of their choice, if they survive a series of public votes. For every 50p vote cast by viewers by telephone or text during the programme's run, 9p will go to a tsunami charity appeal.",
    "Tony Blair has pledged to \"never, ever, ever\" attack Tory leader Michael Howard over his Jewish beliefs.\nThe prime minister told the Jewish Chronicle: \"If you look at what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically.\" Mr Blair also distanced himself from recent Labour campaign posters featuring Mr Howard, which critics claimed were \"anti-Semitic\". These were \"not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the Jewish community,\" Mr Blair insisted.\nOne poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs. Another pictured the Tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said echoed the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.\nOthers compared the image to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. Labour has since taken the designs of its website, saying members had preferred other designs. During his interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Mr Blair said: \"I've been a very strong supporter of the Jewish community and Israel, and will always be so.\" Pressed on whether he would draw attention to Mr Howard's Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, he replied: \"The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. It's untrue. \"If you look what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically. I would never, ever, ever attack him on that basis.\"\nMr Blair also defended his party's attitude towards the Jewish community, pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the Holocaust Memorial Day. He added that Labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism.\nNeither the Conservatives nor the Liberal Democrats wished to comment on Mr Blair's words. The prime minister was speaking as London's Labour mayor Ken Livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a Jewish reporter from the city's Evening Standard newspaper. Mr Blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter, Oliver Finegold, to a concentration camp guard. Mr Livingstone \"should have withdrawn the comment immediately\" once he realised the journalist was Jewish, said Mr Blair. \"I'm sure that is what in truth he wants to do. Well, he should do it.\" Mr Livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made, and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper. He conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.",
    "Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venice's famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.\nViotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milan's La Scala and the Vienna State Opera. His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet's Manon last week.\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich's Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet's Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi's La Traviata and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos.\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti's debut at the New York's Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy's La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti's last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Vienna State Opera.",
    "Legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the man credited with developing \"total football\", has died aged 77.\nReferred to in the Netherlands as \"the General\", Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Cup - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Germany. However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final. Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971. His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world. The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football. Michels had recently undergone heart surgery and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: \"He was one of the best coaches we had in history.\" The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, named coach of the century by world football's governing body Fifa in 1999, also won five caps for the Netherlands as a bruising centre forward. Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp said: \"He was the man who, together with Cruyff, made Dutch football big.\"",
    "The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.\nStaff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered. US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.\nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand \"what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath\".\nAdding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate \"sickout\". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.\nUS Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.\n\"US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,\" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was \"embarrassed by the situation\" and \"deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,\" The probe will focus on the industry's compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair \"deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline's crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,\" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.",
    "Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else's agenda.\" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can't change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves.\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn't going to be there in New York, that's been taken out of the equation.\" \nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.\"",
    "The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.\nRates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August. Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.\nRising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.\n\"Today's no change decision is correct,\" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"\nMr Frost added: \"The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"\nOn Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\n\"So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. \"However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.",
    "Germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.\nGross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. It is the nineteenth month in a row that the ECB has not moved borrowing costs. Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.\n\"During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,\" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt. \"If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.\" Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. They have also warned there are more cost cutting measures on the horizon.",
    "Tony Blair has launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a \"ludicrous improbability\".\nThe prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure. Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut £35bn in \"wasteful\" spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts. On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing \"inefficiencies\" which had \"burgeoned\" under Labour. In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.\n\"I believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government.\" Mr Blair added: \"They, the Conservatives have learned nothing.\" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed.\nMr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. \"So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight.\" In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education. \"Everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,\" he said. Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for \"huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy\". \"The public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a Tory government,\" he concluded.\nGordon Brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny. Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be \"distracted or diverted\". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: \"We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.\"\nMr Brown warned that the Tories were planning \"the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto\". Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of \"misrepresenting\" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans. \"He still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools, hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,\" Mr Letwin said. \"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans?\"",
    "British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.\nThe Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. However the YouGov poll, which questioned 1,943 British adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. Only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. Another 7% said they would not vote at all. The poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006. The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.\nBallot papers in the poll will ask: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?\" The government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.\nThe treaty was signed by all 25 current EU members in Rome last October and is due to come into force in November 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled. Mr Straw, along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote. Meanwhile, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\".",
    "Ray Charles, who has won a string of posthumous Grammy Awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.\nHis sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent UK beat and R&B scenes.\nCompared in stature to Elvis Presley by some commentators, Charles' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison. His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the \"devil's\" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.\nWithout Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett. He was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock 'n' roll greats, including I've Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What'd I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael's sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack.\nHe also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of Hank Williams standards such as Your Cheating Heart and You Win Again. More than 40 years after its release, his 1962 ABC album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is still regarded as a classic. His version of Don Gibson's I Can't Stop Loving You topped the pop and R&B charts in the US. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People.\nOn it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a \"brother in every sense of the word\". \"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did,\" he said. Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes. \"I'm quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,\" he told BBC News Online. \"I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever.\"",

Warriors' goalkeeper Murambadoro, who made a name for himself at the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia, helped Bnei Sakhnin overcome Albania's Partizani Tirana 6-1 in the previous round. Murambadoro moved to Israel recently after a brief stint with South African club Hellenic. The club won the Israeli Cup final last season and are based in Sakhnin, which is near Haifa.

    "The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.\nShe told the Guardian newspaper there would be no \"Las Vegas-style\" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes \"a pile of pants\". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. \"You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate Blackpool. They are in it to fill their boots,\" Mr Pound told the Today programme. \"I just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. And over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,\" he said.\nMs Jowell complained of the \"scale of misrepresentation\" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. The culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to \"protect children and the vulnerable\" in a swiftly changing sector. Ms Jowell insisted: \"We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing.\" And continued: \"We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way.\" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday. In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.",
    "The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor.\nNew owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers. It also plans to develop a \"worldwide entertainment concept\" with the brand, although details are not yet known. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.\nIn the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.\nThe Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.\nTulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run. The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m.",
    "The 2005 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is a geek's paradise with more than 50,000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event.\nTop gadgets at the show are highlighted in the Innovations Showcase, which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. The BBC News website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005. \n \nOne of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files. The 2.5GB and 5GB circular pocket hard drive from Seagate might help. The external USB drive won a CES best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket. \"It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool,\" said Seagate. \"It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality.\" \"It is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy,\" it said. In the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures. \n \nUniversal Electronics' NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house. It can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. Working with home broadband networks and PCs, the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful, simple interface. Paul Arling, UEI chief, said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. He said the Nevo gave people a simple, single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. The Nevo won two awards at CES, one as a Girl's Best Friend award and another for innovation, design and engineering. The gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (£425). \n \nHotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its Solo Chassis gaming chair. The specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own \"space\". It is compatible with all the major games consoles, DVD players and PCs. \"We found that kids love playing in surround sound,\" said Jay LeBoff from Hotseat. \"We are looking at offering different types of seats, depending on the market success of this one.\" The chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos, with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. And a drinks holder. The chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in April and is expected to cost $399 (£211). \n \nSatellite radio is big business in the US. In the UK, the digital radio technology is known as DAB and works on slightly different technology. Eton Corporation's Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US. DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. \"It is for the risqu&#233; consumer,\" said an Eton spokesperson. \"We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.\" The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. In the US is it expected to cost $250 (£133). \n \nThe average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES. This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years' time. One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo's tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months. A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. \n \nWearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. MPIO's tiny digital USB music players come in an array of fashionable colours, taking a leaf out of the Apple iPod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. Slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. Although the pendant design was launched three months ago, the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends. An even dinkier model, the FY500, comes out in May and will store about 256MB of music. The range of players recently won an International Forum design award 2005.",
    "The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\n\"It was a respectable report,\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\n\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\nJob creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.",
    "The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).\nThe Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm, Yugansk, to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. Group Menatep, the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of Yukos, says this was illegal. Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.\nThe Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. It accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk.\nBut critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. According to Menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. \"We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,\" said Tim Osborne, a director of Group Menatep. \"The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today.\"\nMenatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to \"virtually nothing\" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%. According to its Paris lawyer, Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case. But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. \"Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,\" he said.\nYukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep. He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.",
    "Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nThe fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox.\nThe thrust of this year's show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. \"The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,\" Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website. \"It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.\"\nConsumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. \"This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. \"Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,\" said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the \"democratisation\" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple's iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.\nThe CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft's Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January.",
    "Web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.\nThese online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. The most well-known examples include Iraqi Salam Pax's accounts of the US-led war, former Iranian vice-president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign. There are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last November.\nThe blogging movement has been building up for many years.\nAndrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. \"You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before,\" he says. \"And blogs were a key part of that transformation.\" Among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying \"we are sorry\" for George W Bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio. \"We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas,\" he told the BBC News website. \"But they followed the story, they didn't lead it.\"\nSome parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.\nOthers, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content. \"I don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. It is in transition, as society itself is in transition,\" says Mr Nachison. However, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. \"The one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, it is threatened. And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse,\" says Mr Nachison. \"The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't, that's gone forever.\" \"With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.\"\nIt seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.\nBut the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. Tools such as Google's Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog. US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. But experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay. \"We are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other,\" said Mr Nachison. \"And there's going to be bad that comes with the good.\"",
    "China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.\nThe move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. \"Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,\" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website.\nSome of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.\nThe Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.",
    "European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro.\nThe European single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months. Tacit approval from the White House for the weaker greenback, which could help counteract huge deficits, has helped trigger the move. But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden.\nChina is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar. \"Asia should engage in greater currency flexibility,\" said French finance minister Herve Gaymard, after a meeting with his German counterpart Hans Eichel. Markets responded by pushing the euro lower, in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the G7 industrialised countries next week. Early on Tuesday morning, the dollar had edged higher to 1.3040 euros. The yen, meanwhile, had strengthened to 102.975 against the dollar by 0730 GMT.",
    "Most areas of the US saw their economy continue to expand in December and early January, the US Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book report.\nOf the 12 US regions it identifies for the study, 11 showed stronger economic growth, with only the Cleveland area falling behind with a \"mixed\" rating. Consumer spending was higher in December than November, and festive sales were also up on 2003. The employment picture also improved, the Fed said.\n\"Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest,\" the Beige Book said. \"Several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels.\" The report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts. \"Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington DC, and New York City, two of the nation's strongest commercial markets,\" the Fed said.",
    "Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.\nMr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair. A private meeting on Monday saw normally loyal MPs warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. It follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.\nThe event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role. But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. Asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, Mr Brown replied: \"You can see that our record on the economy is about the British people trusting us to run the economy.\"\nHe refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. Mr Brown later told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\" Downing Street cited that comment when reporters' suggested Mr Brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe\". Labour's new posters say Britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. They urge voters not to let the Tories take things backwards. Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign \"which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country\".\nConservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: \"The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H.\" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.\nThe prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a \"scorching\" from MPs.\nOn Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: \"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.\" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. \"Of course as a waiter for 10 years I have a professional ability here,\" he joked.",
    "Spectators were evacuated from Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and Real Sociedad.\nMore than 70,000 people abandoned the ground with the score at 1-1 and only three minutes left to play. The Basque newspaper Gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. But after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs, the police said that no explosive device had been found.\n\"The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything,\" said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. \"The best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us.\" Madrid midfielder Guti told private Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: \"I have never seen this before and sport should be above it all.\" Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. It is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand.\nIf the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. Initial reports suggested the Basque separatist group ETA may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. The Bernabeu was targeted by ETA on 1 May, 2002, when Madrid were about to play FC Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. A car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.",
    "Actor Stephen Fry is joining the cast of the forthcoming film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\nFry will provide the voice of The Guide, an electronic book which accompanies the story's hero Arthur Dent on his travels around the galaxy. Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film's executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.",
    "Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club.\nAnelka was quoted in a French newspaper as saying he would like to play in the Champions League for a bigger club. But chairman John Wardle said: \"I've spoken to Nicolas and he's apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the French press. \"We are a big club. Nicolas told me that he agrees with me that we are a big club.\" Wardle was speaking at the club's annual general meeting, where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker. The club still owe French club PSG £5m from the purchase of Anelka in May 2002. He has been linked with a move to Barcelona and Liverpool, and Reds skipper Steven Gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at Anfield. But Wardle added: \"There's been no bids for Nicolas Anelka. No-one has come to me and said I would like to buy Nicolas Anelka.\n\"If a bid comes in for Nicolas Anelka I will speak to the board and then speak to Kevin Keegan. \"If there was a bid and it was a bid of substance and worth taking then between us we'd decide. \"We still owe some money on Nicolas which we have clear out, so it would have to be above that.\" Wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips. He added: \"I've no intention of selling Shaun Wright-Phillips. \"If someone comes with a silly bid I'll have to discuss it. \"But we're not putting him on the shelf to sell. He is the heart and soul of this club and has his heart and sole in this club, and he would be very upset if I put him in the shop window. \"He was an academy kid here, he's just signed a new four-year deal, I don't think he'd do that unless he wanted to play for Manchester City Football Club.\" City recently announced debts of £62m, but Wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the January transfer window. He said: \"Like Kevin I'd like to see some players come in. We've got to see what we can do - whether it's a on a Bosman or not. \"We will try to be creative to generate some funds. But maybe we have to start looking at clubs like Everton and Bolton to see how they have been dealing in the transfer market and do a similar type of thing.\"",
    "The Conservatives would stand up for the \"forgotten majority\", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto.\nThe Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values. In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. Labour says the document offers only a return to a \"failed Tory past\". The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.\nCampaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster. Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto. Other chapters will follow in coming weeks.\nIn a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the \"forgotten majority\" made up the backbone of Britain. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. He says in the manifesto foreword: \"They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair.\"\nSaying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue \"down the path of ever rising taxes\". He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall \"bureaucrats\". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. \"The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,\" he says.\nMr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. Mr Howard told BBC News: \"I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep.\" The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. It had nothing to do with putting \"clear blue water\" between himself and his opponents.\nLabour's election slogan will be: \"Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again\". Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of \"launching Thatcherism in instalments\" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September. \"The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust,\" he said.",

Radcliffe's career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the \"Big City\" marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. \"Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,\" said Radcliffe. \"I don't pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. \"I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. \"It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.\"",

    "Film-maker Spike Lee says black representation is stronger than ever in cinema and TV but the true power in entertainment lies behind the camera.\nThe She Hate Me director urged students at his old Atlanta university, Morehouse College, to seek \"gatekeeper positions\" behind the scenes. Lee told them to \"work up the corporate ladder because everybody can't be an actor, everybody can't make a record\". He spoke as part of a discussion panel, then led a retrospective of his films.\nReturning to his old university, which educates only African American students, Lee discussed the challenges facing black people in the entertainment industry. \"Even Denzel (Washington), he's getting $20m a movie. But when it comes time to do a movie, he has to go to one of those gatekeepers,\" Lee said. He told aspiring young film-makers in the audience not to ignore non-traditional routes to getting a movie made, including raising funds independently and releasing films straight to DVD. \"It's a huge market,\" the 47-year-old director said. \"It's not something that should be looked upon as a stepchild.\" Lee has made more than 25 films, including Jungle Fever, Do the Right Thing, Summer of Sam and 1986 hit She's Gotta Have It.",
    "Your computer can now help solve the world's most difficult health and social problems.\nLaunched this week, the World Community Grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems. The donated processor cycles will help the WCG create virtual supercomputers via the net. The idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop PCs. One of the most successful collaboration projects was Seti@home, run by the Search for Extra Terrestrial Life project, which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication.\nAnyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the WGC website. Once installed, the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process, and reports back after completing that task. The first WCG problem being tackled will be the Human Proteome Folding Project, which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold.\nThe subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences, and technology. The body will evaluate proposals from leading research, public and not-for-profit organizations, and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year. Organisations also represented on the board include the United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organisation.\n\"The World Community Grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues,\" said Elain Gallin, program director for medical research at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. \"[It] will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems\", she added. IBM has donated the hardware, software, technical services and expertise to build the basic infrastructure for the grid.

    "Cult British group Portishead have revealed they are writing their third album, their first in eight years.\nFounding member Geoff Barrow told BBC 6 Music the record was well on the way to being completed. \"We're actually into it as we speak. We took some time off for Christmas, but generally we're doing another record,\" Barrow told the digital radio station. News of their album plans comes after confirmation the Bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam's Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.\n\"We've just had our heads down really, we've never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. \"So for us it just seems, even though we haven't played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven't released a record for a long time.\" Portishead will not play any new material at next month's concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Other acts appearing include Liverpool band The Coral and former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Dummy was a critics' favourite in 1994, hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.",
    "Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.\nNew figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor's 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.\nThe economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.\nMr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. \"The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,\" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. \"But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.\"\nConsumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. \"The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,\" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was \"much less alarming\" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which \"are no indication of broad PPI pressure\", were responsible for the increase, he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said \"it is a good bet these increases won't stick\".",
    "Rock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.\"\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.",
    "I'm seriously really upset at second boss vault of stars. For a pure melee rogue it's next to impossible to help with the ice. Since we're pretty squishy as it is if you're standing on ice for more then. 5 seconds you're dead. That's insane but I can dodge and shit so whatever. But the aoe the boss does for ice just randomly hits after putting a red circle around u. Like it's really hard to dodge as I haven't found its timed at all.. Again I can get past that. What I can't get past is the god damn icicles. It's literally impossible as a melee character to help get your team broken out. The ice surrounding it hits insanely hard which is fucked. So I can't be near it. If I so happen to hit one good encounter and break them out it explodes and kills me. So which leaves me with one option tunnel vision. Which does the job  UT only once every 60 seconds. Ice happens every 20 so wtf am I to do. Help if there is a way",
    "I'm not sure if this has been discussed before, but I wanted to bring it up because it's been a while, and it doesn't seem like this issue has been fixed... Every time and I mean, every single time I paricipate, regardless if I finish 1st or 5th, the game takes me to last place. The  moment i reach the finish line it starts loading and keeps loading until everyone has run \"passed\" me and obviously loaded the finish faster than me.... Is this a thing that's meant to be happening? Recently I actually managed to fishish first for the first time and that was only because everyone else had somehow lagged so much behind me that it managed to load before they finished, which is even more purplexing because it means it's not a techical issue that happens all the time. It seems to be more like a bad design choice.... It's extremily frustrating especially since the run itself is also prety frustrating... Is this an issue worth reporting? Is it my wifi??, I mean it's not good, but that's just unfair... I heard someone else here was having the same issue... Is this how the runs go, do you have to finish like a good minute before everyone else to get first place???",
    "As the title says, I got this extreme feeling of wanting to drink women's milk from her tits. I don't know if there is a link for that, but I always want to do it. Even if she's not pregnant. I want to like keeping sucking till some comes out. Maybe, when I have a wife, I'll be sucking on her tits while she's pregnant with our own baby😂. But, right now, I want to just suck on some female's tit for some milk. Maybe, it's because I wasn't able to do it as a child since I was allergic to a lot of things as a baby, so I couldn't. But, now, I'm fine. I don't care if the woman's tits are small or big. I just want to suck them for the milk🤤😂😂. Like a milk vampire🤣. I'll probably get off just by sucking them dry🤤",
    "Not exactly sure where to post this but I thought this was a good one. I recently moved in with my good friend from high school after graduating college in May. Things are good between us, I have known him since middle school and we get along great. The rough thing is I am and have always been jealous of him. He's a tall attractive blonde guy with natural good looks and I am let's say not that. I have come to terms with not being super attractive a long time ago but it is tough to hear him talk about all the girls he rejects or gets with. He just seems happier than I am with his life, I work IT and make a sizeable salary while he works part time with no degree and takes a nap for most of the day. He just seems better than me at all of our shared hobbies. I don't want these feelings to ruin our friendship because he is a good friend but I find myself getting more annoyed at it after moving in. Any advice?",
    "I finally got around to giving my retriever a bath today after a month. He's been itchy these past few days and I figured a bath would help him. He's prone to itchy skin from time to time due to food allergies to environmental allergies. I used a medicated anti-itch shampoo. Just now my brother started grilling me about what I used to bathe him with to what I used to dry him with after, because he was scratching a lot. I agree, he is still scratching, but no more than he was these past few days. I felt slighted cuz I feel like he's indirectly blaming me for making the dog itchy. And today's my birthday and I chose to spend a quiet day at home relaxing and giving my dogs a bath and my day just got ruined by that. He couldn't keep his mouth shut and blame me tomorrow instead...I'm sorry if I sound petty. I just feel sad suddenly..I wanted a day where I could mentally escape and just let my stress go and he completely ruined it and made me feel bad..",
    "I had zero anxiety about getting this shot, I’m a perfectly healthy 26 year old male. However, I had a terrible experience getting the first vaccine. Two minutes after injection, my ears start ringing and I become lightheaded. Next, my vision starts to blacken and become distorted. This intensified for several minutes and I was sweating an insane amount. At this point I’m freaking tf out because I can’t see nor can I hear and I know I’m like the only person having this experience. I did not flag anyone down I just waited in panic hoping my senses would return. After what seemed like a lifetime, but was only 3 minutes, my vision started to return and I suddenly got freezing although I continued to sweat. I left feeling like I just had intercourse against my will, and I also did not tell anyone at the site. I now feel very reluctant to get the 2nd Pfizer dose and am overall just still shocked I had such a terrible experience. Has anyone experienced something similar? Should I have told someone?",
    "I've only dated one person and I loved her with my whole being and she said the same to me but then she cheated on me and whenever we fought she made me feel like it was my fault. We tried to make it work but she kept talking to him behind my back and then she started to distance herself from me broke up with me and immediately fucked around with him saying that she didn't love me anymore when a week before she was saying how much I meant to her. Couple months later they stopped being together and we got together again after talking for a while and she said she started to like me again but then suddenly completely stopped talking to me saying she realised she didn't miss me that much and then blocked me everywhere and seems to be with him again. I don't know what I feel, I feel used, unlovable and worthless. I get massive panic and anxiety remembering everything and I've tried to kill myself three times and two times had to be taken to the hospital. She's the only person that's actually made me feel loved. It's like I have no value or reason to be respected.",
    "I’ll try to be as brief as possible: I was diagnosed with depression around five years ago, when I was only 17, after I tried to commit suicide. As a consequence, I started seeing a therapist while also taking medications. And I actually saw some improvements. However, Everything went downhill Two years ago, when my mother passed away. She was the person I loved the most in the world, and the only one who never made me feel guilty about my problems, so because I am dumb as fuck I just disappeared, never contacted my therapists again, stopped my medications, and moved to London while also taking drugs and leading a very wild life until I almost killed myself. I have now come home for nearly one year, and I made the hard decision of starting therapy again. Last week I went to see a psychiatrist that a friend of mine suggested me to see. After he asked me a few questions whose answers I am not sure he understood since he kept interrupting me, he told me, “Listen to me, kid, you are not sick, or depressed, look at yourself, you are all pretty and dolled up, you are probably just sad because your mum died, you simply need to toughen up and get over it, and you’ll be fine” I Was shocked. I left his office crying, and now I am totally at a loss. Should I give up on therapy? Should I see thiS guy again and give him a second chance? I don’t know what to do.. maybe I am just destined to be miserable.",
    "I am 16 and own a 66/80cc 2 cycle motorized bicycle I recently came across an issue with my carburetor leaking fuel due to the float needle not stopping the flow of gas coming from my tank, therefore, causing the carb to overflow. I did not know how to fix this issue so I installed a flow valve on my fuel line with the flow valve installed I can turn on and off the gas flow to the carb. To fix my issue I turn on the fuel valve thus allowing gas to flow into my carb and once the carb starts to leak I turn it off, now that I have my carb filled with gas I can ride my bike for about 2 to 3 miles before running out of gas in my carb I then fill it back up by turning on my fuel valve. I know this is not the best solution and am probably decreasing my engine's life span but it is all that I came up with. I then thought why not get rid of my gas tank altogether and just oversize my carb's float bowl. Please let me know what you guys think of this idea and if I should patent it or not.",
    "Just something that came to me recently while thinking of the past games I've played. My first console game was My Street for the PS2, which was a fun minigame fest with games like RC Kart, Dodgeball, and Volleyball. I spent so many hours playing My Street with my brothers and even just by myself against the CPUs. And looking at the games I like now, I can say My Street has definitely influenced my preferences. I love games like Mario Party and Mario Kart, and the LittleBigPlanet series was one of my favorites to play and explore all the custom worlds other players made. So I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences with their first video game and their video game preferences.",
    "I started self harm from 6th grade. It got to a point where even if a tiny problem would arise in my life, I would turn towards my razor. It was my guilty pleasure and it turned into an addiction. I couldn't function at that point without this. Fast forward a few years later, and I'm trying to give up my addiction. It isnt easy and 4 to 5 months pass and I get stressed to a point that I cannot handle it and I relapse. I've been thinking that whenever this happens, I look towards my razor, but should I instead go for Vaping? I know my parents will never allow it because I live in a society where mental health is disregarded and mental disorders are not real. But still, if I were to ever get my hands on a vape, should I? I get stressed like that once every 4 5 months so I will not be smoking constantly. However I will still have an exit ready for me. Is it worth it?",

Having  a good enough body but just a smaller chest with inverted nipples , he made me feel little about my 2 insecurities and never enough . I still held on until now but I’ve begun to question is it worth it ? Will someone love me better ?

    "Sooo you know how every character has 3 lives in the Dream Smp? How did they get those 3 lives in the first place? What if the second and third lives are just copies of the FIRST life. You may say this makes no sense but how do you just die and come back all fine with all your memories? Also there is a book called the revive book on the server which only dream possesses and has been used TWICE. Once on Tommy and once on Henry his pet cow. Which shows that the revive book can be used multiple times and the person you used it on gains all their memories after revival. So what if you can revive the \"copies\" or your \"lives\" that you have lost through the revive book basically creating infinite copies of you with all your memories. I mean they have to go some where right? The dead have to go somewhere RIGHT? Comment on this post if you think this theory is viable or its just bs. Also I have another question that is how or who created/found the revive book and gave it to Jschlatt who then gave it to Dream?",

While we were FaceTiming each other, one of her guy friends asked to call her and she asked me if it was ok for her to answer.

    "So I've recently finished The Betrayal of Jimmy and played halfway through Jimmy's Vendetta. The missions are actually awful and some are even ripoffs of the main storyline, the Chinese restaurant shooting for example. Also what does it mean that they are in an alternate timeline? Why does the Mafia universe have different timelines? There also isn't any real lore, which was the strength of the main campaign. Instead we got a few scenes and a character we know very little about and isn't even connected to anything in the main story. The only positive thing to say is that you can explore the open world after the campaign is finished, which is one of my few points of criticism in the main storyline. How can those DLCs be so bad and boring. Should I even try to continue or should I cancel playing them? Also what about Joe's Adventures? Is it also worth playing, or is it as bad as the Jimmy DLCs?",

It's stupid but I thought of using text to speech and just having a static image of my face, but i can't even do that cause the text to speech for my language is horrible.

I really like the owner and wouldn't want to screw him over when the time does come to leave. When accepting a new position, how do you go about the whole two week notice thing? Are employers actually cool with saying,\" Oh I can start in two weeks.\"? It feels to me like an employer might be upset or go with someone else if you can't start soon/immediately, but that may not really be the case in the professional world.

    "Title pretty much explains it all, my cat hates his wet food. I know wet food is much better for cats than the dry stuff, but my little guys just won’t eat it 95% of the time, I put it out and he turns his head an walks away. I’ve tried many many different types of food, and he doesn’t like any of it. He absolutely loves the dry stuff though, sits there and meows and begs for it constantly. After a while of him not eating the wet stuff I usually end up caving and giving him the dry stuff cause, obviously, I don’t want him to starve. I know cats are supposed to eat the wet stuff, that’s where they get most of their fluids from and it’s just better in general, so I’d like to get him to eat it, but he just outright refuses most of the time. On the rare occasion he does eat it, he’ll just eat like half and then leave the rest. What the heck can I do? Should I just give up on the wet stuff and only give him dry? He does have a fancy little water fountain that I see him drinking out of, so I know he isn’t dehydrated, but the lack of eating good food is a bit concerning. He’s about 5 years old, and has kind of always been this way, but recently has gotten worse. I even bought him some special bowls because I was worried it might be whisker fatigue, but that hasn’t helped either. If anybody had any advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",

All I could think of was you. I wish I could take you out for eel sushi, and I’d get your favorite beer, and your favorite bread. It would be so worth it to know you’re eating properly and see the huge smile you get on your face whenever you have your favorite food. We could do something really special together. Now thinking of that money opens up a pit in my stomach I’ve tried to think of something else to use it on but it all pales compared to you.

I hope no one said anything rude. I pray for your safety every day. I can never stop loving you, and I don’t think I’ll ever climb out of this dark pit.

    "So I’ve been learning the basics of forex and when to take trades through IM academy. Basically I know more or less when to take a trade through hourglass using the Cashtrap strategy. It shows you possible trades you could take. The educator says that just using indicators on hourglass you could win 60-70% of your trades. I’ve learned the point system they use to have more confirmations to know whether or not a trade is good to take or not. The problem I’m having is that the educators seem to kinda of repeat themselves over and over and I don’t think I’m learning anything more than what they are saying. They are trying to pass it off as something so simple when in actuality it’s not. I follow the strategy exactly how it was taught but I still seem to lose. I paid a lot of money to learn this and it’s starting to feel like a scam almost. I understand that the market does it’s own thing and you can’t predict right every trade but following everything I’ve been taught I still can’t seem to predict right. I have good and bad days but it’s confusing to know where I should be placing trades and I feel helpless because the educators are on repeat mode every time they go live.",

    "Now I know Victreebel can get swords dance and everything good mainly in postgame of fire red making the only real moveset I want to go with for him is razor leaf, body slam, toxic or acid, and maybe double team or rest. Victreebel isn’t the best in the older gens or maybe he is I have no idea. But I’d love to know what you think maybe I can give him other moves I’m deciding on either him or exeggutor and I really don’t know what else to use the rest of my team is gonna be Charizard, Primeape, Lapras, Raichu, and Nidoking and Victreebel is getting the 6th spot if I can find him viable, this is for ingame only also and I have access to get a bellsprout cause my brother has leaf green, I’d love to hear what you guys think and thanks.",
    "my best friend would always comment on my moms ass, tits, etc. he would always say how he fucks her yk the usual shit. until i came home early from playing basketball and i see my best friends car in the driveway. i go inside and it’s quiet but my moms home bc of covid. i go into her room to ask why he’s here to see my childhood best friend fucking my mom. she hurried for her clothes and that’s when i saw his dick. it had to have been at least 9 inches while i’m only 3 inches. while my moms rushing for clothes he tells her to stop and that he wants to see what’s in my pants. my mom didn’t say anything and neither did i do he came over and choked me against the wall and dropped my pants. he made my own mom take a picture or our dicks next to each other and then told me he wants to keep fuckign my mom. obviously i said no and we were going back and forth until he just holds me down and ties me up with bedsheets. he forced me to watch him fuck my own mom. she loves every part of it and was so surprised to see how much bigger his dick was",
    "I just watched fragment of trash taste how they lambasted Kazuya for that thing with not running after Mizuhara and i m wondering... I know when i started reading i felt he was pain in the ass but kinda understand where all those things he did come from and just gave him some pass. His pervert side is still annoying but i feel like it is author trying to be  funny but failing mostly. Otherwise he is really great later on even this situation when he said sorry to Mizuhara for not running after her made me sad for the guy and later on there where more moments where i really felt some emotions after him trying to open himself or trying to be brave. Is it really that bad in anime or am i just incel feeling bad for other incel ? I felt really down in my life for quite some time so i relate to characters with low self esteem especially this low like Kazuya, because it's uplifting when he tries to fight for himself out there.",
    "Ages ago it has its battery changed; after it wouldn’t turn on with the battery plugged in nor would the battery take any charge. It has done little other than sit since unused since then. Recently I decided I’d try using it so I readied a bootable El Capitan usb as it’s hard drive is completely blank, but the MacBook wouldn’t turn on. I eventually found out that holding down the power button for 10 seconds and then plugging it in continuing to hold down the power button for another 10 seconds. When it does turn on the fans are full blast and whether it’s to El Capitan install, High Sierra install, internet recovery, or the hard drive from a know working MacBook it will only make it a little past halfway before shutting off and coming back on again only to repeat. If it is turned off anyway other than when it shuts itself off the 20 second power button thing has to be done again. I’ve tried an nvram/pram reset and the option+command+shift+power to no avail. On the inside there’s no evidence of water damage. I’ve been trying at it for two days now and I’m out of ideas as to what the problem could be.",
    "I feel so incredibly anxious. I can’t sit still. After a rollercoaster emotionally abusive relationship that lasted two years and after 1 year sharing an apartment together, I moved across the country for a while. After a month of not seeing him, I’m back. I’m seeing him tonight. The level of anxiety I feel is unreal. I can’t sit still for more than a few moments without feeling nauseated with unease. We wanted to meet up to get closure for everything that happened, but it was a toxic relationship. He begged for me back a week ago and has been standoffish the last few days. He told me he’s incredibly depressed and wants to want to seek help, but it seems that he won’t. He’s erratic in his communication and seemingly his feelings toward me. He says he feels like it’s going to be weird to see each other and I feel the same, to an extent. Despite everything he’s done and everything that’s happened, I miss him and am excited to see him. I don’t know whether or not that’s wrong.. people who are close to me tell me that I shouldn’t see him at all. I can’t help but feel drawn to him, even if it’s for the last time. Advice on how to handle this situation?",
    "Started a new job, its kinda scary not physically knowing who your teammates are. I mean chat chat pero iba pa din like 1st day at sabay-sabay kayo kakain, tatawa kayo pag lahat kayo nahihirapan, etc. It kinda feels like on your own dba. Parang zoom meetings feel awkward din, saglint lng and like its kinda different din like having the vibe of someone working beside you and making chikka. Its awkward just inviting people na \"hey magzoom tayo para lng may presensya\" and it doesnt feel the same. Anyone who can give advice on how to handle this scenario? I guess its the feeling of uneasiness din sa new role, new company and before pandemic, hadn't realize the value of having people starting with you.",
    "Their motivation is pretty weak to be honest and Marvel's attempt to connect their motivation with \"The Blip\" makes absolutely zero sense either.  Like what motivated them to do what they do in the show? We got a glimpse of it like wanting the life before the blip to come back and \"blip refugees\". Why are the blip refugees struggling exactly? Why the life after the blip sucks even more? I'm not saying that every single question have to be answered ,but the way they try to make the audience sympathize with the Flagsmashers just doesn't work. Maybe they could have showed us a small glimp of the struggles people faced after the blip and the struggles the blip refugees are going through ,but none of it was hinted properly at all. It was just \"bad\" things that's happening and we're supposed to relate with that suddenly.",
    "I am like 90% sure Isayama was made to make the ending more digestable. Why, you ask? All we have to do is look at the Season 2 ED. EVERYTHING is a reference there, EVEN THE FUCKING BABY is in there. Do you know what was in there that we've never seen? The mass of people wandering away. Those surely had to be the collossals turning back. This in itself is not the reason why many people dislike the ending, but I can surely say that some things were fucked with, and I doubt that that was the only one. I can even imagine some executive telling him literally after 138 that \"yeah man your shits fucked up no way we can have those characters die. figure it out\" Jean and Connie were brought back without even them getting brought back. They just kind of.. appeared? I don't know, maybe it's just my last dose of copium, but I am convinced that this was not that was envisioned.",
    "I am about a month into this hobby. I got myself a giant trance x. I walk with a cane do to a hip injury I received from a motorcycle accident when I was younger. Over the last year I have lost 168 lbs and wanted to strengthen my leg muscles before my hip replacement surgery. I told my doc I want you to have to work to get to my hip after I put on all this muscles lol. My legs were so weak. I started riding a beach cruiser about 8 months ago and was able to build up to a 20 mile ride, but I was limited on where I could go because of not having gears. Now I have open up so many doors with this bike. Me and my brother did our first climb two days ago. Holy crap that was one hell of a workout. It is a 14 mile ride with elevation gains of 2200 feet. We were only able to do like four miles with a gain of like 500 feet. The ride down just from that far up the hill got me hooked. This hill now has become my unfinished quest and i will beat it. It feels so good to have purpose again in my life and to seek out these challenges that are hard instead of running away from the hard things like I use to do.",
    "Title basically. I have an iPod Mini I recently upgraded, swapping out the 4 gig hard drive for a much larger compactflash card and it's eventual home will be a little cabin I'm building on a plot of land out in the middle of nowhere. It's being stuffed full of audiobooks and radio plays, including from my sizable Audible collection. At the moment I'm downloading my books, converting to MP3, splitting into chapters and then putting on the mini. This is mostly automated for me with the toolchain I've put together with shell scripts, but still takes a pretty long time. The mini is compatible with Audible formats 2, 3 and 4 which would greatly simplify things into drag and drop but for the life of me I can't get audible's servers to spit out the old formats. Is it impossible or is there a trick I'm missing?",
    "Just got home from a visit with my GI doc. Wasn’t even a visit, it was more of a lecture. He canceled my GES. I’ve been waiting for it for so long. He says that he found that I am lactose intolerant and that must be what is causing my symptoms. I was on a lactose free diet and I saw no fucking difference. Lactose intolerance isn’t nausea every single moment of your life. Lactose intolerance isn’t eating and vomiting the undigested food a couple hours later. He didn’t even give a shit about how much weight I’ve lost. I was so fucking overweight before my symptoms and now I can barely get it above 105 lbs. I’m not fucking crazy. I went to that appointment so bloated that I looked pregnant. Nobody listens. My mom doesn’t care. My dads a doctor and even HE won’t listen to me. He says he doesn’t want me on gut stimulators because I’m under 18 and they cause abdominal pain. Abdominal pain? That’s my middle name at this point. My mom is calling my primary doctor now to adjust my anxiety meds because I broke down when we left that appointment. Wanna know why I’m anxious and depressed? BECAUSE OF THIS FUCKING HEALTH CONDITION. GOD DAMN IT. What the hell do I do? Do I need to say my symptoms in French since nobody seems to understand them in English? Why won’t anyone listen to me?😭",
    "I know that I am overly quiet in social situations, and that it’s because a lot of the time I overthink anything I might say. Most of the time it keeps me from saying anything at all. I feel like it makes people think I’m stuck up or unapproachable. People tend to fill in the blanks if you know what I mean. A lot of people will say I should try not to think so much and just say the first thing that comes to mind, but the thing is on those rare occasions where I don’t overthink too much and start to get comfortable so I actually talk to people I feel like a lot of the time I’m awkward, and in ways I can’t always quite put my finger on either. Like I put my foot in my mouth or overshare or just say odd things that people don’t know how to respond to. It all makes me cringe and go back into that overthinking mode and I feel socially inept. It makes me want to cry and be a hermit. I don’t know what I’m looking for here, maybe I just need to vent. Any advice is appreciated.",
    "So this post is going to be somewhat of a jumbled mess as I dictated in my car as I’m driving from my iPhone but I just had a thought after reading some news about student loan forgiveness and with all the money that’s been spent through the government I think there’s an agenda in motion to cancel Fiat currency and the future is going to be only a Cryptocurrency somewhat like China just did. the United States will probably create its own so I don’t know where that leaves all the currencies that we have now but I think it’s important that we invest as much as we can into these currency’s now. I can see the US dollar becoming worthless and these things come quicker than we realize it could happen within a year could happen within 10 years we don’t know my advice to everybody is put everything that you feel comfortable putting in the crypto currencies as you can. And thank you for reading this if you did. And please comment your thoughts",
    "Honestly, the storyline I'm most worried about in the show is the shipwreck storyline with Matthias and Nina. All the other storylines in the show, including the crows, tie in to Alina's story, and are all connected. But I feel like, especially for new viewers, the Helnik storyline is just gonna feel like a random shipwreck in a random part of the world with two random characters who we don't really care about and have nothing to do with the main storyline with Alina. I just feel like it will feel a bit random and disconnected to the rest of the plot, especially considering all the other plots are connected. Maybe they have come up with a sensible way to believably tie them together, but even then it doesn't really look like nina and matthias is gonna interact with or even meet any of the other characters, unless it's just one scene at the beginning or the ending. I think I am most worried about the fact that new viewers are gonna be confused and not really care about the storyline at all.",

Because of this I have found cooking and cleaning very difficult, almost impossible.  This had lead to me needing to order out almost every meal. Funds are dwindling and I'm getting extremely overwhelmed. I've been finding it very difficult to even keep trying. I've been in too much pain to effectively  take care of myself.

I feel like I can't even talk to my partner because they keep recommending therapy and while I know they aren't my therapist sometimes I just need to talk to someone. I moved to a new state in order to be with my partner a few years ago and have struggled hard with making new friends, got a better paying but less satisfying job, we're even expecting our first kid soon.

    "I don't want to be like this - I'm too old for this shit. I don't want to spend the rest of my life posting about my heartaches. I don't romanticize heartbreaks. I dont intentionally torture myself with thoughts of you, they just come to me - like a thief in the night, leaving me robbed and helpless. There's nothing sweet about this and I'm far too logical for this. I don't enjoy wracking my brain, trying to find words that would best describe how I feel - and every time failing because no words could really come close to how gut wrenching, soul destroying this is. I put into words how I feel because supposedly it helps - I haven't seen any result yet at all. There's only one thing that would help me - and that only comprises of three letters - YOU. I'm so fed up with myself. I have no fucking illusions, no grandiose dreams of getting back together, of a happily ever after. I've lived in the fairy tale we have created long enough - and I'm living now my reality. I'm tired to my bones of feeling this way...I just want to move on. I'm not harboring any negative thoughts about you or about myself - no blaming, it is what it is. Some relationships are not meant to last, and some people are not meant to be together. That is life and I'm well too aware of it. But fuuuuuck, the pain. I just want it to stop. Now. Not when I'm six feet under the ground and I wouldn't give a fuck at all. I don't want to continue going through this anymore. I have accepted that we are not meant to be. I'm not angry about that. Just please, let me be free of this pain. Cause I just can't anymore.",
    "The entire world hates our guts. They think we're evil and beleive a myriad of bigoted stereotypes about us. Americans are often times sneered at and treated with contempt and disgust abroad for no other reason than being American. I'm not just talking about non-western places like the middleast, Russia or China. Even our so called \"allies\" hate our guts and seek the detriment of our country. Most europeans hate america. Polls consistently show that. Why would i, an american, want to leave my country and go some place where we're despised? And don't say \"it's the government they hate not the people\" because that's false. Your average r/europe user thinks we're inbred unintelligent barbarians. They say the stupidest most ignorant things about our country. They think they're \"ExPeRtS\" on America and americans when they really only know what their propoganda machine media tells them. If the world hates us then I want nothing to do with the world. I'd gladly live in isolation in my home country. Personally, I think the trans-atlantic alliance must end and we should go back into isolationism.",

    "When my son was seven I took him to Dover Castle.  Neither he or I were aware of specific hauntings at the castle prior to the visit.  After a great day we returned home.  On tucking my son up in bed that night we chatted about the day and he asked me about a woman he’d seen dressed in a long red dress.  I thought it odd, although he was clearly not scared but more intrigued by her enough to ask me who she was.    I had not seen anyone matching the description although had been with my son throughout the day.   I thought nothing about it until a day or two later when, out of general curiosity I googled the castle and discovered that it is famous for being haunted with several ghosts one of which was a lady in a long red dress exactly where my son had seen her.",

I just tried another movie tonight and I had it set to direct stream, but it failed converting again. I had the mode set to auto, so I changed it to force and it loaded up super fast but said it couldn't detect any audio. So it played the direct stream 35mbps 4k beautifully, but without sound.

The thing is when I pee I don’t feel any burning it comes out normally. But after I pee i still feel the pain maybe even worse. It also feels like I have to pee when I don’t. It just feels all inflamed and burning inside of there. It’s been going on for I’d say 5-6 days now. The worse part is I’m on vacation and dealing with this sucks, I can’t even relax on vacation. I’ve had a hard time sleeping too. I made a doctors appointment for Monday. I’m just trying to see if anyone else experienced these symptoms.  It was worse when I took CBD too thought it would help. I’ve also been peeing a lot since this started too I guess my body is trying to flush this out if it is something.",

The recent 1.2 patch made it so you can make the “key item” icon on Johnny’s gear disappear by collecting all of his stuff and getting the Breathtaking achievement. Thing is if you decide to upgrade his gear from rare to epic then the epic version will have the “key item” icon and you won’t be able to get rid of them. Same thing if you upgrade the epic version to legendary. What you need to do is upgrade the rare version into epic then epic version into legendary before you get his pistol. Once you get the pistol all three versions in your inventory will have the “key item” icon removed from them. Then you’ll be able to delete them or store them in your stash or do whatever you want with them.",
    "I do group therapy with my family because my family is screwed up especially my dad and brother and every session ends with them blaming me for something and trying to convince the therapist I'm horrible. Recently they talked about how I dont enjoy doing chores, I dont do them because i score very high in school and it's very stressful. My therapist says they need to control me more. Keep in mind this is the person that's supposed to help me. Fast forward a week I pass my learners permit test, this day is probaly the only day I've been genuinely happy in about a month, and when I come home my dad just tells me to take out the trash. I tell him \" I'm eating right now, I'll take it out when I'm done eating\" and my dad is very childish and he likes control. So of course being the lazy fat and impatient dad he is, he says \"no do it right now\" so I say \"listen, i just got my permit, you are not going to ruin this day for me.\" And he says \"take it out by 5 30\". So I take it out because I'm not lazy like him, and now I'm mad and stressed out when I should be happy. I havent been happy for like 2 months and he ruins it. Take your own trash out you imbecile. Time to wait 2 more months to be happy, who knows if he will ruin it that time too.",
    "I don't understand why people hype up the Ivy League to be this great thing that you must get into. I personally didn't apply to any. Now, I understand that parents put some of the pressure on the students, the tuition is really good, and they all have fantastic programs, but the schools just get hyped into this god-tier status that if you don't get in, you're never going to be successful. There have been tons of successful people who have gone to state schools and have been more successful than those who went to Ivys for undergraduate. If you don't believe me, do a quick google search. Furthermore, jobs don't care about where you went to undergraduate. They care about what experience you have. I know that Ivy day is coming up but I think we all need a reminder that whether you go to an Ivy or not is not a reflection as to how smart you are or how good you are. Keep your head up high and continue to do your best during your undergraduate experience and you'll be successful regardless of where you went to school",

For the past three years or so, I have been consistently getting choppy haircuts with chunky layers that need to be fixed every time. I just got a haircut yesterday. The top 2/3 of my hair looks fine, but the bottom third looks about half as thick and very choppy and bizarre. I’m going to have to cut it again. I haven’t been able to grow my hair past shoulder length because this keeps happening. There’s no way that I just have bad luck picking hair dressers. It has to be something about my hair causing this, I just can’t for the life of me figure out why or how. Does anyone have any ideas at all? Has anyone else experienced this?",
    "In my opinion Charmx isn’t leaving. The fact that it still shows that he still has 2.4K videos is pretty fishy, they could all possibly be unlisted or maybe deleted which could suck for him. My second piece of evidence lies between the dates. He posted the first video on March 31st, 2021. A couple hours later he posted a video on charmx2 addressing the same subject as well as on charmx3. Finally, on his “last video”. It was posted a few hours after all the others, March 31st. But the thing is tomorrow is April 1st which all of you know is April Fool’s.

    "Whilst playing in the Great War mod I was loosing a war of attrition. The allies had pushed me back almost to Berlin but then I mounted a massive counter attack on the Eastern front and reached all the way to Stalingrad which capitulated Russia. I was pleased to have so much land after such a long war. However, my happiness was short lived as I was slapped in the face by the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. But still I mounted a western front counter attack and pushed the allies back to the Benelux border. My attacks were green across the bord and the troops I had spent the last year preparing were making short work of the entente. But then suddenly out of nowhere I get hit by the Versailles treaty.

    "Hey everyone, what are some tips and advice on how to make your body smell extremely good 24/7? I would like recommendations from diets to deodorants to which fabric softener or detergent to use to wash your clothes, which product to use on your face and hair, which body wash, body lotions, body oils, perfume, showering technique, dental hygeine, flossing technique, anything, to use to make your body and mouth smell like heaven. I can make my hair smell really good, I use Amike Soulfood nourishing hair mask, Morrocanoil leave-in conditioner, Morrocanoil treatment, and Briogeo Anti-Frizz heat protectant. I have been complimented on the smell of my hair multiple times but I do not know how to make my body smell very good. Does anyone have any good body wash recommendations, body lotions, body oils, or perfumes to make yourself smell really good? Has anyone been complimented on smelling good all the time, and if so, what do you use? I have heard the Yves Saint Lauren perfume is amazing and I will buy that, but I was also thinking of just using something to smell good all the time naturally, not exactly with perfumes all the time. And by smelling good, I mean I really want people to constantly compliment me on how good I smell when they get closer, I am not really talking about just preventing from smelling bad or smelling neutral, or decent, but just smelling really good. Let me know, thank you.",
    "So last night my roommates, some friends, and I were having a good time having a bonfire. I decided to get wonky for the social gathering so I kept going back inside to my room to snort more ket. We have like 5 snakes and my roommate was showing one of our guests her snakes but one of them nudged the heat lamp keeping them warm when they were going back outside to the fire. Some time passes and I decided to go inside and snort some more ket. But when I go inside it smelled like something was burning but I didn't think much of it since we were having a bon fire. I proceeded to my room until I got near the reptile room and saw a bunch of smoke in that area. I freaked out and looked for the source and saw it had something to do with the heat lamp. I was so wonked I really didn't know what was starting to burn and catch on fire but I immediately ran back outside to inform my roommates something was catching on fire. They come inside and fixed the situation. Man, that was a close call. Thank god for my ketamine addiction and that I decided to get wonky af that night. I could've not have a place to live today if I didn't want to go back inside to continue the wonk. I just felt the need to share this with everyone. Thank you guys for listening to my experience last night. That was pretty scary when I finally thought about it.",
    "Our relationship is already stressed, and she is going through that phase everyone goes through where if someone dares correct her or politely inform her that she is making a mistake she blows up. I’ve done everything I can, and managed to find a ten gallon. It used to be in a five gallon, and a ten gallon was all I could find for her considering I’m broke from my own gosh and she wasn’t putting any effort into it. She comes to me with her fish problems but doesn’t listen to my advice when she hasn’t asked for it in regards to her fish’ safety. She told me a couple minutes ago that his stomach was looking a little big, he hasnt been swimming around much any more, and he isn’t eating as much/ at all. Tomorrow morning I convinced her to put him into a smaller container for a bit so I can get a good look at him and take a picture. Any suggestions?",
    "I’m still struggling in some aspects of the therapy. I’ve got the Amara View mask, which is comfortable enough. No problems falling asleep. Not snoring, which is great. AHI is generally between 4 and 8 while I can keep it on. But if the thing, Philips Dreamstation, goes 12 or over, i cannot breath out and end up almost choking on my own air. Doesn’t happen regularly. Maybe 2x in the last 2 weeks. I get a good, solid 3 hours after I initially fall asleep. After that, i’m usually up like at least 2 or 3 times and, recently, take the thing off after i hit about 4.5-5 hours just to get some sort of sleep. I don’t THINK i’m having claustrophobia issues. I’ve never had issues with claustrophobia in any other situations. I’m struggling to function during the day more now than before i started on the CPAP. I don’t know. I’m venting more than anything.",
    "Those of you in condo's and detached homes in Victoria, That have mini split heat pumps. How loud is your compressor unit outdoor? We had a two head unit mini split installed in August and it is loud as heck. The installer came out multiple times. Of course every time they came the unit wouldn't make the noise. It happens more at night and when it's really cold. I know they make noise but I feel like the amount of noise this unit makes is substantially louder than it should be. A friend of ours had one put in by the same installer. And his is whisper quite. I'm at my wits end on what to do. The installer keeps saying it's normal noise. But when the tv volume had to be turned up to drown out the noise of the outdoor unit. I feel like that's excessive.",
    "It gives me extreme anxiety when people come toward me for a hug or high-five. This is because everyone seems to do hugs or high-fives differently. In the milliseconds before someone hugs me, I think through how I will have to hold my arms, if they are going one arm up and one down or both up or both down or a side hug. For high-fives, it’s the same issue. Some people will grab your hand when you high-five, others have a weird pull you in for a hug thing, some grab your hand after slapping it and shake it or something. Anytime someone high-fives me, they look at me as if I am retarded when I try for a normal high-five because I don’t know what sort of weird-ass high-five they will try for. Sorry this is so long.",
    "I bought my first truck recently. It belonged to my dad’s boss who pretty much babies his vehicles. Only he let this sit for about a year. I got a pretty good deal on it considering which I wouldn’t normally do if my dad didn’t trust the guy. I couldn’t take it home at first because we found a fuel line leak. We repaired it and we jumped it and it ran really good. Until it died on an exit ramp. We got it towed home and it hasn’t started since. We’ve replaced the batter and now the ignition coil. It will turn over but it just won’t start. It’s an electrical problem because I’m not getting sparks from the ignition coil, hence the replacement. But still nothing. If I can’t get it fixed, the guy said he’ll take it back and give me my money back but damn I really want this damn thing to start. I hate that I can’t drive it or do anything with it",

    "I think when modeling for games the modifier aspect and the non destructive workflow puts blender above most 3D packages in this regard. One thing that is essential though when working with a high to low poly workflow is keeping the geometry relatively simple and be able to adjust it without having edgeloops around every corner. Maya's crease set tool was very good at that and I wonder why someone has not released an addon for that yet, I would really pay any amount for such tool since it would speed my workflow a lot. Don't tell me that you can do this using vertex groups cause it just doesn't make the cut, is too messy and the values of the crease get lost when you start to have a more complex model. Maybe it is too difficult to create? I would be happy to fund it. Let me know what you think.",
    "Signed up for Fraser’s HWPO app and was looking forward to it but it’s been a complete disappointment so far. Didn’t get a password email like the first email today said I would. Figured out I could do a password reset and get into the app. Got into the app and didn’t have the program in there. Checked back a bit later and it had shown up so got my hopes up that issues were over. Not so much. App is SUPER slow, nothing will load and all I can get to is a list of “Day 1, Day2, etc” if I click them it just spins and loads. Has been a complete let down so far. I’ve used various fitness apps before and all of them have been pretty decent and seem to be built on a pre-canned template app that whatever celeb throws their name on and was expecting similar for this one but not so much. This is like a freshman programming class tried to do a school project and failed at it hard. Anyone else get different results?",
    "Like two months ago I was using my newly acquired prostate vibrator, so to get things into perspective I was laying in my back inside my bed just chilling with the vibrator in while I tried to meditate and then suddenly, out of fucking nowhere a huge wave from my prostate flew through my whole body, it was so fucking pleasurable and only took like 4 seconds it even made me open my mouth as if I was about to moan, never had anything like it again, no cum came out it was just so good, after those pleasurable 4 seconds I thought \"I have no idea of what the fuck that was but I loved it\", that shit is the only reason I am still into prostate play cause after that until now I have felt nothing from it again not even a p wave I think, am I doing something wrong, and for God's sake someone tell me what the fuck that was",
    "One time I went to a party in Dahlonega, we started out at Taco Mac getting really drunk. I started getting really frisky so the two guys I was there with took me out back to where their truck was parked, turn down the music in there truck, and we started our own party. Of course I started taking my clothes off and dancing for everybody that had gathered. I brought one guy up on the bed of the truck with me and started putting his hands all over me. Eventually he started touching me and feeling me up, he took off my pants and started finger me in front of everybody. And his buddy got up on the truck push me down on my knees and stuck its dick in my mouth. They put me down on all fours and spit roasted me for a while... Then other people started climbing on the truck, a few other women took off their clothes and we all started sucking each other. Mostly us girls and the guys watching sucking on each other's tits, licking each other's pussy, trying to fit as many fingers as we could inside each other. But some guys were still up in the truck fucking us and putting bottles in us, and other things they were finding, not quite sure what was inside me at some points. But of course someone had to spoil the fun and eventually the cops showed and threatened to start arresting people if we didn’t pack it up.",
    "So recently all my purchased cards vanished from the client. I believe this had something to do with unlinking my original metamask address. I did this through support after linking my hardware wallet, as nothing has been minted yet I assumed all the cards would be minted to my new address. Apparently I was wrong, support didnt answer my questions about if unlinking my old address would have any negative side effects, they just did it and closed the case. They wont reply now the cards are gone and still havent replied after I made a new support ticket. I have relinked the old address to see if that would bring them back, but nope. Some people on here suggested I try the discord but that hasnt worked either. Starting to feel like I'm up shit creek without a paddle here.",
    "For a couple years now my 2009 v star 1100 was having trouble starting.  I would have to roll on the throttle slightly for it to start.  I recently found out that is a horrible thing to do on the v star.  All my research led me to find out that the tps sensor was the culprit.  To be in spec the tps sensor ohms have to be between 500 and 800.  Mine at its lowest setting was 1150.  I read multiple posts where people paid $165 for a new sensor and its was still out of spec.  The bracket that the sensor screws into is big enough to drill new holes right next to the existing ones so that the sensor can turn more and be within the proper range.  I drilled the new holes and tapped it with an M4 tap with 0.75 pitch.  It worked and the hard starting is fixed.nice to get the old girl back to normal.  I love the V star 1100 but pretty said that Yamaha made the sensor out of spec.",
    "Usually I play on PS4, but I still own my PS3 and recently installed it in the living room so my roommate and I could use it as a dvd player and we could play some old games together. However, when I wanted to let her play Journey, I found out the game disappeared from my ps3, I also cannot find it in my list of purchased games in my PS account either. The only evidence I have of ever owning the game on ps3 is a confirmation e-mail from the PS store when I bought it years ago and some trophies I earned are still listed on my profile. Has the game disappeared for anybody else? Does this have to do with PlayStation ending PS3 support? I apologize if this is not the place to ask this question, but I’m unable to contact PS support in my own country at the moment because they are “too busy”...",
    "Easter night. 98 years old. I got to hold her hand, touch her hair, and kiss her forehead. I got to say goodbye hours before she passed. I took pictures of her photos hanging on her walls, I took in the smell of her bedroom, I walked around her kitchen with family one last time. It was such a beautiful day, perfect weather, the sun was shining, birds were chirping. My aunt said to me \"when I hear the birds sing, I'll always remember mom.\" It broke my heart. I love my grandma. I love my family. Every family has its problems, I learned so much just from sitting and listening to my aunts and uncle talk that those problems just didn't matter. We are family. They had so much wisdom and love to give to me. They knew I wasn't very close with her, but they let me sit as long as I needed with her. I'm so happy I didn't wait any longer to see her. My brothers didn't get to say goodbye, only me. I feel lucky to have looked into those blue eyes one last time. I know she loved me and I love her. Rest easy Nan, tell Papa and Nick we love and miss them dearly.",
    "My son just turned 5 a couple of weeks ago. We always give kisses and hugs but I told him for awhile now that I don't want him to kiss me on the lips. I use the term inappropriate because it's the best way I know how to put it for him to understand. He sees me kiss my husband tonight and he said that I shouldn't kiss daddy on the lips. I explained that because mommy and daddy are husband and wife that it's okay. I told him that if he ever gets a wife, he can kiss her on the lips too. And he simply said \"or him\". I told him that is exactly right. He can love whoever he loves. I'm so proud that he even thought to say that because he has been around a few trans people but never a gay couple before. Love is love little dude. ❤",
    "Fast food has some kind of backroom deal with the pickle industry. Notice the hamburger pickle chips sold at the store are far thicker than the pickles on fast food burgers? They are also packed in a weaker brine, so the thick consumer chips require much higher brine content to maintain the pickle flavor. So while fast food gets paper thin, moist but not drenched, just as flavorful pickle slices: consumers are left with thick, sloppy pickle chips. It affects the profile of the burger. How many times has pickle juice washed your toppings off your burger, left your burger too high profile to add the other toppings you wanted, made such a mess with all the juice that anything else on your plate was ruined, or just made it impossible to hold your burger together with a couple of 1/3\" thick sponges slipping around on top drenching everything anytime you tried to grip it? If consumers had access to fast food pickles, they wouldn't rely on the fast food industry for low profile, topping worthy, manageable burgers. How entrenched is this conspiracy? Go to your local deli, buy one of those boars head pickles they have sitting in a jar on the counter, ask the guy to slice it thin with the deli meat slicer. They won't do it. Or go to Sam's Club and try to find fast food style pickles. You won't. All they offer is the thick consumer quality ones you can get at the grocery store. Even though their target customer is small business owners, they know regular consumers shop there too, and they won't risk any of us having access to fast food thin sliced pickles.",
    "The depersonalisation/derealization is increasing. Ive been mentally ill since i was 13, im now 23. The worst its ever been was in 2016/2017, and now its coming back severely. In 2017 i was diagnosed bipolar type 2, but my psychiatrists evaluation was short and he suspected schizophrenic psychosis as well. In other words schizoaffective disorder. I have a lot of trauma and cptsd symptoms. Ive painted since i was 5, and i cant describe with words all of the fantasy and creativity i have stuck inside my head. My paintings went from realism mixed with surrealism and now an increase in surrealism because of my dreams. I dont relate to most in my age and it makes me lonely and isolated. Most people dont percieve the world like i do even though i know there are some out there. But i cant find them. As im writing this im experiencing deja vu. I remember writing this before. I can see into the future but no one would believe me if i told them even though i can even prove it sometimes. I feel like i might not make it past 30 and i feel like this world is more of an illusion than we like to admit, but it doesnt matter. Im just exhausted and i dont know what to do.

    "So I’m terribly , horridly , confused about my sexuality . I’m a very very curious person by nature . I’m curious about everything . I’m a 17 year old girl in a homophobic family if that’s relevant . However , my friends and schools have always been very friendly and I’ve never been told that gay people were wrong by them . Lots of my friends have been bi , and it’s made me curious . I’ve fantasized about girls when I was 14, and these fantasies were sexual in nature. I had “crushes” on girls though idk if I should call them that . It was more being shocked at their beauty , and kinda fantasizing about them . Although if I ever had to date a girl I’d pass . Kissing a girl seems interesting but not desirable . I’d do it out of curiosity idk if I’d legitimately like them . When I was around that age , I’d wanted to be gay . Like I know how weird that sounds but I’ve had pretty bad experiences with boys . Lots of very poor male role models in my life , and my mom is pretty anti guys and tells me how awful all men are , when I was growing up . Some lesbians try to make themselves like men and even marry one right ? Could the same thing happen in reverse ? Fake attraction fueled by desperation. As of now , I find women beautiful the way flowers are , its aesthetic . My “crush” was extremely beautiful but I wouldn’t do anything with her not really . I’m so confused .",
    "\"We knew that fans were hungry for more Survivor--and so were we. We looked at this group of players and thought, 'these guys came ready to play.' And as always, we have to stay a step ahead of them. So we decided, let's put the game on fast-forward. 'You think you can take your time figuring out your strategy and looking for idols? Think again. Everybody else is talking and somebody already found the idol. And if you blink, you're voted out.' I think it's the natural evolution of the game. The last few seasons, every single vote is complex. Every single Tribal Council, the gameplay is aggressive and has consequences. So this is almost a response to that. 'You wanna play hard from the beginning? Got it. We'll make it harder.'\"",
    "I just got a request to help out the child of a person I haven't talked in 18 years. This old and close friend's wife disliked me so I was already on limited contact. But when the baby was born, I had bought a gift and kept asking when I could come meet the baby. I got the run around for weeks then finally was told I was not welcome because the wife felt, I would be judgmental about the baby. I was hurt but even then felt it said more about her than me. So, basically I never contacted them again because I was told, flat out, I was unwelcome. I consider him an ex friend. I moved away and I have not heard a peep in the intervening years since that \"you are unwelcome\" phone call. Now the child is moving to my area and they want my help for their child. The message made the request for help first then \"how you been I haven't heard from you in so long.\" I kinda don't want to help them. Am I being petty?",

    "so Im 21.  My friends are all my age or younger and we are in our 3rd year of college.  They LOVE to drink.  I have since fallen back from drinking, and that has made me realize that I have little to nothing in common with them.  I like my friends a lot, but recently I noticed they tend to ignore my invites to do things that dont involve going to booze late at night.  Even normal, fun things that most people would like to do they arent interested in and will ignore my offer.  I get liking to drink, but holy fuck it seems like its their whole life purpose to get drunk.  This is a very hard time to meet new people as well, so I kinda just feel lost.  When i talk to them sober/when were not drinking and partying our conversations suuuuuuuuck.  Its like I just met them but these are people ive known for 2+ years.  I got a job on the weekends, and so far Ive had more fun at work with my coworkers than I have with my friends.  It sucks.  Its so stupid that society expects college kids to all be wild, unhinged, borderline alcoholics.

There is no battle phase on my turn one, so after performing actions, I'd ask if he has a response and he'd say no. Ok, my board is set and I end on Bow Wow and one Prank Kid. He allows me to set backrow. I declare End Phase and he says he Nibs me at the end of my Main Phase. Can he do that, I gave him several chances within the main phase even after I completed my combo?

    "So, I just wanted to make a little post about the condition of atheists and how it's like being one in this country. First of all, it's quite disheartening to see that literally most of your country's population loathes you for your opinions and lack of belief in religion. In most social media groups of our country atheists are seen as outcasts. Most of us here are closeted atheists since there's a pretty massive chance that our families won't take this matter well. Moreover, there have been a number of brutal murders of atheists whose \"fault\" was expressing their opinions, which lead to their demise. In my opinion, freedom of speech doesn't exist here and it's despairing being in a country where you can be murdered for your opinions.",

Então tipo, eu falei pra ela, que eu tinha me comportado a semana passada e eu queria comer chocolate né, e que tipo, por mais que eu faça as coisas direito, a gente tem a necessidade de comer um doce de vez em quando. Aí ela ficou puta, começou falar que eu preferia os doces do que os amigos, e na real, pra mim os dois caminham lado a lado na vida. Se eu não como doce eu fico estressado e se eu não tenho amigos, eu me sinto sozinho, o que me deixa triste e me leva a comer doce pra maquiar a tristeza.

    "GB is what go me into my love for hot sauce. I have bought a lot of it over the years. Recently I've noticed some small changes. The red sauce no longer has Japanese chilli peppers in the ingredients. The green sauce no longer has Mojo. Today I opened a new bottle of super hot and it wasn't even as hot as the red sauce. I shook the hell out of it and tried some more. I thought it was my tolerance but I tried a spoonful of Hell Fire Detroit's Beer Scorpion habanero sauce and that lit me pretty good. Perhaps that batch or bottle just lacks heat? I know GB isn't doing a private reserve anymore. Maybe the ingredient changes were to save money. I'd honestly pay more for it if it meant keeping the OG recipes. Maybe Dexter is getting tired of running the company? Maybe he is going to sell it?

    "I regularly lose all kinds of attraction for everyone,meaning no sexual or romantic attraction to anyone,meaning no desire to date anyone and looking at content and people that usually would make me feel feel sexually attracted stops doing just that.Those phases usually last between 2 or 4 months and I'm always worried that that my attraction will never come back when I have those phrases,however up until now it always has.Im pretty sure it's not sexual dysfunction becuase that doesnt include loss of romantic attraction and it doesn't affect me in any physical way,its all psychological.Im also sure that I'm not asexual since I do feel all that attraction outside of those phases.I have tried researching my symptoms but I've never really found anything that would match,and it's just really worrying me and I dont even know if its abnormal or  just a normal part of puberty.I also marked it NSFW just to be sure.",
    "So I’ve noticed that viewer ship is all over the place depending on when I post or what I post. I just recently had posts get around 5000-54000 views. I posted again earlier in the morning and only got about 14 views. I’m wondering if when I posts effects my views as much as even the content I’m posting. I’ve also noticed people don’t really want to know about my life they would rather watch me do impulsive things that they more or less want to do but can’t go through with like dying my hair or making things that the audiences hobbies coincide with. The steps of getting viewer ship seems very difficult but also all over the place. Some people use hashtags some don’t but still get 1000’s of views. What constitutes as the perfect time, the perfect description with hashtags or even the best content for your demographic? I’ve definitely improved my viewership since the vine era but it’s all really an equation of when and what. At some point I’m really hoping to find what it is my followers or new viewers exactly want to see but until then I am still figuring it out. Has anyone noticed what seems the best time to post or even the best hashtags to use? What content seems to do better for newer users to help boost their platforms? Maybe some people could take a look at my platform and critique what I post so I can improve. tiktok: ",
    "I was talking with my therapist today about all of the judgements my JNMIL has about me.  We talked about how a lot of these judgements are at odds with one another and don’t make sense.   For example, following my DD’s birth she complained that I contribute nothing to my marriage or our finances, despite the fact that DH and I both work successful high paying jobs where I frequently earn more than him.   Then when i returned to work, she accused me of not caring about my DD’s wellbeing and being an awful mom. Despite knowing that these ideas literally don’t make sense when taken together, I still can’t help but let her get in my head.  My therapist asked why I thought that was and truly I can’t answer.  I’m curious, why do your MILs words/judgements bring you down?",
    "Reading a translation of Anabasis, I noticed that having escaped the Army of Artaxerxes, and made it through the Armenian mountain passes, the Ten Thousand encounter a reoccurring trope amongst the various Pontic peoples they encounter. There are multiple instances where the local villages flee their homes in the face of the oncoming army, and hole up in Strongholds/Citadels. From the book, it is my understanding that these are not populated settlements and are only occupied to wait out hostile forces. It also seems that they were built collectively between multiple villages rather than each village having its own small strong-point. What other sources, if any, reference this practice? Is there any evidence for these small strongholds? In the book, they are often taken by the greeks without a prolonged siege or any equipment so how sophisticated could they have been?",

    "After reading some of the reviews that trash this film I had to speak up.<br/><br/>This film is gritty and dirty. There is content which is not pleasant, swearing and violence amounts other things. What else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? Well more than that actually, it about choices and what you Choose! Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did. At no point did it ever say \"Look at this, its cool.\" For those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in Britain, not just Scotland. I being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.<br/><br/>That being said, those things do not take anything away from the film, the quality of plot and story, or the acting which is Stunning! Robert Carlise as Begbe was excellent, and Ewan MacGregor shined. Also the character Spud was worth a mention he really was quite good.<br/><br/>This film is in my Opinion a work of Genius, that represents the book accurately.",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.",
    "Why the poor box office performance?  Why the bad reviews?  Why the bad word of mouth?  I really didn't see anything horrible about this movie!  First of all, it's a character-driven story.  There's little subplots involving jealousy and philandering, but it's not handled in a soapy fashion.  I didn't feel any of the characters were one-dimensional.<br/><br/>\nOf course, Mike Myers steals the show as the homosexual club owner Steve Rubell.  I don't know the real Steve Rubell, so you be the judge whether or not his performance was accurate, but I have to say that Myers did an incredible job!  And I'm not overstating the least bit!  You watch him in this movie and you totally forget that this is the same guy who played Austin Powers.  Not to say I didn't realize Myers had talent prior to watching this film.  He has definitely proven that he has talent as a comic actor, but I didn't know he had the chops to pull off a straight, dramatic role.  Even his accent sounds real, not the least bit phony.  I'm surprised Myers didn't even get an Oscar nod.  He should've at least gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Trust me--you will be blown away by his performance in this movie!<br/><br/>The music is great.  It's always great to reminisce to the great songs from the seventies.  Mark  Christopher nicely captured the whole rebellious atmosphere of 54.  We're given a taste of the drug addiction and even the sexual promiscuity that made the place famous--there's a scene where a couple shamelessly pounds away on the balcony.  I read one person's review, saying that this movie should've been an hour longer.  I find it ironic that people watch movies that are two and a half to three hours long and complain, \"Oh, this movie dragged!  Oh, this movie needed more editing!\" Yet they watch a succintly timed film like this and complain it's too short. This may not have been the most thorough examination of the famous nightclub, but I think it got to the point.  No reason why we have to go into every tiny detail.<br/><br/>This is a serious, dramatic film but it's also very entertaining.  I actually had a smile on my face when the movie ended.  It ended on a happy note without having that forced, schmaltzy Hollywood feel.  Plus, I really like that song \"Knock on Wood\" that they played over the credits.<br/><br/>\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)",
    "The Silence of the Lambs is a timeless classic, whose more than adequate storytelling never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most entertaining but least fun films to watch all because of its disturbingly genius atmosphere.\nIt's masterfully acted, especially from Hopkins's side turning this film into a clever and unforgettable masterpiece. Even though Hopkins and Foster don't have much screentime together they still put on a show to remember. Aside from top of the line acting and the directing the script from Ted Tally's (based on the novel by Thomas Harris) is career-defining. From thriller to psychological horror, this movie handles the tone and atmosphere perfectly while switching between the two. In terms of being a psychological horror movie, it does it perfecting as it wraps itself around the viewers' head and proves that gore and blood aren't needed to scare an audience. Surprisingly (and deservedly) this film swooped all five major Oscar categories (Best actor, actress, director, screenplay and picture) even though it was released in February, a whole year before the academy awards.<br/><br/>The Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable feat in film making and you be seen by everyone, a film lover or not. Shocking and suspenseful it is a thrill to behold.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10",
    "The best film in the era of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Supremely well acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize.

Realmete with this film you can compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly.",
    "I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.<br/><br/>\nIt is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. <br/><br/>As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see \"Hart's War\" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).<br/><br/>All in all, \"The Great Escape\" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",
    "Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel \"Hearts of darkness\" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.<br/><br/>The film has a simple premise, US Army Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into Cambodia through a river, to assassinate a renegade, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. It's an accessible premise, allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers, and yet this film is anything but shallow. It's a journey into madness and hysteria, an observation into the darkness of humanity. I could write a book analyzing this film, there's just so much to talk about. My interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find Kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character's inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie, dehumanization. The journey through the river is also reminiscent of Dante's perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. There are three major stops before Kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought, as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.<br/><br/>The first stop is with lieutenant Kilgore. That stop shows that Kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. Their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can't comprehend the consequences the war will bring. In one scene of the movie, the \"heroic\" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies, Captain Kilgore uses Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures Valkyries, he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. At this stage, although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy, they still understand the innocent.<br/><br/>The second stop is the USO show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. At this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself, becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. The soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. Now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.\nThe last stop before Kurtz is the Do-long Bridge and it's at this point that a soldier has gone too far, he's experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can't return to a normal state of mind.<br/><br/>The final stop on the journey is Kurtz, at this point only Willard and Kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness, the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. Kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. Bypassing the madness stage he's able to see the world for what it truly is, filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. Willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. He kills Kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. In the end Willard has a choice, succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken Kurtz's place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon, he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving Lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe, he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. Both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn't, they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.<br/><br/>The film presents this study of the human psyche through Carmine Coppola's eerie score, hypnotic images, and some haunting scenes, essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. It's here where Coppola succeeds the most. His ability to create a living \"hell\" is so amazing, and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. It provides a commentary on war and religion, making the subtext even vaster. The film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film's runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat, and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner, conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer's breath away. Coppola's direction transcends itself, the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows, most notable during Col. Kurtz's first appearance. The troubled production obviously didn't hurt the film at all, and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. Apocalypse Now is beautifully haunting, utterly hellish, terrifyingly intelligent, and magnificently wrought, it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war, but also its meaningfulness and beauty. Not only is this one of the best films ever made, it's a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. It is Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. Rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon, immortal for its contribution to cinema, and a truly unforgettable experience, Apocalypse Now is cinema at its most complete, crystalline and pure.",
    "After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions, ridiculous CG-assisted stunts and mindless action, I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better. <br/><br/>The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle. <br/><br/>De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots, but all are carefully tied into the through-line of the story to match the main character's progression. <br/><br/>The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story, The Bay of Pigs debacle, and traces the steps that lead to it, one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character, Edward Wilson, barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did (the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wire-rimmed or horn-rimmed glasses), but it didn't ruin the film for me. <br/><br/>Overall though, definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand, rather than forget.",
    "Well I guess it's official, I'm eating my words as we speak. Yeah, I'm the guy who doesn't like sequels and yet here I am giving positive ratings to Star Trek Into Darkness and now The Hangover Part III. It's scary to think of what I might do next. If the new Fast and the Furious movie impresses me, I guess I'll just skip reviewing it and go straight into denial. But seriously folks, I went into the new Hangover with really low expectations. We're talking bottom feeder if you know what I mean. So from now on I think that's the key. I'm going to take this approach with every film I see. That way I'll stroll out of the theater as a movie critic that raves about everything and comes off as not so darn grumpy. Whoa, forget what I just said. I was merely kidding people!<br/><br/>Anyway, here's what occurs in part III. At the very beginning, we find mentally unstable \"wolfpack\" member Alan (Zach Galifianakis getting the most exposure he's had in any of the Hangover films) buying a giraffe, putting it in the back of his truck, and killing it on the freeway (I'm thinking you know how it happened). Upon doing this, he irritates his family and draws concern from the other \"wolfpack\" members (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha). Everyone but Alan, stages an intervention on his behalf to get him to a treatment center somewhere in Arizona. He'll agree to go if his three buds will drive him there. As the four of them set out on a moderately short road trip, their car is rammed off the road, they are dragged out of it (held at gunpoint mind you), and one of the crew (Bartha of course) is taken hostage. This sets off a chain of events which leads everybody to venture back to good old Sin City.<br/><br/>Well let's get down to it. Right off the bat I want to let you know why I liked The Hangover Part III. I enjoyed it for the exact reason that some critics panned it. This flick doesn't try to be like the other two in the trilogy. In fact, it feels like a totally different animal all together. Yes there is a dash of the funny (something part I did effortlessly and part II attempted miserably), but there's also a hint of darkness that comes close to turning everything into a sort of black comedy with shards of mild violence. For me, this is an effective way to wrap things up (unless there is a part IV of course). You can tell that the director (Todd Phillips) wanted to avoid copping out and injected part III with a little more juice (this is the other reason I liked it and most critics didn't. They think Phillips went way over the top or felt he had to prove something). He did the film justice by avoiding the same tired plot line (everyone gets smashed and wakes up not knowing what the heck just happened) while making an effort to tie together loose ends from the other two movies (by way of flashbacks). This is done to effect in the first 15 minutes and it sets everything in motion.<br/><br/>The actors then promptly assume their personalities from the first two installments. Doug Billings who's never around for the debauchery, plays the happily married nice guy. Alan, plays the screw loose, borderline mental patient who nonchalantly goes about his business. Phil, is the smug, unhappily married school teacher who is calm under pressure, and Stu is the manic anxiety ridden dentist who thinks all hope is gone. Together they fit their roles like comfortable old shoes. Overall their performances are manically unhinged. You get what's required of them coupled with a fresher more potently nasty script this time around (part II's had lazy written all over it).<br/><br/>As far as supporting work goes, I thought John Goodman (gangster Marshall) was a nice little addition to the Hangover family (he riffs off his Big Lebowski character but just not quite as intense). I also like the addition of a love interest for Alan (someone besides man crush Phil) in Melissa McCarthy. She seems to make a cameo in everything these days and certainly is a hoot as a pawn shop owner who candidly berates her wheelchair confined mother.<br/><br/>The only setback for this Hangover is the blatant deviation from the focus of the four stars of the movie (the infamous \"wolfpack\"). This exercise is bent on giving two supporting characters their own vehicle (Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Galifianakis). True these guys are funny and steal many a scene, but the other members of the cast don't get a lot of room to breathe. They get kind of pushed to the side and become sort of frowned upon (Bradley Cooper recently got nominated for an Oscar, give him some props for gosh sakes). And what's with always having Justin Bartha's character not present with the other members of the \"pack\" when the madness of their misadventures is going down. It seems predetermined and silly. What, is he not good enough an actor to occupy some precious screen time with his buddies (Bartha was in the colossal flop Gigli (2003) so maybe that's it, who knows).<br/><br/>When it all comes down to it, I found myself at ease with the way part III whisked by. It's darker than the first one, funnier than the second one, and more daring than both of them. I laughed, I winced, and felt confident in recommending this hot mess of a movie. It's a sequel all right, but it tries really hard not to be one. I admire that. With nothing to lose, you should go check out The Hangover part III. It's a solid time killer and a required \"hair of the dog\" if you will.",
    "As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.<br/><br/>However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.<br/><br/>For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).<br/><br/>The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.<br/><br/>What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.",
    "I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as \"one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles\" and \"one of the classics of the 70's\". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a \"crazy house\" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.<br/><br/>What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.<br/><br/>-10/10",
    "I am an engineer working offshore in North Sea. I have seen the movie this evening in UK. Is really a good movie, congratulations to all involved you done a great job showing a little bit of ''life in offshore rig''. Looks like in this movie is BP fault but in real world at the rig site everyone has the right to STOP THE JOB if something is wrong or something is going on against the procedures. I have work before in BP rigs in North Sea and I stop the job when I wasn't happy with what is going on I had all the support from the Service Company that I am working for and also BP company understood my concerns. If you are a engineer, roughneck, derrick-man or whatever you are at Rig Site if you think that something is going wrong and against the procedures STOP THE JOB. I do it and I will do again better to lose my job than to see people dying.(Thanks for reading my review)",
    "Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.<br/><br/>Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.<br/><br/>Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.<br/><br/>I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.<br/><br/>I hope my talk helps.",
    "My name is Cecilia and being from Manila this film is very personal to me because my grandfather sacrificed his life during WWII. According to eyewitness accounts, he was tied to a post, doused with kerosene and set on fire. I am watching this film to somehow pay tribute to him and those who selflessly gave up their lives to ensure a free and humane future for all of us. I felt though that the film underestimated what we Filipinos really went through during the war. It would have been just to include the other atrocities perpetuated by the Japanese: babies thrown in the air and caught with bayonets, women brutally raped and breasts carved out, or the massacre of approximately 100,000 unarmed and innocent civilians during the battle for the liberation of Manila on the first days of February 1945. Nevertheless, I am grateful for director John Dahl for shedding light on a chapter in our history that many people hardly know about , specially the present generation, The Bataan Death March.",
    "After watching this movie I can say that no it is not as good as the original but that does mean that it is a bad movie. What I was really excited to see in this movie from the trailers was the scares and the demon nun Valak. The movie does not disappoint and can't wait to see the next entry in the conjuring series!",
    "`The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped, bound and gagged, into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most, if not all, of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet, Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving indifference, to be a criminal-type with a heart of gold, and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline, which exists merely as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed, well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright, sparkling sheen.   In fact, Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham, who makes for a very `cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",
    "Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!",
    "8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.<br/><br/>The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.<br/><br/>The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the \"Free World,\" are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.<br/><br/>Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.<br/><br/>All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.",
    "Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney.  That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist.  He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br/><br/>But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.  Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself.  Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi!  Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.",
    "Dawn of the Dead<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.<br/><br/>And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>Grade: A-",
    "This film will generate anger because it throws a \"deadpan\" brick directly towards cultural dysfunction and mass delusion. \"War Machine,\" and Brad Pitt, even exceeded the deadpan message of \"Being There\" a film from a less cynical time in history but still relevant to this day. <br/><br/>\"War Machine\" does a great job illustrating how disconnected the every-man has become in relation to reality. We live in a time where facts are now selectively chosen to support forgone perspectives rather than being absolute, universal, and irrefutable. <br/><br/>We live in a time where personage, perceptions, and public relations matter more than overview, objectives, conclusions, and endpoints. Reality has been set adrift. <br/><br/>It was a brave thing to produce this film because it speaks to a very narrow audience. Most people won't be entertained by the communication mechanism (deadpan) nor will the understand the message. Few people will be open to perspectives other than those which are preconceived. Some people are not aware and thus cannot acknowledge the wounds and damage that political lies have done to the American process and psyche. <br/><br/>To conclude our failed state of affairs, the affairs of a failed nation state (our nation state) I am not with him because he is certainly not with me no matter how much he tells me otherwise. The cohesion of leadership, truth, and the American way has left the building.<br/><br/>It is more of a shame that people won't understand this film, or won't want to. And that is how far we have fallen. Perhaps Rome fell the same way on the sword and misadventure of its own lies and delusion.",
    "\"The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived, without wealth, without property, without official title or office.  Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies, nor the ruler of vast lands.  He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift.  Yet men, governments, dignitaries from all over the world, have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth, who led his country to freedom.\"<br/><br/>This quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film \"Gandhi\".  Richard Attenborough directed this massive epic about the man that freed India. The film opens with Gandhi's assassination.  The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi's funeral on January 31st, 1981, the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral.  It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation. This film was made before CGI (computer generated images), so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed.<br/><br/>\nMahatma Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art.  This film has made and will make millions of people aware of the little brown man that took on the British Empire and won.  \"Gandhi\" serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history.<br/><br/>\nBen Kingsley played Gandhi.  He was the perfect for the role.  He resembled the real Gandhi.  He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man. He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.   He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part. And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the \"big-time actor\" persona did not get in the way of viewing the film.  He did win both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor, for this role, which I agree he deserved.  He became Gandhi.<br/><br/>The cinematography was outstanding.  Attenborough filmed \"Gandhi\" on location in India.  The scenes of India are spectacular, and India is very much another character in the film.  This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi.  Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta.  It is suggested by Kingsley, on the DVD, that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming.  They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman.  Undeterred by their negative thinking, he persevered to enlist thousands of Indians to help make this film.  Every crowd scene, he used real Indians from the area. Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for everyone.  It should be required viewing in high schools, as part of History class.  The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant.  It is also a beautiful work of art.  This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood (see \"Pearl Harbor\" for that). Of course, it would have been hard to screw up a movie about such a great man. 10/10",
    "I walked into the movie theater expecting to see Adam Sandler make a complete buffoon of himself. However, when I came out I was impressed. There was a depth to this movie I did not see coming, and it took me completely off guard. \"Click\" proved to be a powerful, emotional, and humorous piece of work. There was a certain philosophical message in this movie, in which I think, we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work-aholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie, and in \"Click\" he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh. Definitely a 10/10 in my book.",
    "It's hard to say if is an improvement or not on the original, but it's certainly a good continuation of the story this time more focused on Alex's origin and life.

    "There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.<br/><br/>The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.<br/><br/>You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless. <br/><br/>The King's Speech boasts an exceptional cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.<br/><br/>The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year.",
    "I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.<br/><br/>10/10 Highly Recommended",
    "I've almost always loved Crowe's style of storytelling and never tire of rewatching 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry McGuire' (which I consider his best). Even though his more recent 'Elizabethtown' didn't match up the standards of those two films, that too had its wonderful moments (and it was better than 'Vanilla Sky', Crowe shouldn't have attempted remakes). Like most of his films, 'Jerry McGuire' has soul. Crowe's eloquent screenplay is rich in humour, drama and lots of energy. It features some of the finest dialogues and one-liners like 'You had me at hello', 'Don't cry at the beginning of a date, cry at the end like I do'... and the actors deliver them marvelously. Another fascinating aspect is the brilliant characters. Each and every one of them, no matter how long the screen time, has something that contributes. Thus, next to an engaging drama and a magnificent comedy it is a fine character study.<br/><br/>'Jerry McGuire' may also be one of Cruise's career best movies. I'm surprised to hear that the part was originally written for Tom Hanks. Hanks is a fine actor but I can't imagine him as McGuire as I doubt whether he has the right combination of energy and pathos that are required to be McGuire. I can't imagine anyone but Tom who fits the part. The same can be said of Renee Zellweger and Cuba Godding Jr as I don't see how a Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz or Mira Sorvino and a Jamie Foxx (all good actresses) could respectively bring out the sweetness, vulnerability and charisma of Dorothy Boyd or the energy, humour, liveliness, enthusiasm and devotion (towards family) of Rod Tidwell. One wonders why Zellweger was overlooked as her presence too is crucial to the film.<br/><br/>In addition, the film has a splendid supporting cast that include a sublime and laugh-out-loud Bonnie Hunt, a bitchy gorgeous Kelly Preston, a sprightly Regina King and an unforgettably lovable Jonathan Lipnicki (one of the few child actors who's cute but not in the way that gets on your nerves)'. Child actors are very hard to direct but Lipnicki's performance comes across as very natural and he acts like a real child instead of those irritating oh-look-I'm-so-cute child models.<br/><br/>The soundtrack too deserves mention as it features some amazing numbers. One of the so many memorable scenes is when McGuire is driving in his car and he listens to the radio, switching channels and singing along. Then there's also the incredibly romantic 'Secret Garden' by Bruce Springsteen among other great familiar tracks by the Beatles, Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain etc. On the more technical side, the wild and smooth cinematography, slick editing and effective sound are superbly put together. The visuals are very impressive.<br/><br/>The last time I had watched 'Jerry McGuire' was about 10 years ago and I vividly remember saying 'wow!' when the end credits started to roll that my sibling wondered what the hell was going on. I feel the same about it after having rewatched it recently. Well, actually I like it more because I noticed more things that I overlooked before and understand and like the characters more. McGuire's transformation from the money-obsessed agent to the caring agent and then to the caring human being (in the form of a father and a husband), a change that wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the caring people in his life, is one remarkable story.",
    "This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",
    "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. <br/><br/>This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. <br/><br/>The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. <br/><br/>The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. <br/><br/>I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.",
    "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.<br/><br/>But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.<br/><br/>I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date.",
    "When I see films like this, it really underlines the programmed ignorance of most Americans, and just how effective the government and the media are at shaping a false narrative. Al Qaeda was never an existential threat to America, and the Taliban was an internecine problem only to local Afghans and different Islamic sects. The conflict and motivation set up in this film is just ludicrous and phony. I am retired US Army, I still have contacts in the service who know the truth about Afghanistan. This film is a sham.",
    "Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for \"Airplane\", \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\", and the \"Naked Gun\" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody! <br/><br/>I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the \"Hotel Gay Schluffen\", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.<br/><br/>I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him afterwards!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If \"Top Secret!\" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means \"She whose bosoms defy gravity\"?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)<br/><br/>The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.<br/><br/>It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, but there's no doubt about it, \"Top Secret!\" IS one of the great comedies of our time.",
    "Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. \"When you re-write a script it gets better and better\" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like \"Nick of Time\" \"The Astronaut's Wife\" and \"Secret Window\" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a \"safe\", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!",
    "Heartbreaking yet captivating, Changeling's story was fascinating all the way through, even if the first half was a little slow. It certainly was a compelling story, shot beautifully, and written well. Angelina Jolie gave a mesmerizing performance as grief stricken Christine Collins, as well as the many young actors in the film. It's certainly worth the time.",
    "In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends because he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it was free, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.",
    "For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the characters in the movie. Sorry for those who's lives were so well protected that they've never been exposed to the likes of us but, that's how we talk and act. It's a type-A environment and we use it to protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.<br/><br/>I am well versed on the facts as provided by the MSM however, as someone in the biz I also know that the fly in the ointment are the facts.<br/><br/>1. The firing of mortars is an art and the mortar launcher has to be anchored to the ground or every mortar will land off target. The mortars landing on the CIA compound are dead accurate and also require spotters to assist with any corrections.<br/><br/>2. Aviano AB, Italy is about 2-hours away. Had they been launched, even if only to do a low fly-by, would have driven off the attackers; just like I used them in Iraq in Mosul, Tikrit, and Baghdad. I don't know why the Commander of the 555 (Triple Nickel) didn't launch. It's one of the big questions that remain unanswered by the media or the movie.<br/><br/>3. Hillary's statement that, \"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?\" was a red herring. Because it was neither. As later testimony bore out, it was a planned, coordinated, terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11.<br/><br/>4. All UAS aircraft are armed.

    "In the midst of the many wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick, it is strange to note how rarely people mention \"Barry Lyndon\".<br/><br/>The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.<br/><br/>Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in \"Barry Lyndon\" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.<br/><br/>The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.<br/><br/>\"Barry Lyndon is\", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them! KimotoCat",
    "It is too unbelievable and too lame. It is unfunny and like a cartoon that is on film.\nExaggeration is OK when it is interesting not when it is a spoof that takes itself seriously.",
    "When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.<br/><br/>Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots. <br/><br/>I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish \"whodunit\" as well. <br/><br/>Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as \"Del Spooner\", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in \"Enemy of the State\" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, \"Independence Day\" and \"Men in Black\". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.<br/><br/>A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. <br/><br/>The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a \"good guy\" or not. <br/><br/>This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.<br/><br/>Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the \"camera moving with moving object\" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment. <br/><br/>In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. <br/><br/>Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that \"I, Robot\" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.<br/><br/>Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie, any movie that gives you fun, drama, action, mystery, and makes you think is a great movie. Thank goodness I, Robot is all of the above.",
    "Being German I'm not really into the Hooligan way of life. I'm just fond of the Brit way of making films and this one is just brilliant. Of course you can argue about whether the director Nick Love is showing the life of some football thugs too positive and without the \"never do this, kids\" attitude, but...this is just a great piece of film. It has terrific acting (especially Frank Harper does a great job), splendid camera and editing and a more than suiting soundtrack. Watched it with some pals and it was just great fun. The scene where Rod tells his girlfriend's parents about his inner thoughts is a highlight. So if you're able to shut out all thoughts of moral and you're just interested in 90 minutes of quality film-making of today...watch this. It's definitely all worth it!",
    "A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Helen Mirren works a miracle with her characterization. When the Queen is forced by circumstances to address her people and mourn in public Diana's death, Helen Mirren doesn't forget that her character is a seasoned public speaker but not an actress. When she delivers her speech to her subjects, the real strength is in her commitment to her duty and not the meaning of her words. It is a chilling, masterful acting stroke. Stephen Frears uses the brilliantly structured script to reveal something that's always being in front of our eyes but we've never seen. The privacy of the most public people in the world. Michael Sheen is terrific as Blair and every piece of casting is truly inspired but it's Helen Mirren's film, oh yeah, one hundred per cent.",
    "Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.<br/><br/>The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous \"blondes\"), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.<br/><br/>\"To reveal more,\" as Leonard Maltin wrote, \"would be unthinkable.\"<br/><br/>While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!<br/><br/>One of the all-time greats. They definitely don't make them like this anymore.",
    "What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!<br/><br/>BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.<br/><br/>Go see this movie!",
    "We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum.",
    "This of course is not a great movie but I just have to give it a 10/10. I have never laughed more in my life. Even the jokes that aren't funny are funny. This film's comedic build up is about the best you will ever see. It doesn't even matter what the punch line is, its how they get to it thats hilarious.<br/><br/>Now this cast was perfect. Anytime you have Randy Quaid in a film you just know the film is going to make you life just by looking at him. Kingpin couldn't have shown this any better as he plays an Amish man who just happens to be amazingly talented at bowling. Woody Harrelson plays a has-been ex-professional bowler who makes a comeback with managing through Randy Quaid. Together they go on a ride across the country making money left and right. Along the journey they are great supporting comedic performances given by Bill Murray and Vanessa Angel who certainly makes the look of the film more appealing.<br/><br/>The Farrelly brothers in my opinion give their best direction they've yet to have. Yet it is the writers who so perfectly set up one joke after another. It seems as if the script is so sharp that their are jokes within jokes. The Farrelly brother handle this material so well by virtual unknowns.<br/><br/>As I have said before this is not a great film but I would highly recommend this if your in the mood of watching something spontaneous. It may not be the most technically sound movie ever made or the deepest but I have never laughed so much in life and that in it self is what comedies are about.",
    "Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with Bill Murray losing his job, girlfriend, and apartment, all in the same day. He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups, exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, \"I think your ready for the Special Olympics!\" Harold also shines in a bit-part in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand, \"You speak some English?\" The student answers back \"SOB and $hit\" and the whole class than repeats it.<br/><br/>The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy joins the fun as likable, lovable \"Ox.\" There are the typical sex gags, simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.<br/><br/>After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine, having silly one-lines like, \"Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do.\" rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe, the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.",
    "I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\".",
    "Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****<br/><br/>What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.<br/><br/>In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. <br/><br/>Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. <br/><br/>Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. <br/><br/>We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. <br/><br/>These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. <br/><br/>Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. <br/><br/>Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>4/4",
    "Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.<br/><br/>Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.<br/><br/>Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.<br/><br/>The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!<br/><br/>This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.<br/><br/>PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive.",
    "The Auteurist Perspective - The most unorthodox way of viewing this picture is as a kind of formalist exercise. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has talked about his desire to make a film tailored exactly to the format of a Hollywood action movie, even going so far as to count the number of cuts and camera set-ups in the blockbusters he watched for research. Everything in the movie may be taking place within quotation marks, as in the melodramas of Douglas Sirk or, more obliquely, Gus van Sant's 'Psycho'. The film wants to be both an archetypal big sci-fi action movie whilst simultaneously a pastiche of the form. The gorgeously overblown shot of Ripley and Call standing amid the clouds at the film's close certainly suggests a playful tweaking of blockbuster bombast. However, the 'Alien' series may not be the most appropriate place for this experiment; the series is far more defined by spaces and silences than by frenetic action of the Bruckheimer variety. Even James Cameron's 'Aliens' is surprisingly slow in its build-up; by contrast, Resurrection's relentless pace becomes oddly monotonous and the film loses the distinctive texture Jeunet brings to it.<br/><br/>The Whedonite Perspective - The problems with the script are mostly additions or changes to Joss Whedon's original (which is available online). Whedon rightly made Ripley's resurrection the backbone for the story, finding new things to do with a character many believed had reached the end of her life, both literally and creatively. He also carefully fleshed out the supporting characters just enough to keep them interesting. There are small problems even in his original script - Purviss is sidelined when his predicament demands imaginative exploration, and the narrative is more linear than you'd expect from this writer. But it's the feeble alterations that damage the film - reducing characters like Hillard (in particular) to cyphers, changing the ending so the audience never gets to see earth (the only place, as Whedon instinctively understood, that the climax could possibly take place), and removing a lot of the texture of the setting, like the marijuana fields. 'I'm a stranger here myself' should have been one of the great closing lines in movie history, up there with 'Tomorrow is another day' and 'Shut up and deal', but the dialogue (Whedon's great strength) is mangled by a director working in his second language, and who seems to be paying more attention to the lighting anyway.<br/><br/>The Cynical Perspective - The 'Alien' series is, by this point, a cash cow that everyone involved wants to milk until it bleeds. 'Alien3' ended Ripley's story with an unflinching finality that 'Resurrection' can only cheapen, no matter how good it is. The hiring of a cult french director is a sop to the critics who lionise Scott and Fincher's contributions - and whilst prior instalments were filmed in England, this production was mounted in LA, for the convenience of everyone involved. It wouldn't do to make too much of an effort on what is, after all, the latest sausage on the string. The suits' only concern is the opening weekend; hence Winona, shoehorned in just in case Sigourney's box office draw is waning.<br/><br/>The Aesthetic Perspective - John Frizzell's score is the fourth classic in a row for the series; both lushly romantic and queasily menacing, it gives the film its own distinctive flavour. The production design is bold and distinctive, with perhaps a hint of playful parody (the sickly green light, the mad scientist outfits, the giant glass jars in the lab); the film looks like a comic strip version of its predecessors. Some of the direction is highly effective - the underwater sequence is devastatingly beautiful. The problem is the slightly over-ripe grotesquerie Jeunet brings out in the material, particularly in the way the cast is shot (Dominique Pinon looks like a malevolent garden gnome, Dan Hedaya resembles a sweaty gendarme). It sits uneasily with the straightforward disaster movie plot. The biggest miscalculation on the production front, however, is the Newborn. The thinking behind it - to give it an expressive face and thus complicate Ripley's (and our) emotional response to it - is sound enough, but it doesn't really come off in the finished creature, which looks like moldy old tissues clinging to a pipe-cleaner frame. Whedon's original conception of a white, red-veined alien of the traditional design might have worked more effectively, although even that might not have survived the aesthetic indignity of its impossible demise, getting sucked into space as a string of alien linguine.",
    "I've been slowly making my way through Guillermo del Toro's catalogue of movies and this is my first time watching Hell Boy. If you're a Del Toro fan, then this one won't disappoint. He's such a superior director - he adds artistry to this action film through his use of shot making, pacing and colour. At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself.",
    "George : Hey guys, remember that movie we all did a few years back called Ocean's Eleven?<br/><br/>Brad : Course we do, we had such a great time.<br/><br/>Julia : And let's not forget we made stacks of money on it. It was a hit!<br/><br/>George : Well here's an idea.Let's make a sequel!<br/><br/>Matt : Fantastic idea! I mean the first one had all of us in it but most of all it was directed, had cool music, had lots of us in it and had a great script.<br/><br/>Brad : The script? Oh yeah, the script, whatever.<br/><br/>Julia : Let's do it. Everyone will love seeing us mugging it up on the screen. Steven Soderbergh's a friend of mine so he'll love directing us again.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, he'll do it. He won't have to work too hard though because it's got us in it. In fact he can just stuff around and experiment with all sorts of stupid camera angles.<br/><br/>Matt : Won't that just confuse the audience and make them dizzy?<br/><br/>George : Stuff that! Just so long as everyone can make out it's us up there on the screen they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : And the music??<br/><br/>Brad : Pfft! Music? No one goes to the movies for music. They want to see stars. Like us! Let's just have any old stupid music for this one.<br/><br/>Matt : That's fine. What about the script?<br/><br/>Brad : What is it with you and the script? Hey here's an idea. Julia, you're so famous and wonderful<br/><br/>Julia : So are you Brad.<br/><br/>Brad : Thanks Julia. What I was saying was how about we have an entire sequence where your character pretends to be you! Everyone knows you're fantastic so they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great idea Brad. How do we fit that into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Julia! Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK. How about we get someone else as famous and wonderful as us to join in the cast? The audience will love that.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, let's get Bruce Willis in a pointless uncredited cameo. He's never been too fussy about what movies he's made before. He's bound to say yes.<br/><br/>Matt : How do we fit him into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Bruce Willis. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK, who else?<br/><br/>Brad : I'm way ahead of you here, Julia. I've got a famous wife so let's get someone who is famous and wonderful, with a famous husband and who they audience will love if they see her and I having a romantic scene.<br/><br/>All : Catherine Zeta Jones!<br/><br/>George : I'll call her and see. <br/><br/>(Ring Ring)<br/><br/>Catherine : Hello. George : Hi Catherine, George Clooney here. You might remember working with me in Intolerable Crueltythe audience loved it!<br/><br/>Catherine : Hi George. What's up?<br/><br/>George : We're making a sequel to Ocean's Eleven. It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt in it. How'd you like to be in it too?<br/><br/>Catherine : Yeah sure. What's it about?<br/><br/>George : Who cares?? It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt and you in it!!<br/><br/>Catherine : OK. But how about we film it in Europe? The audience will love that!<br/><br/>George : It's a deal. See ya.<br/><br/>Catherine : Bye<br/><br/>Julia : So how'd it go?<br/><br/>George : She's in AND she had a great idea. She reckons we could film it somewhere in Europe.<br/><br/>Brad : Fantastic!<br/><br/>Matt : So how does that fit into the script?<br/><br/>Julia : Who cares about the script!! It's got us in it! And anyone who liked Ocean's Eleven will get sucked into seeing it and by then it's too late for them to worry about the script because they've already paid their money.<br/><br/>George : And besides they'll love it because it's got me and Julia and Matt and Brad AND Catherine in it AND it will be filmed in Europe. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great. Let's do it!!<br/><br/>you get the idea.",
    "I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original – just: Wow!<br/><br/>It's clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the 'office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) – this movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for film geeks like me.

    "So once again, after the debacle of Prometheus, Ridley Scott has proved himself simultaneously a master of visuals and yet utterly incompetent when it comes to creating a believable Alien story.<br/><br/>The single biggest problem I had with Prometheus was the collection of imbeciles and weirdos that made up the crew, and one might have hoped that Mr Scott would have realised that himself and made amends this time round. Errr.... no, sadly not. Once again we're treated to a crew of simpletons who make THE MOST pathetic and unbelievable decisions possible. Are we really supposed to believe that a crew would just ditch it's primary mission (that we're told had been over 10 years in the planning to ensure their destination was safe, etc) just because they happened to stumble on a new planet purely by chance? Just plain ludicrous. And that's just the start. A few more examples :<br/><br/><ul><li>Assuming we suspend our disbelief and accept the whole \"let's risk all the colonists and everything we have planned for decades for to land on this new unknown planet instead\" premise, why do these alleged scientists once again TOTALLY disregard the need for any protective clothing? So no breathing equipment, nothing at all to protect them from any alien pathogens. Good thinking!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Faced with a choice of sending either an android, or pretty much the entire human crew with no protective gear, to investigate an alien world, who should go? Yeah that's right, send all the unprotected humans!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Choice of landing right near the source of the unknown signal, or land several miles away and in a foot of water despite there being solid and flat ground a few feet away? Yep, it's wet feet and a huge hike all round folks!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Little alien pods on this alien world puffing their alien spores into the air? Sure, just get your nose in there and have a good sniff. I'm sure it'll be fine!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crewmen get infected by said spores? Don't worry about any quarantine procedures, just carry them back to the ship while getting covered in their vomited-up blood.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alien organism just burst out of said infected crewman? Just open up the locked door and try to shoot it, but be careful you don't miss at point blank range and then slip up on the blood.... twice. (When that happened, people actually laughed in the cinema. I was half expecting a comedy sound effect the second time!)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tens of thousands of dead bodies, and an enormous dead city solely inhabited by David the android from the Prometheus mission, that the planetary scan managed to NOT pick up from orbit when determining the planet to be \"safe\"? No need to ask David what happened, just accept that it's all fine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dark basements to go into all on your own? Do it! Nothing bad will happen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Huge alien eggs opening in front of you? Just have a good look inside. What could possibly go wrong?!</li></ul><br/><br/>The list of stupid decisions just goes on and on AND ON!<br/><br/>While visually the film is generally excellent, the all-CGI-Alien was a huge let-down. Personally I found it considerably less convincing than the practical effects used in Alien and Aliens, which is unforgivable considering the creature is what these films are all about!<br/><br/>Additionally the crew, apart from being imbeciles (as is usual under Mr Scott's direction these days), are also completely forgettable. I saw this movie last night and I can't remember a single character's name today. The one exception is David/Walter, and once again Fassbender does a great job. (Perhaps that's why there's two of them - to make up for a lack of any other decent characters).<br/><br/>The other problem narrative-wise is that both Prometheus and Covenant have actually served to make the Alien universe much SMALLER in my opinion. In the original Alien and Aliens, the creature was just an unknown organism from the far reaches of the universe, and all the more scary because of it. (The same went for the Space Jockey for that matter). But these new movies have tried to tie it all back to humanity in some way - i.e. the Engineers (who are also the Space Jockeys) created both humanity and the black oil virus, and then the Xenomorph was apparently created by David (who was in turn created by man) somehow doing some genetic tinkering with the black oil and human DNA, while living in a cave and playing with his flute. Far from expanding the Alien universe, both these prequels have actually shrunk it by making man the centre of everything, while at the same time managing to sanitise and neuter one of the greatest movie creatures of all time. So what Ridley Scott is saying is that the entire Alien series and the iconic Xenomorph itself was just created by a deranged android with God/daddy issues. How very pathetic and disappointing. I personally hate it when movies try to explain everything to the millionth degree because it invariably ends up as a massive anticlimax. What was wrong with the Xenomorph just being some hideous unknown life-form from the far reaches of space???<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but there's a word limit here.<br/><br/>Lastly, the end is just pretty feeble and anticlimactic. The CG- Alien just kind of gets killed and that's it. And the *ahem* \"twist\" with David/Walter could be seen from a mile away, although David wouldn't have had anywhere near enough time to cut his own arm off and change his clothes and hairstyle.<br/><br/>Please PLEASE Mr Scott, stand aside and let Neill Blomkamp have his shot at an Aliens sequel.<br/><br/>A generous 2 Stars. One for the visuals that are once again gorgeous, and one for a great effort from Fassbender.",
    "Spectre was a classy action movie....making the expected James Bond signatures always look new. loved the suave and class of our favourite British spy. Daniel Craig just re-immersed us in giving us another classic to relish for years.",
    "I'll be honest, I don't think any of the reviewers that have given this movie 10 stars have seen any episodes of the show pre-2000.<br/><br/>I went into the movie thinking it would probably be decent. I figured it would probably be in the style of the newer episodes but with better overall material. That's pretty much how it turned out. Anyone who says it was a return to the older *better* Simpsons is kidding themselves.<br/><br/>The Simpsons greatness was based, in my opinion, on two things: characters that we imagine existing in our society (think the comic book guy, Moe, Flanders) and simply hilarious and very quotable lines. This formula has since been replaced by humor that is situationally based, and quite frankly, just not very funny.<br/><br/>I saw this movie yesterday afternoon, and I can hardly think of one line that had me cracking up. There were some funny moments, yes, but nothing comparable to the brilliant one-liners from the show's glory years.",
    "... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.<br/><br/>So, let's count off:<br/><br/>Cloverfield stops just short of carving 'all the characters in this movie die!' into your forehead in the first 40 seconds of the movie, making it impossible to feel any sort of emotional attachment to them? Check.<br/><br/>Magically-appearing army which arrives roughly TEN MINUTES into the monster attack despite the fact that one of the main bridges into Manhattan was destroyed not thirty-seconds earlier? Check.<br/><br/>Monster can't be hurt by weapons? Check. This is forgivable, it's a trope of all giant monster movies. Most make some attempt to explain it... in Cloverfield, they just assume you'll go: \"Oh, of course that doesn't work. It IS a giant monster, after all.\"<br/><br/>Monster drops off little baby monsters (in this case, parasites) that only serve to pad the movie and give the filmmakers an excuse to film someone (literally) exploding off-camera with no explanation as to WHY said character exploded because of the bite of a little monster? Check.<br/><br/>Exiting the subway into a conveniently-placed Army hospital? Check.<br/><br/>Baby monster bite that, while severe, doesn't slow down any of the caste UNTIL the poorly telegraphed \"I feel a little dizzy\" followed by the above-referenced character explosion? Check.<br/><br/>Skyscraper improbably leaning against another skyscraper without either of them collapsing? Check.<br/><br/>Girl survives roughly six hours with a rebar spike through her shoulder without bleeding to death... OK, this one's plausible. People have survived weirder, and the rebar MIGHT have kept her from bleeding to death.<br/><br/>Girl is capable of running not once, but twice, roughly ten minutes after being REMOVED from said rebar? Without being slowed down because of blood-loss, pain, nausea, or any other reason? Check.<br/><br/>Monster pulls a 'Dragonball Z' and gets back up despite lots of bombs and a huge cloud of smoke? Check.<br/><br/>Helicopter crashes in central park, and only the three main characters survive? Check.<br/><br/>Guy and his girl fiend wind up together at the end, complete with useless and weepy Blair Witch \"I'm scared, why is this happening to me?!\" dialog? Check.<br/><br/>Camera Footage survives a NUCLEAR ATTACK, despite the fact that a nuke's EMP will still erase digital footage even if it IS protected by a flimsy central park bridge? Check.<br/><br/>... and that's the whole movie. Seriously. Every scene contained something needlessly immersion-breaking which, coupled with the nausea-inducing camera-work made for a decidedly poor movie.<br/><br/>If given the choice of being bitten by one of the little monster-lice from Cloverfield or watching the actual movie, I'd take being bitten. At least then, you'll only feel sick for about half an hour.",
    "Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in \"Mrs Brown\". \"The Young Victoria\" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.<br/><br/>There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.<br/><br/>Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.<br/><br/>Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford's attempt on Victoria's life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria's accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a \"Regency Order\"; the Duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.<br/><br/>There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a \"Danger! Major cliché ahead!\" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in \"Moulin Rouge\").<br/><br/>The main reason for the film's success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make \"The Young Victoria\" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10",
    "While watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of films and TV shows from my youth, first was any of the original Godzilla films, the second, a TV show Ultra Man. The FX were way better here, but, it just made me think of them. I found the film entertaining, no Oscar winner, but, it was good. Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of course, rooting for the good guys.<br/><br/>I also had to think that mankind would have or could have thought of a better defense/offense weapon than giant robots. To bring a fight into the city would have cost trillions of dollars, perhaps Quadrillions of dollars. Okay, I'm reading way to much into it. Watch the movie, you will enjoy it.",
    "June 8, 2002 was an 80's renaissance for me. Playing an emulated ColecoVision on my PC, listening to Huey Lewis, Prince, and Men At Work, watching the A-Team on TNN, and seeing this film from 1989. I still enjoy the decade of feathered mullets, jerri-curled hair, acid-washed jeans, skinny ties, dominant pop music, and terrible fashions. The 90's will never have that to live down (except terrible fashions, but not as bad).<br/><br/>When Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure became the surprise hit of 1989, it made a star of everyone's favorite Lebanese-Canadian-U.S. rock 'n rolling actor, Keanu Reeves, who is one of the top stars at the box office today and one of the few likeable people in Tinseltown. It seems that he still carries a bit of Theodore \"Ted\" Logan in all his movies.<br/><br/>He and Alex Winter (an indie film dynamo) play Bill and Ted, a couple of 80's California dudes who want to start their own rock band (Wyld Stallyons). However, both are flunking in high school and will be expelled unless they get an A+ in history. To make matters worse, Ted will be sent to the military by his father, therefore squashing their dreams of rock stardom. Enter Rufus (George Carlin), a man from the future who plays Clarence to the boys George (shades of It's A Wonderful Life) who gives them a telephone booth. With it, they decide to use it to collect great historical figures and bring them to San Dimas, California to show them how mankind has evolved.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film holds up today. Bill and Ted are truly likeable boneheads and both Reeves and Winter deliver fine performances. Carlin is funny in his appearances, showing that he doesn't need trash-talk to be entertaining. The dialogue is truly amusing, probably because no one talks like that any more. The only weakness is that it's an 80's film, so if you didn't grow up in that era, you might not understand why there's music playing throughout the film, or why everyone looks and dresses so weird (yes, that's how everyone looked in the 1980's). The DVD version is quite nice, but it only has a trailer as a bonus. Still, a must watch, and much better than all the copycat films (including the horrible Dude, Where's My Car?). Party On!",
    "The future of movies doesn't seem too bright since all we're getting are remakes, adaptations and unnecessary prequels/sequels and that's why original stuff like SOURCE CODE can really make my day.<br/><br/>Honestly, the trailers and initial premise didn't seem promising; some soldier can travel back in time and has to stop an some evil terrorist from bombing America. At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it.<br/><br/>Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. <br/><br/>To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.",
    "\"The Godfather: Part II\" is a very suspenseful drama with a very exciting story, with great acting and great special effects. I would definitely recommend you watch this movie...but first watch the original classic from 1972 \"The Godfather\" . The movie may not be as good as the first movie but is still an amazing sequel.",
    "Well, I'll tell you what. I'm not a big fan of animated features but this one was a blast and a half. Just when I thought Flash the Sloth at the Zootown DMV couldn't be topped, we wind up meeting Mr. Big doing the Marlon Brando \"Godfather\" bit. I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn't run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn't stop laughing.<br/><br/>I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis's Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.<br/><br/>As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like 'being all you can be' and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I'll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - \"I want to try even though I could fail...\". It's a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don't measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message.",
    "I really enjoy the Star Trek TV series (original, TNG and DS9) and admit that I am late to this review. As much as I enjoy Star Trek and its ideals I had watched Star Wars The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams and I hated that. Star Wars rebooted with completely non-plot for pre-teens and one-liners, wise-cracks and plot holes so big that even Donald Trump's ego could drive through them was not for me.<br/><br/>So, anyway with a certain amount of hesitation I finally watched the reboot of Star Trek.... and it was as bad as I feared. Since it was expected I was not disappointed, but by gosh what is with the people who hire the director JJ Abrams? He makes every character a cartoon character. Never mind that the utopian and progressive society of the Federation is completely glossed over and ignored, but these characters with the formulaic backgrounds and corny lines and false tensions is just terrible. The Vulcans and Romulans' feud has never been as cliché-ridden I would say.<br/><br/>Look, I get it. People pay for reboots and remakes and sequels and so Hollywood serves them up (or is it the other way around?), but use some imagination, have one novel or original idea at least. I am too old for cartoons... which explains why I won't be watching the next Star Trek or fifteen Star Wars coming out. Obviously the director JJ Abrams is specialized in reboots and remakes and sequels and not original ideas.",
    "First off, let me state emphatically that I'm referring to the REAL version of the film, not the pathetic crippled creature distributed as \"Warriors of the Wind\" on video. Although I must admit that I first fell in love with the movie in that form, I have now seen the full subtitled version, and I place a hideous curse on those who hacked over 20 minutes from its running time.<br/><br/>Although the incredible \"Princess Mononoke\" later upstaged this early work in terms of art and detail, in many ways I still prefer \"Nausicaa\". Its imaginitive and well-conceived world puts me in mind of Dune with its feuding factions, its giant creatures, and its strong ecological message. Even with a rather long running time, the story moves very briskly (boiled down as it was from a very lengthy manga series). The music deserves special mention, as well, as it is a large step up from the electronic pop stylings of most anime.<br/><br/>If you can get your hands on a copy of the original version, you'll find it more than worth the effort.",
    "I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching.",
    "SPOILER: This movie was just magical.<br/><br/>The Force has become like Harry Potter magic, with a new spell every day or so.<br/><br/>Rey is just magical. With practically training whatsoever she can take on Luke and Kylo and win.<br/><br/>Snoke is magical. He appeared out of nowhere in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi has such fantastic Force powers (never before seen in the entire Star Wars Universe) and yet can't tell when his protege is scheming to slice him in two (but could fell his every throught earlier, and even manipulate him and Rey's thoughts and get them to intergalactically Skype each other and even send water through space).<br/><br/>Luke is magical. He can magically project himself light years away and even bring solid things (the lucky dice) with him. Then dies magically for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Yoda is magical. His Force-ghost actually has more Force powers than when he was alive! Calling down lightning from the sky??? Heck, why don't the Jedi just do that when fighting on Tattooine or whatever? And if Force-ghosts still have Force powers why not the whole gang of Anakin, Ben and Yoda take on Snoke?<br/><br/>Rose is magical. She appears out of nowhere and just happens to go along with Finn on a completely unnecessary mission to find a code breaker, and find not one but TWO code breakers, one of which is in the SAME CELL as they are. I mean, is that magical or what?<br/><br/>Leia is magical. Previously in 7 movies only having the barest abilities in the Force, she now can survive in space for quite a long time and even open her eyes without getting them immediately frozen, and Force-Mary Poppins herself back to the space ship. Magical!<br/><br/>I could go on and on. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it's one shameless Deus Ex Machina after another. And don't even get me started on the stupid feminist nonsense, the inane attempt at comedy, the stupid characters who go nowhere in their characterisation, the stupid casino subplot, the stupid \"saving\" of Finn who wanted to sacrifice himself by Rose who magically now has feeling for him and both of them magically survive without getting shot at by the entire First Order army. Oops, I did go on and on.<br/><br/>If you make a movie, you need to make sure your movie stays in the universe it came from. Not invent new rules, new powers, new super villains, new behaviours from old characters, etc. out of bloody nowhere.",
    "A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>\nDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says \"Russell Crowe\", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a \"hunk\" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.<br/><br/>And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.<br/><br/>And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.<br/><br/>At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",
    "Tony D'Amato(Al Pacino) is the head coach of the Miami Sharks who are owned by the Christina Pagniacci(Cameron Diaz) who is using the Miami Franchise only for profit. Trouble stirs up after long time star quarterback Cap Rooney(Dennis Quaid)is injured along with his back up bringing in third string quarterback Willie Beamen(Jamie Foxx) who becomes the face of the franchise after having great game after great game. The only problem is that he plays only with his head and not with his heart, with an aging team that needs an emotional leader to guide them to victory. Also Starring: James Woods, Matthew Modine, LL Cool J, Bill Bellemy, Lawrence Taylor, Charelton Heston, Aaron Eckhart, and John C. McGinley.<br/><br/>In a cinema that rarely produces pro football movies, this is the cream of the crop. It captures the reality along with the heroic story of a nobody rising to the top. The movie is humorous, dramatic, and a thriller for all sports fans.<br/><br/>This is not only one of Oliver Stone's best films but this is also the start of Jamie Foxx's \"good\" acting career. Forget what the critics said about Collateral or Ray being the beginning for Jamie Foxx. It was Any Given Sunday. Willie Beaman is a complex character and Foxx nailed the part. He was magnificent. He played the part to perfection and out shined the great Al Pacino. The supporting cast was also incredible with great performances from Cameron Diaz, LL Cool J, James Woods, and surprisingly John C. McGinley. It is very rare to find a great dramatic football movie but this is definitely one those small few.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the greatest sports movies of all time and it is highly enjoyable for adult audiences.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.",
    "Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.<br/><br/>No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that, you're probably going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.<br/><br/>No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.<br/><br/>The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.<br/><br/>Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.<br/><br/>It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.<br/><br/>That being said, the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.<br/><br/>I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed & bigger budgeted movies, it will be a movie like this one, that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.<br/><br/>And while we're at it, hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive, well acted portrayal.",
    "From hit or miss comedy to Get Out, Jordan Peele proves to us that he has certainly matured as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Get Out is one of the best and most refreshingly original horror movies in the last decade.\nRather than having in your face predictable jump scares and cheesy music, Get Out dwells on the mind and relies on the fear of the unknown while giving subtle messages on racism and what's it like to be black in America and for an anti-racism movie everything is handled very well due to Peele's great writing.\nAs I've already mentioned the best aspect of Get Out is the writing; the characters are intelligent people and behave like logical human beings instead of cliché horror movie idiots. Everything happens for a reason and there is a meaning behind everything. Also unlike other horror movie clichés Get Out doesn't fake its scares or replaces them with needless humour. Instead, the humour (mainly Lil Rel Howery's character) is perfectly balanced with the story and shows up at adequate times.<br/><br/>Creepy, unsettling and filled with brilliant performances (primarily from Daniel Kaluuya) and even better writing, Get Out perfectly represents the US society in its current era.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8+/10",
    "SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. <br/><br/>A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.<br/><br/>The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to \"weed out all non-hackers\". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes \"Cowboy\" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes \"Gomer Pyle\" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. <br/><br/>The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.<br/><br/>The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined \"hours of boredom, seconds of terror\" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. <br/><br/>'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the \"duality of Man\" according to Jung. 10/10",
    "Similar to the first Ice Age, the promotional material for the sequel was out in the theatres way in advance, and courtesy of the Scrat character too, up to its usual antics of getting to that elusive acorn. Here, Scrat opens the movie, and emulating the style of the first, he provides most of the laughs, also as an intermission from the actual scenes from the main cast.<br/><br/>Our gang of prehistoric animals are back - Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabre-tooth Tiger (Denis Leary). We learn that Sid has gone into the early childhood business, educating the young minds of pre-historic brats. However, I felt that this movie was somehow darker in tone than the original. While the original was one which dealt with hope, this one had its setting in extinction, disaster and death.<br/><br/>The valley which they live in is threatened by the melting ice, no thanks to global warming. So all the animals embark on a journey to salvation, to that rumored ark which will save them from the massive floods to come. Along the way, our trio meets up with another trio of characters, who were added to expand the cast, featuring 2 Possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), and another, but female, mammoth (Queen Latifah).<br/><br/>Needless to say, Manny's still anti-social, and Diego can't get along with those rascal possums who get on his nerves, and Sid's the \"philosopher\" ever providing the laughs. Various themes like romance (hey, we got 2 mammoths here), friendship, trust, and believing in oneself to overcome one's phobia get covered. Pretty wide scope, but they manage to fit in place nicely.<br/><br/>The villains in this sequel are pretty nasty, besides the looming natural disaster, we have two sea creatures with nasty teeth and attitude, as well as menacing vultures ever ready to pounce on the flesh of animals who have fallen.<br/><br/>But it's not all that bleak. Keep a lookout too for that mad sloth song-and-dance sequence, which has potential to become the next ear worm ala Madagascar's zany \"you-got-to-move-it\" song. The animation is as usual, top notch, and I just can't get enough of the photo-realistic ice and water landscape.<br/><br/>This is one piece of animation that doesn't rely too much on sight gags, of spoofing current affairs, but one filled with more witty dialogue and kept on an even keel with its interesting storyline. Though at times it might feel clichéd, somehow it excelled in its execution.<br/><br/>And that makes this sequel, as enjoyable as, if not better, than the original. Recommended stuff this week!",
    "I was a Texas Western graduate in 1966 and attended the school all four previous years that Don Haskins (\"the Bear\") coached the basketball team. Of course, Coach Haskins came to TWC in 1961 and built his team over 5 years, not in one year as the movie tells it. I went to every home game in 1965-66 and remember every one as if it were yesterday. I watched all of the away games that were televised, including all of the games the Miners played in the NCAA tournament. Even though the producers of \"Glory Road\" took considerable artistic license, the story is mostly true. Here are some facts. The Miners blew away fourth ranked Iowa during a holiday tournament that season. It wasn't even close as the movie depicts it. The great comeback was against New Mexico in the \"Pit\". When Hispanic guard David Palacio came in to play in the second half, the team seemed to settle down and came from a 20 point deficit to win in overtime. The incredibly close game, and probably best game in America that year between the true best college teams in America was the Regional final between third ranked TWC and fourth ranked Kansas (not #1 Kentucky and #2 Duke in the final four semifinal), when Jo Jo White made that last second basket in overtime with his foot on the base line. The Miners went on to beat Kansas 81-80 in double overtime. Then the Miners beat Utah in the first game of the final four. If white player Jerry Armstrong hadn't defended against Utah's great Jerry Chambers, a black player, the Miners probably wouldn't have made it to the championship game against Kentucky. Chambers was beating every defender badly, including Lattin, Shed, and Flournoy, until Armstrong was put in to cover him. Chambers finished with 38 points, mostly in the first half and was the tournament's MVP.<br/><br/>Coach Haskins is beloved by every El Pasoan, whether living in the city now or not, and is a true American treasure. It's wonderful for the rest of the country and the world to finally learn about \"the Bear\" and his great 1966 Miner team that El Paso has known and loved for 40 years. It's much more than a basketball story, it's a story about tolerance and what hard work and discipline can do through the leadership and determination of a great coach and human being.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, especially Josh Lucas' performance as \"the Bear\". His performance was spot on. The young actors playing on the team were outstanding. The early tensions shown between the black and white players in the movie did not exist according to the real players on that team. The book \"Glory Road\" is a must read, because it tells the true story told by \"the Bear\", Don Haskins, himself. I also recommend David Lattin's book \"Slam Dunk to Glory\". The producers should have shown the real life characters, including Coach Haskins, Pat Riley, and some of the actual 1966 players earlier in the credits, because most of the audiences leave the theater without knowing they're going to be interviewed. I thought that was the most interesting part of the movie. The movie and the story deserve a perfect 10. I hope it wins some awards.",
    "Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot in the way of story and character development, but suffice it to say, it serves its purpose. What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. The pop culture references are still present, but I found them to be more clever and funny this time around, and in much smaller amounts. I was smiling through virtually the entire film, and had about 5 or 6 hard laugh-out-loud moments throughout. As expected, I was also very impressed by the voice cast in this movie. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen's performance as B.O.B.. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway.<br/><br/>The 3D, while not used as effectively as it was in Coraline, is still one of the more impressive showcasings that I've seen, and that's largely due to the film's incredible action sequences. Seriously, this is some of the best action that I've seen in an animated film; as far as I'm concerned, it's right up there with that of The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Monsters vs. Aliens to be a surprisingly entertaining film, with clever and witty dialogue, as well as terrific action. I'm not usually in favor of sequels, but if they're able to keep it as balanced and charming, I would honestly like to see this become a successful, long-running franchise. Nice job, folks at DreamWorks Animation.",
    "It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see \"The English Patient\" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In \"Breaking And Entering\" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in \"The English Patient\", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a \"Minghellian\" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",
    "Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.<br/><br/>He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.<br/><br/>Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",
    "\"Not only is Singer's film-making aesthetically frustrating (lacking coherent visual rhythm) but his juvenile regard of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler -- one of 15 documented attempts -- is intellectually insulting...\" New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film.

A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in.

I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...<br/><br/>What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.<br/><br/>It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.<br/><br/>If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that \"I was on the edge of my seat\" throughout the second half of the film.<br/><br/>So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.",
    "This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.",
    "I saw this movie at a preview event last Friday night and it was hilarious. The sold out cinema was laughing hysterically throughout the movie. The movie is fast paced and does not drag. The comedy is \"r\" rated with a little raunchy adult humor that can be shocking at times but that is in line with the movies theme of male/female relationships.<br/><br/>Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler were both great in the film. Not a role that you would expect to see the King of Sparta, but Butler has great comedic timing complimenting his tough guy persona. And Katherine Heigl is once again perfect doing comedy.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see a typical romantic comedy you will be surprised, because this R rated film is geared toward the men in the audience as well as the ladies. Grab your significant other and be prepared to laugh and enjoy the movie together.",
    "\"I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time\", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use \"the weapon\".<br/><br/>There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10",
    "The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why \"Thirteen Days\" is such a treat.<br/><br/>What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.<br/><br/>At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",
    "While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can.",
    "I love watching movies that leave you just thinking at the end. This movie really did that. Now I'm not really sure why it has such bad reviews but i really liked it and would definitely recommend watching it. <br/><br/>Its not another end of the world movie where your main characters saves their family and end up surviving at the end, which is something i liked because it shows how Nick cages's character has to cope with knowing that him and his family will die and theirs no stopping it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ending and how everything comes together at the end to show that this is Gods doing. You would never expect that from the way its played out, other than the foreshadowing from his son talking about not believing god at the beginning",
    "The first time I saw this film, I was suitably impressed but found I couldn't enjoy it completely.  In order to keep up with the relentless pace of the plot, I didn't pay as much attention to the writing and the performances as I should have.  When it was over, I felt the breakneck pace of the story overshadowed the screenplay and acting, rendering the film an accomplished reprisal of fact but not much else.<br/><br/>What a difference a second viewing made.  My familiarity with the plot allowed me to appreciate all the finer details of the film.   Watching Redford and Hoffman's disciplined performances as Woodward and Bernstein, for instance, is like watching two expert tennis players work in tandem with one another.  When they act together, there is a delightful give-and-take, two masters working their way into a wonderful groove.  While they appear steady and reserved on the surface, the two actors radiate a noticeable undercurrent of excitement and dread, as if underneath their stern countenances they're screaming, \"Holy sh*t!  I can't believe we're doing this!!\"  Redford, not the strongest dramatic actor, finds his normal-guy niche here and gives one of his best performances.  Hoffman is equally strong, making even the simplest scene seem like a masterpiece (the \"count to 10\" phone scene comes to mind).<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Pakula communicates the idea of these two reporters being completely outnumbered by the people responsible for the Watergate break-in.  I loved the numerous overhead shots of Woodward and Bernstein that pull up, up, up, until they're nothing more than specks in the dirty streets of DC.  (This technique is also used in the classic scene where the two guys are searching through old records and the camera pulls up to the ceiling and shows them seated along the edge of a circular series of desks.)<br/><br/>The film rockets right along, leaving the viewers as excited over the reporters' discoveries as they are.  William Goldman's script helps in this regard, I think, sticking straight to the meat and cutting out any unnecessary roughage.  The dialogue gets right down to business while working in realistic vocal habits and the like.  Redford really captures this well (listen to his stammering and self-corrections when he talks on the phone to sources - great stuff!).<br/><br/>I can't recommend \"All the President's Men\" enough.  It's tightly-structured, fiercely-paced, and captivating as all get-out.  If necessary, watch it twice: once to find out who's who, the second time to savour the handiwork.  If you want to talk more about it, leave a red flag on the potted plant on your balcony.",
    "Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",
    "Definitely not my favorite of the 3 but it's hard when the first 2 were just that good. It still portrays well, from my historical knowledge, much of the struggle of the mob families to legitimize their business dealings and try to enjoy life in the later age of the mafia in America. Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films.",
    "Please take my review with a grain of salt. I don't really write reviews, but I really felt compelled to say something about this movie and it's decaying genre.<br/><br/>I'm conflicted, because I know my opinion is getting more and more jaded with every new superhero flick- but I am quickly reaching the end of my rope here. All these movies feel so predictable and cliché anymore, and as much as I truly want to enjoy them it is becoming more and more difficult.<br/><br/>The main actors in this movie were pretty good, but what can you do with yet another weak story that has already been rehashed in other films. The writing felt subpar, and in the end it came off as being full of gimmicks and convenient sub plot.<br/><br/>It just doesn't feel real anymore, it doesn't feel believable. It feels like a fantasy world created for superfans who never take a step back and critique.<br/><br/>These superhero movies are becoming more and more uninspired, and while I try to give them all a chance I am just getting tired of it all. It feels like the quality is being diluted, all that matters anymore is the quantity. All that matters is the money.<br/><br/>I still hold out hope- just look at the 'zombie' genre. Just because there is dilution within the genre doesn't mean a sporadic gem can't be made. However, if you are of a similar mindset as me, you might want to keep looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!",
    "No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in \"10 Rillington Place\" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in \"American Psycho\". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",
    "There are few elements that actually work in this prequel, but none of them are enough to compensate for the lack of creativity, poor execution, terrible writing and awful looking special effects, ruining what it could've been a potentially promising spin-off from a great character.",
    "Amistad is a very well crafted, well acted, and well told story. It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad 'mutiny', and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America's darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.<br/><br/>Amistad ranks as one of McConaughey's finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. <br/><br/>Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.",
    "A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands' competition.<br/><br/>Unbelievable? Yes. What's more unbelievable is that somehow the whole thing works  Jack Black's over-the-top enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, the edge-of-disaster suspense is continued throughout the length of the movie, and by the end the audience is so desperate to see how the kids (who they all play their own instruments by the way) perform in the concert that seat wetting would probably go unnoticed. Joan Cusack, as the gobsmacked headmistress, delivers a performance that is worth the price of your cinema ticket in itself. Achieving such tears-down-the cheeks laughter and adrenalin-packed excitement for air guitar music is nothing short of miraculous.<br/><br/>School of Rock is a movie that promises entertainment and delivers. Everything is as it says on the packet. For sheer feelgood factor, this movie is unbeatable  and you can even take the kids!",
    "No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. Because they don't need to. The Spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are. But that doesn't mean they should not try to. Why did this movie get made? Simple, Sam Raimi wasn't given enough time to make a fourth spider-man film so he quit, and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen. This movie wasn't made for any other reason.<br/><br/>First off, Peter Parker doesn't have a goal in this movie. At first its to find out what happened to his parents, which isn't explained in this movie. After half an hour he now tries to control his new powers, in scenes that don't help the audience. In the original spider-man, Peter learned about his powers in a controlled environment, he didn't beat up innocent people on a subway train. It's nice to know no one on that train reported that a man beat up five people while climbing walls. But Peter learning his powers can't be an entire focus in the movie, so we kill Uncle Ben. This time it doesn't work because the only reason Peter let the criminal get away was because Peter couldn't get a chocolate milk. To get so upset that he couldn't afford a chocolate milk that he would let a robber get away with the stores money is a contrivance in every way. So for about ten minutes Peters new goal is to bring uncle Ben's murderer to justice, let the police can't link all these look alike criminals spider-man does capture with the man who did kill peters uncle. After a while he just stops doing this, with no reason! And there is still about an hour left, so what are we going to do now? How about introduce that main villain you've been promising us? The Lizard is horribly written in every scene he's in. Why does he go to so much trouble to knock cars off of a bridge just to tell one guy (who is never seen afterwords) that their vaccine isn't ready yet? Because we needed another action scene. After that they bring up that the daily bugle wants pictures of the lizard, a point that doesn't amount to anything, except the lizard finding out who spider-man is. For someone as smart as Peter Parker has been set up to be it was really stupid for him to put his name on the camera he was using to take pictures of the lizard.<br/><br/>The climax doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first being this is the same climax we've seen in about four other superhero movies. The second one being there are no stakes. Only half of Manhattan would be infected 8 minutes after the lizard started his chemical missile, decreasing the people at risk greatly. Also THERE'S A CURE FOR THIS!! You know, the thing Gwen has been working on for the past 6 minutes? Whoever gets infected can just get the cure shot into them afterwords, and as of right now there are only 10 people infected, so why waster your time trying to put the cure into the missile that will stretch half of Manhattan and only effect 10 people?! <br/><br/>Gwen Stacy's dad dies and tells Peter to leave Gwen out of this, and proceeds to still date Gwen. What a great way to respect someone who died protecting people! Don't watch this movie, don't waste your time with this movie, even Spiderman 3 was better than this, so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy, at least those movies had effort put into them.",
    "I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. <br/><br/>I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone",
    "Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, \"balanced\" historical story from a perspective \"within\" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10.",
    "2012's Magic Mike wasn't exactly about the stripping. Sure, it features a lot of it, but the real center of the movie was the lifestyle of its main character, Mike. This latest installment showcases more of the crew and how they put up the show. It's more choreography driven than some commentary, which actually made it more appropriate to this material. It still has the stunning style of the first one, though it mostly feels quite forced, but if the movie tries to be itself, then there it actually shines. Magic Mike XXL indeed brings much of what you expect from it.<br/><br/>While the first movie basically shows the art of its aesthetics, this sequel rather shows the art of stripping. The story isn't quite remarkable; it's so simple that it's nothing more than an excuse to show more of these acts, which is both a good thing and otherwise. But really, that's what the target audience really came here for. Just like the first one, it's all atmosphere than following a plot. We just see these characters trying to get along, hint some commentary, and do some stripping. The difference however is the stripping is the real showcase, as in the direction and choreography improves within that aspect which makes these performances speak what this movie is truly about. People would immediately think that this would only appeal female viewers, but even as a straight man as I am, I would actually be impressed by the choreography displayed on those scenes.<br/><br/>The direction does try to keep Soderbergh's style going in this sequel, though only eschewing the intense sepia and welcoming other colors on the daylight. The new style is sometimes indefinite, specifically the vague lighting in some scenes, but then, the movie eventually breaks the pretense once the characters start dancing on screen, having more focus on their moves, and of course, bodies. Star, Channing Tatum, still has the charm as he always has. The other performers also get their characters expanded, staying natural whenever they bond and fight off on screen, treating them beyond than typical eye candy compared to the first one.<br/><br/>Many may call Magic Mike XXL a totally needless sequel or a cash grab for those who seek for more endless dose of shirtless men, but I believe this movie actually exists to make up for its own value. The story may not be as meaty as its predecessor's, but it shows everything what its audiences actually wanted for it. And it is done elegantly, proving that stripping apparently has more to offer than just lust for flesh. It sounds incredibly weird if you say it that way, but looking at these performances seems like this is an art that we didn't see coming. Again, there's nothing remarkable about the story, though if you're curious about the appeal of this career, then it gives a room for fascination.",
    "I give this movie a 10 because it has a message. It has a true purpose to it, which effects nearly every man on the planet.<br/><br/>Ladies, you can listen to this, but be reasonable. Guys, we all masturbate. Some of us do it more than others, most of us look at porn. Some of us only masturbate to porn and some of us have real hard fetishes.<br/><br/>This movie points to the problem, the process of porn turning our heads, making us believe in perfection and making us ultimately selfish as lovers.<br/><br/>You watch porn, you don't have to please a woman, you don't have to worry about anyone but yourself. It is all perfect. In the real world, in relationships, the other person matters just as much as you, but sometimes, even the real thing is not as good as the fantasy and the ease of it.<br/><br/>Don Jon is about that confusion of liking and appreciating porn more than real women, of becoming addicted to the idea of 'perfection' and the ultimate realization of the effect it has on all us men, making us irritated little boys, incapable of truly connecting with another person.<br/><br/>The message is not that porn is bad, only the way we think and use it is misleading to reality.<br/><br/>But, this is not the type of movie to watch with the family, the girl; it's funny, but not a comedy in a spoof and clown type of way. Watch this movie alone, think about yourself and how porn effects you. It will benefit you greatly.",
    "That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.<br/><br/>This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.<br/><br/>The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.<br/><br/>I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.<br/><br/>I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.<br/><br/>This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant \"hungry for more.\" Revisiting this as an adult makes me say the same thing about the movie he is in.<br/><br/>Edit: Nearly 11 months later, 7/7 people found the review helpful.

    "Paper abstract:\n\nWe propose a method to randomize the dimension of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) before training using an approximation of sparse logistic regression (LS). Our approach takes advantage of the fact that the L-norm obtained across the full input data can be used directly as an approximation of the logistic loss. We find empirical evidence that random random L-norm approximation has a large effect on learning, despite its small cost.\n\nWe use this effect to implement and evaluate a method which involves random initialization of the L-norm, and random dropout from an L-norm. We observe that our method consistently outperforms the logistic regression and the current state-of-the-art in several machine learning algorithms such as multi-label classification, regression, and decision trees. This demonstrates the potential of random L-norm approximation in deep convolutional neural networks.\n\nThis work is a proof-of-principle of the Random-Linear-Regressive Pruning Method for Deep Learning using a Random L-Norm. In short the algorithm involves random initialization of logistic loss and random dropout from L-norm. In the following we outline the details of how we did this and how this algorithm performs at the level of deep learning. We then use this to prove the generalization of the above and show that similar results can be obtained via a different approach.\n\nWe believe that our approach demonstrates that random L-norm can greatly accelerate learning in deep learning through its ability to rapidly adapt and improve in complex environments.",
    "Yesterday, at about 11:35 AM, I had a very serious thought about ending my life. For two minutes, I considered calling the police and letting them send someone over to my place, but I didn't do that, because I realized that what could really happen with that was that the police would make it look like a suicide. I considered calling my sister instead, but at the time I thought I would get a much quicker response from my friends and family if I just told them what a dumb idea that was, and that if anyone came to the door I was just kidding around about it. I decided to hang up the phone, walk over to my bedroom window and look out, and take some pictures as I thought of what to do.\n\nI noticed how much I weighed. I was probably about 190lbs, which would put me about 5'5\" and a size 16 or 17. The first number was a bit too small for me at the time. Of course, at the time the weight didn't matter, but in retrospect, I realized I should have weighed myself with a digital scale and recorded the results... That would have been easier for everyone.\n\nJust as I reached my balcony, I noticed that I felt very light. I had no muscular tone at all, even the day before. Bystanders would have thought I was faking it to get out of their way. I was not faking it to get out of their way. I realized something quite important that day: I wanted to end something important to me with as little external drama as possible. I didn't want to end my life for anyone but myself, at the time.\n\nI figured that my most important people would be my family and friends. After that, I'd try to convince my coworkers. That might be easier for me, but that's just sort of how it would have gone.\n\nAbout the time I realized I needed to put up some pictures for myself, I started feeling funny. I wasn't feeling good, my eyes were watering and my mouth tasted weird. Maybe it was my stomach getting upset after being full all day. I went to the bathroom because I was worried about having a heart attack or something serious. I had forgotten to take my usual insulin. I felt a bit sick, but I figured that was an interesting coincidence. I knew I couldn",

    "Purely Algebraic Approach to the Generalized Jacobian Conjecture\n\nEli Dahan\n\nThe Jacobian conjecture is a widely held conjecture about a geometric structure, the graph H(|z|), in which we can reduce the graphs in E. M. Peano's group theory to the single-to-one case of Minkowski order. It is true that any two graphs of degree |z| have an inverse of the same degree, and that is, this conjecture can be made to hold. The conjecture is named after Alan Turing, who first formulated it in his paper On computable numbers of the natural numbers [1] and later proved it using the famous result by Cantor, of creating an infinite set of numbers out of a set of natural numbers [2].\n\nProof that the conjecture can be made to hold requires proving the result that we have a function ƥ(d): ∀z|z-x|y=d|x<=y. Here, the term ƥ(d)-d is a polynomial in d that corresponds to a non-constant inverse of d. The problem is in finding such a polynomial ƥ(d)-d, and to do so, first we need to show that ∀z⊗x(z⊗x)-x(z⊗y)-x(z⊗y)⊗x⊗y≤. Here the symbol ⊗ represents the function ƥ(z)+ƥ(x), and the ⊗es are an important feature of the graph H(|z|) of degree |z|. As shown in the original paper [1], the graph is then reduced to the non-constant case of Minkowski order in a polynomial time computation, and this is the key to the conjecture.\n\nThis paper discusses the proof of the generalization conjecture using algebraic approaches. We consider the polynomial ƥ(x), the operation ƥ(x)-ƥ(x) and the constant. We apply the theorem that for all a ⊗ b: ⊗ → ⊗, a ⊗ b ⊗ ƥ",
    "Introduction Some aspects of the theory of automorphisms in cohomology theory are important. For instance, the automorphisms of a particular homogeneous curve in a cohomology group form a cohomology space with a certain property, which may be useful in the theory of groups. In this paper we consider a new form of the automorphism group on curves, whose automorphisms consist of curves of an arbitrary rank, namely those which are a product of an algebroject and a finite automorphism class such that, for all,,, such that. However, what we are interested in is the automorphism group on curves, where the topology of is arbitrary as in a typical representation of, and not necessarily compact as in the general representation of, where. Specifically, the automorphism group of such curves forms the generalization of the group on a point, where. On a curve we suppose for a point. Let us think of an isomorphism (in the sense of the group ) in the category of finite groups. In this paper we give an algorithm for the definition of such isomorphisms, and show that there exists such an isomorphism among two curves of rank, that is, such that there is a family of automorphisms and such that for all. We also give a definition for non-commutative rings in a cohomology group of curves, and prove that this ring has an isomorphism of group automorphisms, i.e., between all automorphisms in a cohomology group of curves. As a result, we obtain the statement about the automorphism group on curves. The following results in the theory of automorphisms in cohomology theory are obtained by applying the method of automorphisms. The automorphisms of a group of manifolds\nProof of the second condition. In particular, as one may infer from the theorem of the group automorphism group on curves, we are given that is a homogeneous curve in the category of (spaces of automorphisms in a cohomology group of curves), but is not in the category (for a homogeneous curve). One can find a homogeneous curve in. Such a homogeneous curve in, i.e., such a",
    "NEW YORK (InsideBitcoins) — The unemployment rate fell to a 15-year low in the U.S. in January, according to state officials reported on Thursday, further bolstering the country's job market even as President Donald Trump pushes policies aimed at spurring U.S. manufacturing growth. The BLS released the numbers at the end of the 12th month of data. As of Friday, it reported that the unemployment rate had fallen to 4.9 percent from 4.9 percent the previous month and to 4.8 percent five years ago, when Barack Obama first took office. \"The unemployment rate is just about where it need to be for these people to start putting more money in the economy … to help it grow,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"It's a good sign.\"\n\nAs I've said in recent interviews and commentary, the U.S. economy has grown significantly faster in the past four years, even with the massive federal government spending programs which were created by former President Barack Obama.\n\nWe have seen a surge of economic growth under President Donald Trump, and are now experiencing the economic growth that the media and the Washington establishment long warned was coming, with both Republican and Democrat politicians praising the president, despite the many areas of concern that still face the nation.\n\nSo if it is possible to show that economic growth has continued under President Donald Trump's protectionist economic policies, why has the media and the establishment in Washington and Wall Street gone along with the policies on a daily basis?\n\nIt is no wonder why the Trump administration continues to be attacked by the media and the establishment when a massive drop in crime has followed this president's protectionist policies and as U.S. corporations continue to bring in record profits, even with an incredibly weak global economy.\n\nThat massive drop in crime and the subsequent economic revival is exactly what is happening.\n\nIt is simply not believable that the economy is now growing so quickly with record highs in the Dow and the stock market with the unemployment rate at a 16-year low.\n\nIt is impossible for the same media that claimed economic growth would end under both George W. Bush and Obama to have gone along with this huge economic growth, based on the massive government spending programs which they have created or which are being funded by President Donald Trump.\n\nAs expected,",
    "I'm a therapist and am beyond tired of being polite to covidiot clients. When I see my patients' faces fill with tears, I can't help but wonder why they're not crying. Or I can see a patient's face, and know something has gone awry, but have no clue what. What's going on that makes a person act an awful lot like a child, rather than a person, because of the way he or she is \"expressing\" certain emotions?\n\nOne possibility is that they are unconsciously trying to make us feel bad, even though their actions don't correspond to their expressions. They may be acting out with anger and frustration because they are angry at being told: 1. We're wrong; 2. We can't be trusted or treated fairly; 3. We hurt them; 4. They don't matter; 5. The world is an ugly place. Because you are wrong. So be angry at us instead. And so be hurtful to us instead, even when you are totally innocent, as soon as you find yourself in a situation where you might be accused of having done something wrong. You might act just like they do. You might even look exactly like them. Just think about the implications: 1. If they treat you badly, do you then treat them badly? 2. If the world sucks, do you not treat it any better? 3. But they hate you, and it's all your fault? 4. It's not really their fault, but they're being jerks all the same? But why would that be? Well, it could be a reaction to their childhood experiences of mistreatment from their parents; the idea that their parents are right, and you're wrong, despite the fact you got no worse. 5. I think it's their fault. But they were jerks then. Maybe they're even worse. Or maybe they're okay. It doesn't change the fact that they're jerks. It might make them less jerks when they realize their behaviour was wrong.\n\nWell, there's just one problem with this scenario: it doesn't happen to any of us.

    "The \"black box\" problem. As we've discussed recently, if we take the safety of our vehicles for granted, the cars themselves might be as well. Cars currently have internal systems designed to protect humans from some risks of accident, but not others. If an autonomous car is trying to handle an emergency at a high speed, it might not be able to tell whether a cyclist is still on the road before it loses control of the vehicle. It might make an error, in a manner that could be detected by its sensors, but the resulting crash could be preventable. The \"black box\" system used in the new cars is a new development which, for instance, in the case of the Tesla, is designed to monitor crash data as well as to alert drivers of potential emergencies. In the future, the use of these \"black boxes\" in cars – and similar technologies – could improve a car's performance and safety, but they are not entirely risk-free.\n\nHere's the entire text:\n\n\"A question of trust and technology\" (from bbc.com)\n\nThe Tesla is one of the biggest and best-known names in the luxury market. The car is capable of producing zero-emissions electric power in a \"fully electric powered\" mode, meaning it no longer requires a traditional engine. In addition to that, to save fuel, it has built-in electric motors to operate the steering, brake and other systems. If the car does crash, such as during an emergency trip, all the systems that the Tesla uses to drive can also be easily disabled to halt its progress to a stop. This is all made possible by an array of sensors and computer systems that can analyse the surroundings to detect the state of the car and its surroundings, not only its condition before the accident occurred but also as it is in process of being repaired.\n\nThe safety of the car has always been a top priority for Tesla. It will be the first car in the world using Tesla's \"autopilot\" technology. It is designed to operate using the latest artificial intelligence algorithms developed by a team of engineers at Tesla. In the case of an emergency the driver can take over, but if the driver is driving at highway speeds a more relaxed mode of operation is used, similar to a cruise control. A \"black box\" is built into the car to record data gathered from the",
    "In object-oriented environments, the concept of object prominence is highly context-dependent due to the difficulty of understanding and interpreting object attributes. While computer vision technology is able to detect a significant number of objects in a scene that need to be identified accurately, the detection and recognition are time-consuming and subject to both the complexity of the objects in the scene as well as the difficulty of comprehending them, which increases the need for more detailed and contextual information in the recognition process. While previous work proposes simple neural models of object prominence [1], many different approaches and architectures have been used for this task, from neural networks and image processing techniques to human-like face recognition. Given the wide variety of approaches for object prominence detection, we conducted three separate experiments exploring three different approaches: Deep Convolutional Networks for Object Preference, Hierarchical Temporal-Temporal Layers as an Improved Deep Convolutional Network, and Hierarchical Temporal-Temporal-Expansive Linear Feedback for Object Preference. The experiments included subjects with and without object-related cognitive impairments that affected the detection and recognition of objects in image and video scenes [2], and we found that the hierarchial nature of a hierarchical recurrent neural network that uses temporal feedback significantly reduced the amount of time necessary to perform high-level object-preference tasks. This was supported by a similar finding for the hierarchical hierarchical temporal-temporal Layers (THEL) implementation [3], for both unsupervised and object-related recognition tasks. Hierarchical Temporal-Temporal Coding networks can also improve object-related recognition. Hierarchical temporal-temporal Coding can be used in the sense that we use temporal feedback rather than linear feedback. It is possible to improve the accuracy of object-preference recognition under an object-specific input condition even if the image and video scene is not subjectively perceived to be oriented in a particular direction. Hierarchical temporal-temporal coding is supported by convolutional neural networks, which can efficiently recognize images and videos given a well-defined, low-level representation of object prominence in the scene. In the Hierarchical Temporal-Temporal Coding for Object Preference study, we conducted both unsupervised and supervised object-preference recognition and found that neural networks can",
    "The Conservative Party has been left reeling this morning after a close ally of David Cameron died aged 68.\n\nMichael Meyer – described by colleagues as \"my leader\" and one of the most influential people in the Conservative Party – died after a year battling liver cancer.\n\nMr Meyer had been a senior figure within Mr Cameron's policy unit, the Policy Club, which helps shape his election manifesto.\n\nThe cause of his death is not yet known.\n\nHis death came as a shock to those working closely with him. \"He was one of the nicest men I have ever met, he was so well liked, people who knew him are weeping at this terrible news,\" said one Conservative.\n\nMr Meyer had two adult children but declined to comment on them.\n\nHis work in policy, which was described by one colleague as \"magnificent,\" was in keeping with his personal style, and had proved an effective source of controversy.\n\nIn 2013 he was accused of \"stalking\" then-Labour prime minister Gordon Brown – a charge he denied – over his advice.\n\nLater that year the Policy Club was accused of failing to stand up for its core mission over the government's welfare cap, which Mr Meyer had said would \"create a huge incentive for those seeking to abuse the system\". It was accused of overreacting to the government's failure to include \"universal support\" in the policy.\n\nIt is understood Mr Meyer was not working for the Policy Club after the accusations over stalking.\n\nHis personal life saw him fall in love with the same woman in 1991, and they both remained close allies until his death. He was married to the former Susan Jones, wife of disgraced Labour MP Michael Jones.\n\nMr Meyer was \"really quite a good bloke,\" said former policy director of the Policy Club, Dr Andrew Cooper.\n\n\"He had a lovely sense of humour, he had loads of friends. He was a good family man too, and he was very close to his family,\" said Dr Cooper.\n\n\"He was a bit eccentric but he was a bit of an eccentric in a nice way. He was just a proper jolly bloke who liked to do a bit of jolly bit of politics,\" he said.\n\nHis death comes days after the Prime Minister announced a \"totally new approach\"",
    "The action has been given to an army of four American soldiers who have been left behind in Afghanistan. When a cargo plane crashes into a mountain area near Camp Bastion in Afghanistan, one of our soldiers is blown out of the plane, he then uses a helicopter to jump from the plane and retrieve himself. After he has gotten to safety he decides to put the helicopter down in an area where they could take part in an air assault on the Taliban, however the Taliban has taken control of the area and they have captured the helicopter pilots, forcing the POWs to take part in a battle where the odds might not be in their favor and the battle could be their last.\n\nWhat caught my attention was the very serious tone on which the movie was written. Yes, the film has plenty of action, but it's the themes of war and people and the war itself that really set it apart from war films that have been produced recently. It's a film with a very heavy sense of irony and a feeling of deep sorrow and sorrow for all those that will undoubtedly see this film and come away with a different perspective on the war itself.\n\nThe writing by Robert Schenkkan takes the typical war narrative and has a very serious tone going. The movie doesn't need to have tons of intense combat scenes or explosions to be an authentic movie to me, but it needs an emotional level and a tone well below the usual type of bombastic action films that we are used to seeing lately.\n\n\nIn one of the most powerful moments in the movie, the audience sees the POWs in a helicopter with the pilot still inside it and the helicopter crashing next to a village. The pilot lands on the ground in front of the village and a villager walks up to the pilot and tries to take him away to safety. The pilot refuses to accept the invitation to go back to his life again and the villager starts hitting him and beating him with a stone. Another POW then gets in and sits beside the pilot. The man walks to the villager and sticks out his tongue. The guy says, \"I don't need a handout, I'm a soldier and I'll do it myself.\" Then the man kicks him in the head.\n\nThe other POW then walks to the pilot and asks him, \"I've heard many times about the war, what are you doing here?\" Now at this point I could",
    "This paper is a continuation of a more recent work where we have tried to identify spin-orbit coupling by looking into the thermal radiation from Bose gases moving under the influence of magnetic and rotational forces. To do so we performed a numerical study of an example of Bose gas magnetically confined by a magnetron for a short period of time. The results are expected to give a possible explanation for why, within the gas, only the magnetron radiation is observed.\n\nAt least one previous study has examined magnetic fields in spin-orbit coupled Bose gas systems, where they found a Bose correlation, but that study's main goal was to determine the strength and duration of the correlations, which this new paper does not attempt to reach. Instead, they are interested in determining what makes these types of Bose gas systems magnetized in the first place (as opposed to being just magnetic).\n\nUsing computer simulations performed by John T. Hildebrand and colleagues, we found that the magnetic field of spin-orbit coupled Bose systems results from the magnetic properties as well as the spin-orbital mechanics of atomic spins and that both these properties were able to generate a long-lived spin-orbit coupling. We also noted with statistical significance that the period of the magnetic coupling of the spin-orbital and atomic spins is longer using the high magnetic field of a magnetron. A stronger magnetic field was also found to cause a stronger spin-orbit coupling.\n\nThese conclusions were found in our computations performed in combination with theoretical simulations using the classical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen mechanism and a new formalism developed by Jelle M. Rietveld. It is expected that in the future a deeper understanding of these types of Bose (gas) magnetic systems could offer new insights into some of the most fundamental aspects: the nature of gravity, the origin of the cosmos, and even, by understanding some of the most basic processes in nature, perhaps explain such aspects as the creation of the universe or the origin and evolution of life.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that this research is independent of NASA and the RAS program as it is funded by the National Science Foundation.",
    "I've got to give it out to TSA, their uniforms are really hot, and they keep you from being able to see them without a uniform on. My friend is a growing and he always has to go through the x-ray scanner but he says he's always fine. I've been going through it for a few years now and have never been touched by TSA, but as soon as I start to see those green squares on my body (they are basically a little radar device) I get really nervous. I have been warned by my friend that there have been a couple times when being scanned and I will get upset when their eyes are on me. I have also seen them use body scanners and they have always been in pairs. When I was being interviewed, they asked me about the scanner and if I've ever had an allergic reaction, how my body reacts to it, what I did to prepare for it, and how you are supposed to be looking to the edges of your body (you should always be looking in the back for the front). There were several other questions to which they could have asked and didn't. For example the one I asked, \"I was going to be a grower but my hands were hurting, so why can't my hands be scanned, instead of my torso?\" They couldn't come up with an answer that made sense. They didn't even seem to know what the scanner is (it's actually a machine that they will use to detect explosives) or why it's necessary. It's just a scan. I went back in after their allotted interview time and asked about getting my body scanned again. I was told that they haven't heard of this happening and that they will be sending my name in again for the next round of interviews and then I'll be getting my physical (a small piece of paper you give to a private nurse to take your picture for a background check). They then told me that the x-ray machine at the security line has now stopped working for a week which is really strange, because it's a few blocks away from the security line. Once the x-ray machine starts working again I'm sure you'll hear about that. I think it's really ridiculous that this technology exists in the first place, especially on flights.",
    "In honor of Father's Day, I want to highlight a very important aspect of my experience–the effect that my faith and the actions of others has had on who I am and helped me to grow into the man I am today:\n\nLife does not begin at birth, and it does not stop with death. There was a time in my life that a part of me wondered if it was really worth living. I was in college. I was dating a girl I felt really connected to, but I felt I could get along with other women more easily. I had no reason to want to leave my \"harem\". I just didn' t feel right doing it. I wanted to be with her, but I wasn't ready to commit. I thought she owed it to me to stay with me one way or another.\n\nI wondered how I would act if things were different. How could I ever feel safe in a situation as simple as \"I need to get out of bed before 5pm\" again, assuming it were the middle of the night. The idea of being so far removed from reality that the ability to make rational decisions didn't even exist seemed unreal. I would get more depressed and worried for the girl I loved.\n\nI thought about if I could survive it. My parents would worry and I would think, \"I don't think I could do this alone.\" My friends would worry and I would think, \"They won't always be there for me.\" In time, I stopped. I found things to take care of. I had a good job. I made a lot of money. I bought a house. I went on a lot of adventures. These things were things that I wouldn't have done, if I had had to live without God's help.\n\nI think that I'm much more of an atheist than I'm a Christian. I've learned things about the world that I didn't know before. My spirituality has evolved in a meaningful way. Being religious is a choice. The best thing about religion was being able to believe without having to believe. I found a lot of comfort knowing that there was someone, somewhere, who had my back. Religion had that allure.

To use the feature perturbation methods, researchers must first create a dataset and a model that can fit with the specific parameters. Researchers then compare feature perturbation methods on that dataset. Their goal is to increase the quality of the data, which typically requires the creation of a new dataset by using existing non-parsimonious data to generate the desired feature categories.\n\nIt is quite hard to quantify the extent that perturbations in feature models change the uncertainty in the data, known as segmentation uncertainty. We address this issue by using a statistical approach that integrates predictions from the model with actual data to identify patterns in the data's variability. We then apply segmentation uncertainty analysis techniques to evaluate how well feature perturbation methods predict model uncertainty.\n\nOur work can potentially change the treatment of segmentation uncertainty with regards to prediction and training. However, our work does not answer the general question of whether a particular perturbation method improves data quality. As such, this work also examines three distinct questions:\n\n(1) Does perturbations in feature models affect the accuracy of predictions? (2) Does perturbations affect the structure of the data? and (3) Does perturbations alter the model's accuracy?",
    "When the Green Party candidate in the UK general election went into the final three weeks of campaigning only six points behind the Conservatives, he was described as 'disappointed'.\n\nAs the polls closed on Monday, the LibDems held two seats and secured one Labour MP as results began to trickle in. Labour's share of the vote fell in the last few days of campaigning.\n\nGreen Party co-leader Caroline Lucas is the current frontrunner for the seat. Yesterday she won a comfortable victory in Brighton Pavilion. Polls suggest her Conservatives are poised to win their second seat in the south of England on Thursday.\n\nThe Green Party and Labour each received over half of all votes cast in the north of England. The SNP and the Liberal Democrats received fewer votes and may each leave the contest on a low.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, David Cameron said the Tory candidate \"would not have made it this far\" without voters throwing away three years of government.\n\nLabour have yet to declare a final winner after their tally of over half of the vote in Scotland dropped off a cliff.\n\nMeanwhile the LibDems were seen fighting hard and appearing confident despite what was by all accounts a tough campaign. The party finished just eight per cent behind the Conservatives in Bristol West and now hold the seat as voters in the seat change sides between parties.\n\nLabour had hoped they would retain their current share of votes and hope that a split between the two main parties didn't result in voters giving either party a second chance.\n\n\"It is great to have delivered five times the result that we have delivered at the last two general elections. We want to look at the seats we have won to make sure that our candidate in this seat will make a very good contribution to the future of this Parliament,\" said David Laws.\n\nHe also praised Lucas as a strong campaigner and the most inspirational politician he has met.\n\n\"She is a very strong candidate... I do not think you can underestimate her abilities as a person. I don't think you can underestimate her enthusiasm for what she has been doing,\" he added.\n\nIt was unclear how a defeat for the LibDems would affect the party over the next few weeks. A result below 13 would also leave the LibDems with nothing in their favour in parliament.\n\nAlthough, a loss in Bristol West would be a catastrophic wipeout for Labour",
    "Color Image Detection with Dynamic Feature Extraction and Fuzzy Particle Swarm Optimization (2014)\n\nSpencer B. Hall:\n\nObject detection as the image processing bottleneck in the human visual system will prove a key computing challenge. Although current image recognition systems use a number of different ways to recognize objects, the most widely used method is known as part-whole matching (PW) detection. PWs (which include the conventional L-means method, and other combinations) can be compared to a traditional classifier which predicts which object a feature image (e.g., the face) belongs to. In contrast, a feature image will contain some amount of contextual information such as shape and color/diffuse intensities. By adding a layer of optimization to the existing PW methods, we have demonstrated a method for color image segmentation in which the image classifies its own input pixels not based on any kind of prior discrimination, but instead uses a novel fuzzy-photon approximation method. This algorithm achieves an estimated precision of 92.75% based on the results of previous work utilizing a much simpler color image segmentation algorithm. We have also shown that the use of adaptive complexity (CAP) allows for a higher level of performance. Based on our new and improved method for color object detection we can expect greater speed-ups in object-based models (such as the one that powers the camera systems in smartphones), better image quality, and higher detection efficiency. We find that this method offers advantages over the two most common color feature extraction methods. However, it does require an image of a smaller aspect ratio to train the algorithm, which could be a limitation for wide-format images. However, while training we see a very high accuracy in terms of number of correct classifications, but significantly higher accuracy than the most popular color matching method, namely the conventional L-means method.\n\nFurther information can be found at:\n\nRiccio, M. and Hall, S.

    "I've noticed, that for certain industries or professions, there are always talented people who got there by working very hard. For some reason, I've always been skeptical. I've read many stories of people who were bad at their position, but somehow got to the top. So with that in mind... what do you think? What have you been the luckiest of your position?\n\nThere are no right and wrong answers here, so I'll just summarize it: you need to be very good at what you do, and work hard to be very good at it. This is not simply an attitude. In order to be good at what you do, you need to have a specific mind-set and work habits.\n\nIt's very hard to summarize it, since it's so hard to teach a new concept, but it's not impossible for you to become the kind of person who is very good at being one thing or another.\n\nNow, as usual, let us have a few examples to see if this seems true to you.\n\nI'll start with a guy that is a full-time trader that made some of the biggest money in the world. The first example is a recent reddit post by an ex-trader of my trading team.\n\nMy job is fairly new for some people who have been in the markets for a period of years. In fact, some say that the financial crisis of 2008/9 was the result of not having had that job.\n\nFrom the guy himself:\n\nI started my trading career from the bottom.\n\nHe said he was doing the bottom-end of volatility trading. He said he was earning some money, but by the end of his first year, most of it had been eaten up by the cost of living.\n\nAfter about a year of that job, he got a temporary promotion:\n\nI managed to move my trading into the \"middle\" of high-volume-low-volatility trading (it was already very active back then). After six months, the \"fever\" had subsided. It was easy to make a decent profit that way.\n\nSo, if you have done this kind of trading, what would you tell someone with a different skill-set who asked what it feels like to be a pro? How about someone who thinks",
    "I am an account manager for a digital marketing agency (the company's name is COVID). A few months ago we tried to start a new website, but I kept having those annoying moments. I had spent hours trying to figure out how to install the WordPress plugin that was supposed to automatically create and update the website, but I failed and kept getting blocked.\n\nI finally tried to install the code from a tutorial. The first time I tried, the site went down. The entire content was gone. So I tried again from a new IP, with the tutorial and my own code, the website went up again. That was fine for a while, but it started to get difficult for our clients.\n\nNow, I know we do a great work, but that's not my goal. What I really meant to suggest is that I was getting frustrated just trying.\n\nThen, this guy named John O'Boyle messaged me telling me about a new plugin called VMWare Media Manager.\n\nI'm a huge fan of this guy, he is an amazing talent and I am forever grateful that he shared this brilliant work with the world. He offered me to join his team and my work with COVID went from boring to exciting. We decided to make a couple changes and decided that we would add more plugins to our portfolio.\n\nVMWare is one of those products you install (or create) once and are done with. It has every feature you could possibly want. We have found it a great place to share our knowledge as the two of us have been programming together for almost a decade (and both have been studying IT for almost two).\n\nSo VMWare Media Manager was the next step. John explained it to me:\n\n\"It's a plugin that lets you work and manage a PC or laptop as if it were a server\".\n\n\"It's free too\".\n\n\"It's powerful. It can be loaded in minutes, and it does all of the things you need from your Windows server\".\n\n\"You just need to configure it, and all of a sudden you have the full power of those devices right in your network and the entire device comes with you\".\n\n\"You can even manage it remotely over SSH\".\n\nSo I downloaded VMWare Media Manager and installed it on a Windows 7 PC.",
    "\"In this highly suspenseful and dramatic thriller, Tom Selleck stars as a Navy officer sent on a secret mission to intercept a boat carrying a nuclear missile. His crewmates, led by Charles Bronson and played by Dick Van Dyke have been infected by a lethal strain of tuberculosis and are confined to the ship, unaware of their situation. A fire aboard the Navy ship forces Captain Selleck (a brilliant but emotionally distant actor) to take the most unconventional and secretive mission of his life.\"\n\nSelleck's character, Captain Selleck, doesn't realize that his crew and the ship he's leading have been infected by a lethal strain of tuberculosis or that the only source of shelter and food they'll have is a makeshift bunker built out of a nearby nuclear reactor. Also on board the USS Seago, a nuclear-powered submarine, is a man named John F. Kennedy, who is suffering from a similar illness but is immune to the deadly strain. Aided by Kennedy's medical team, Selleck travels down the bow of the Seago and finds a tunnel leading to an underground bunker where a nuclear missile can be safely launched. Kennedy's team, however, don't know of Selleck's secret mission of an hour and a half until it's too late.\n\nThe movie, shot mainly in New Mexico and Oregon with some location work in South Africa, plays on two themes important to people living today. First, how a man can get infected with a disease, whether through a bite, airborne particle or through a blood transfusion, and not know it; and second, how that disease can spread to others unless you have control of the disease in your body.\n\nNo Man's Land is one of those rare movies that's based on a real, real event and puts the story in the present tense.

    "Context\n\nThe human visual system is typically very good at face and skin recognition, but is not nearly as good at object detection. In general, face detection and object detection are computationally expensive, and the cost can be substantial. Several groups have studied various approaches for boosting the performance of face detection, and we have recently reported an approach that uses local prior knowledge to guide training to better match a user's visual data. A more generally applicable class of models that exploit prior knowledge on object detection can be used to improve the accuracy at object and face detection, at the cost of increasing computational burden on existing large scale data-mining systems. Previous work shows that these prior-guided models can significantly improve detection performance. However, due to the complexity of the problem, it is unclear what level of prior knowledge or model complexity is required to achieve these improvements and how to design a model that efficiently learns to generalize to new data to achieve the improvements. In this paper we propose a model which uses local models on an image pre-trained on a large number of images. We show that this local representation performs better than conventional prior-guided models on both face and object detection. By combining the ability to exploit local knowledge with strong local learning we provide a robust solution for tackling data-hungry image segmentation. Our model achieves over 20X improvement across the two target classes, which enables accurate object detection without further training (see Figure 3). We compare several ways to improve the performance of our local prior-guidance, including using a more fine-grained prior to determine the image properties. This is shown in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 2. Perceptual Prior Prediction with Deep Belief Nets on Face Detection. The deep belief nets are used for prediction on faces using a fine-grained perceptual prior at layer 2. The network is trained for face detection (top left), skin detection (top right) and object detection (bottom left). The resulting network is then used to improve the performance compared against the original network (top right). This is a good example of how a strong prior can be used to improve the performances when the prior is fine-grained. Full size image\n\nFigure 3. Deep Prior-Guided Local Models.

    "Abstract. In this paper, we present a novel method for automatically determining the probability distribution of a test set's missing values. The method is based on a simple yet effective approach to inferring missing values from a test set without relying on empirical hypothesis testing. A theoretical proof of the algorithm can be found in Section 4.1. A practical application of this method is described in Section 4.2. Finally, we demonstrate an optimal method of estimating the distribution of test set missing values by examining a large corpus of text and finding the best fitting test set with the smallest estimated error. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1, we introduce the testing algorithm, analyze the nature of missing value estimation errors, and introduce the corpus of real-world data in which to test this strategy. Then, we introduce the best fitting test set, analyze the test set's values after it has been estimated, and examine the best performing test set after it has been tested. Sections 2 and 3 describe a practical application of the algorithm on the TextTrack corpus. In Section 4 and 5, we show that this strategy reliably outperforms alternatives based on the empirical hypothesis testing approach. We finally summarize our results and identify some additional applications of the algorithm.\n\nThis is a great article from Ars Technica – I have personally done some of my own research for this. It's very interesting:\n\nAs long as we're working with the assumption that there will always be data missing somewhere in the corpus, the solution to this problem is to try out all kinds of approximations for the data to find the best set of classes to represent the missing value data. Then, you can select a subset of classes that have the smallest error, with the assumption that the errors will be proportional to the number of classes that the user is missing:\n\nBut now what if there's an additional problem that you're trying to solve? Maybe, one of the classes you've just selected has a particularly poor record on the missing value distribution. Instead of choosing a subset of classes that are best suited for the task, does it make sense to simply re-run the whole process with that class first? In this case, you run the same tests with different starting sets of classes: you find out which sets of classes produce the greatest error rates:\n\nIf you can do this",
    "As George Osborne announced that his \"golden rule\" that no amount of borrowing on the government's balance sheet should be more than 3pc of GDP has now reduced Britain's debt-to-GDP ratio to less than 80pc, economists and political economists noted that it was more than one quarter of the historic high reached back in the 1980s. It marked the first time that Britain has not had a debt-to-GDP ratio above 90pc since the end of the Second World War, when debt peaked at 126pc of GDP. \"This is good news – but it is only a fraction of the overall benefits to UK growth\" said Mark Blyth, head of UK economics at Capital Economics. \"More importantly, it also proves that the government can do much better than the 3pc rule if it pursues targeted policies without stifling growth.\"\n\nThe problem with this piece of economic advice is that the Golden Rule has never made much sense to economists. The 3pc rule is based on the idea that the government would spend more money that it takes in than the net interest paid on government debt to a manageable level.\n\nOf course, the debt to GDP ratio would rise if the government spent more money than it took in. That would lead to the government borrowing a bit more. It's the equivalent of making the debt to GDP in a country the size of the UK a bit higher than it actually is. Or alternatively, to have a higher debt to GDP and not a high tax rate.\n\nThat is not how people think about the economy: when you get the debt-to-GDP ratio above 10pc that's bad. And if you get it to 20pc or above the debt will cause you problems. That's why the US has a debt-to-GDP ratio above 30pc and its spending has never been higher than the tax take. Of course, the politicians who say there is a 3pc rule would be right to make that point to their voters.\n\nThe argument that there is a 3pc rule as we see it for economic policy is that some economists think it is the best way to measure the success of government stimulus (such as that from low interest rates) and in an economy as large as the UK, it is also a way to do fiscal policy.\n\nIt says to the politicians that, if they continue to spend way",
    "Abstract\n\nRecent years have seen a variety of systems developing for learning task-specific clustering algorithms. The most popular of these, CART, is inspired based on an inspired algorithm for clustering. Recently, there has been some research into other methodologies for inspired algorithms, as well as a proposed quorum-sensing inspired clustering algorithm called Quicksort. Quicksort uses a quorum model similar to that used in CART. In this study, we investigate various algorithms for clustering, and demonstrate that their performance is not highly influenced by the algorithms. Based on computational results, we also explain the underlying principles behind their different approaches. We present a novel computational implementation of Quicksort.\n\nWe also examine a number of the algorithms that are found in these systems and show that our methodology has reduced uncertainty in their performance. We also show that the results that can be achieved by our method are also attainable by other computational algorithms that utilize a quorum model.\n\nHere we define quorum as: For any set S = {k 1, …, k S } where k is the number of nodes in the set then A is a quorum if and only if E(k) is a quorum.\n\nTo understand the quorum, we first need to have an intuitive understanding of why a set of nodes can be considered a quorum. In a system of random nodes in a certain size interval [0,1], and each node has an infinite number of \"real\" connections (i.e. connections between any two nodes), a quorum is generated each time a node is chosen to connect to another node, by the algorithm that returns a true/false count. When choosing to connect two adjacent nodes, that number of connections is simply the total number of nodes in the larger interval, which is itself a quorum.\n\nA \"real\" connection consists of a node's neighbors and their corresponding links, such as node S1 connecting with node S4, and node S3 connecting with node C3. As a \"real\" link is real in both the \"connections\" and nodes themselves, each one is a quorum, and they are connected in such a way that they form a quorum when used as an algorithm to calculate a weighted average. Therefore, when using these algorithms",

I'm not here to validate the experiences of people who've used these methods to make their lives a little harder. I am here rather to describe the kind of person I find in myself…\n\nThe kind of person that can turn a disagreement into a personal attack, or can accuse you of hurting their feelings because you didn't call them out in a constructive manner. Or maybe that person had a bad day at work, but instead of dealing with it calmly, or dealing with it constructively, they decided to use it as an opportunity to express their own anger. They felt their personal grievances so strongly, so they lashed out, for no apparent reason, at someone else… who happened to be in the room the whole time.\n\nI have been in this situation a ton (this was my first time). You feel violated, and you don't know why you were ever bullied by this person in the first place. Or maybe you did. Maybe you deserved it. There are no absolutes here, there is only an absence of answers, or at worst, some kind of denial.\n\nAny answer that is given to a person like that is almost always a cop-out or an answer that they want. A \"It's not that bad\" because they think that because they didn't know their friend, all the bullying wasn't that bad. There is no way to know for certain.

It's different because you can't rely on anyone else to support you. It's different because no other adult was there to hold your hand and tell you it will get better. It's different because, like me, it sometimes feels like the only person you can count on are yourself.\n\nHow you decide to deal with this situation, and what direction you take, is entirely up to you.",
    "People are getting a bit defensive when there are \"alternative\" approaches to treating scar tissue.\n\nThis page is primarily targeted at women and girls, and this is a topic that affects both genders in varying ways. There are many \"treatment\" methods for scarring such as skin bleaching, laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion, and much more. I will explain some of the differences between treatments from the perspective of a teenage girl and young adult.\n\nHow to Use This Information\n\nFor a 17 year old girl, scarring is probably the most common problem with hair. It is also one of the most easily overlooked and most uncomfortable aspects of growing a long, sleek, beautiful, and healthy head of hair.\n\nYou'll be surprised how many teen girls do not know how to avoid scarring (the same goes for shaving). You may also learn something you didn't know before, such as whether a specific method of scarring is a permanent solution.\n\nScarring is definitely the most obvious problem when it happens, not a good idea to overlook it. If you notice that you constantly catch on fire and can't find the match, it may be time to consider scar removal.\n\n\nThis post gives the following advice. Please consider carefully before deciding on your treatment:\n\nWhat do I wear?\n\nYou should wear a conservative style until you are older and more confident.\n\nOnce you break the 5th percentile for facial stubble, the majority of girls start to feel pain.\n\nYou'll want to be comfortable with your hair, no matter what you do.\n\nYou should also understand this fact:\n\nIf you have hair on your face and the scar is on the inside of your mouth or ear, any treatments are far superior.\n\nIs There A Cure?\n\nNo. You can't expect to wear hats and avoid taking aspirin every day to stop the bleeding, so do the best you can.\n\nYou can still get a tattoo or put on a piercings, but you can leave the scars alone.\n\nThe only thing that will get a scar removed is someone talking to you—usually a close relative who has an interest in what's going on with you. That's about it. You could go for plastic surgery to cover it, like cosmetic surgery, but chances are you won't make your family",

    "\"A series of recent articles in a popular Chinese news magazine, 《The Globalist》, in which a \"reporter from abroad\" describes the current situation in mainland China more favorably than the United States government itself has done. This seems to be due to Chinese authorities being very conscious of the fact that any U.S. government news channel broadcasting the news \"too critically\" of China, would have the potential to bring the U.S. government and its officials into \"controversy\". The article written by a New York Times correspondent has caused a few journalists in China to think twice before publishing anything critical of their own government, so here are some of their thoughts.\n\nOn the first page of the magazine is a photograph of a row of large construction projects underway in Beijing, and on the second page is a column on the upcoming Olympics and the problems they will cause.

In practice, this is rarely the case. In this paper we prove many of the most commonly discussed laws of thermodynamics for highly complicated systems, even those that are theoretically independent. One of the most surprising results is that thermodynamic constraints such as phase transitions are not necessary, and can be disregarded entirely to produce a fully general physical theory of self-sustained detonations. The same theoretical results hold even if the targets of these explosions are not physically independent. These results have the advantage of showing that even if these attacks do not reach the target directly, the results are still significant. The theoretical results also show that even when the weapons are aimed at an arbitrary body, such as the ground, it is entirely possible to calculate the physical effects of the warhead, using only a finite amount of resources.\n\nAs a starting point for the theoretical models in this paper we can ask the question: What is feasible and what is impossible under these assumptions?\n\nThis paper introduces the concepts of weakly nonlinear systems, or systems whose self-similarity behavior is not linear, and shows how this simple but nonlinear system can be turned into a self-contained, full fledged thermodynamic system. Furthermore, we are able to use this theory for modeling self-sustained detonations of nuclear weapons.\n\nWith this paper we have shown that a self-contained partial differential equation describing the detonation sequence is consistent and predicts the detonation from the detonation sequences of multiple, self-contained nuclear explosions. We have solved a large number of problems in partial differential equations and in condensed matter physics, and our theoretical results are remarkably useful.\n\nWe suggest that the next few years will prove to be very important. The current theories of the nuclear sciences are still in their infancy and, while there have been a fair number of theoretical breakthroughs in the field, many of them are still theoretical",

    "The Blues forward will bring his experience at the highest level to the midfield for Cardiff where he will provide the power and penetration from the left that his manager believes is a must for the club to succeed\n\nRobinson has already shown that he is not afraid to take challenges and is an exciting and energetic player that offers the ability to create chances. This type of player is something that Pardew feels will complement his game well, as he is a player that not only gives the Blues the option of playing with a 4-5-1, but also makes sure he is an effective option in attack when required.\n\nThe 24-year-old has been with the Blues since the age of 15 and has since gone on to make a name for himself by scoring over 90 goals from the penalty spot since making his debut in December 2010. He also won the Young Player of the Year award at the end of last season.\n\nWe think that Robbie will only strengthen the squad next season so we can expect him to be part of the squad when the new fixture list is announced this coming Monday.",
    "Let's all get comfortable with changing names in our daily lives. We want to start naming our friends and family the first two letters of our first names. We want people to use our new names and don't care if they've never heard of us before. Just use the name we want to use and change the middle name. I bet anyone in the entire world would feel weird that way.\n\nI know that sounds ridiculous. Here's a couple more reasons why:\n\n–It's pretty simple — people are used to hearing one name. One name is so widely shared that when you name yourself something that's not a regular name (like \"Ivan\") there's a heightened sense of disconnect between the person having that name and his or her actual identity.\n\n–You can feel it. You get uncomfortable a lot when people start changing their names. It feels more like you're being forced to adopt a new role, to \"pass\" as something else. But if you choose a name that's been given to a person, and then that person names himself or herself after that first name, I think you'll feel pretty comfortable.",

    "\" This paper investigates the effects of a shared-memory switch (SMS) policy designed to reduce the performance penalty of a system on shared-memory writes and to allow a high level of latency. We use a wide variety of measurements (read, write, cache utilization, and the time to first seek) to characterize the performance of different systems based on either a SMS policy or a plain single-mode scheduler. The results show that an SMS policy for shared-memory switches is competitive on performance, latency, and I/O, as well as consistent across different kinds of storage, but is not always competitive on latency and bandwidth. This is primarily because of a high degree of competition with respect to the amount of RAM available. In particular, the performance of a storage-intensive system (with 256 MB and above) is generally competitive despite the memory allocation being restricted to 50 percent. But for low-Memory devices and storage-light systems, there is not much competition at all and the performance penalty is very high since the system is not allowed to write many blocks. This implies that the SMS policy imposes a high write I/O cost in order to maintain good latency. We show that the performance of a system using the SMS strategy is improved when each unit of memory is allocated independently of shared memory to achieve a higher I/O bandwidth and lower latency; however, this improves performance is not sufficient to compensate for the reduced latency due to the reduced overall memory throughput for that unit.\" \"SMS\" denotes shared memory. \"SMS\" is an acronym for \"Shared Memory Switched\".

    "It should be noted that Centurylink also has a \"walled garden\" internet plan which uses Google's (and possibly Sonic's) high speed internet only. That isn't quite the same thing, but is pretty similar from the fact that Centurylink offers high-speed internet to a select group of customers. If Centurylink offers Google's or Sonic's \"garden\" internet to all of their customers, they would end up getting very little in terms of internet revenue, and thus would either be paying more for bandwidth, or would not even be able to use their internet at all.\n\nIt would be no shock to me if they have a similar \"garden\" plan with Giganews because that's essentially what Google Fiber, though it is a bit more expensive, provides to its residential customers. While it is possible that Centurylink, or any other internet provider, may not want Google Fiber or similar services to spread to their customers, it is also still in the interest of their customers and their shareholders to have them. So, it's possible that they'd just have Google Fiber available in select areas like metro Dallas that they haven't \"garden\" access to, and will end up getting just the same kind of business that they receive now, but more subscribers.\n\nA CenturyLink spokesperson declined to comment.",
    "We present a novel image processing and detection method based on neural networks which can be used to classify the edges in a picture efficiently. Our approach provides the following benefits: (a) a highly efficient approach in capturing the edges, including all the pixels that are not touching the background; (b) an algorithm that is simple and easy to implement and operate; and (c) very high accuracy.\n\n\nOur approach relies on a highly accurate neural network trained to classify edges in a scene by exploiting its feature correlation function. This is done with the use of a combination of convolution and annealing techniques from deep image processing. It achieves a state-of-the-art performance for edge detection in a picture with an image size of 32×32 pixels. Based on our method a picture of 6×6 pixels or 4×4 pixels can be efficiently detected with a mere 16 lines of convolution, and it may be done in less than a second. In case of both the size of the picture and low computation power image recognition for smaller pictures becomes rather difficult.\n\n\nOur approach uses the neural network parameters from two commonly used approaches in object detection: the standard and the deep convolutional neural network. In both they consider the image as a function of feature values and a small amount of additional information added to detect edges in the pictures. Thus the neural network provides a highly accurate method in classification, and we propose an algorithm that takes advantage of this accuracy.",

    "We're left with the sad aftermath of a hero that was so deeply flawed that, to the outside world, it was impossible for anyone to really appreciate his greatness. The most damning thing about Batman v Superman is the fact that the same flaws that make Zack Snyder's adaptation so flawed – like its reliance on violence as a storytelling device – are the same flaws that allowed us to love Zack Snyder and Batman v Superman.\n\nWhile Batman v Superman made some huge leaps forward with the portrayal of a character so many people could relate to, it's hard to reconcile why this film could exist at all when its core character is the same one that made so so many people cry at the end of \"Batman v Superman.\"\n\nWhile \"Batman v Superman\" is definitely not a \"worst of\" list, it's still important to note how this series managed to earn such a passionate fan base at the end of all of its bad performances: It was a comic book superhero that was made to actually resonate with real-life people. Zack Snyder and his team of writers, cast, cinematographers and producers created a superhero who truly did get real people.\n\nThe bad guys are as bad as you say\n\nDespite the fact that one of the most important things a movie needs to accomplish is to make sure it's not a \"bad movie\" like \"Oz the Great and Powerful,\" the opposite is actually true. We know how bad \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" was because audiences were literally trying to avoid it for their entire lives, and yet audiences still seemed to react positively to the movie because it was fun. \"Batman v Superman\" got better as it progressed, but it didn't get better until \"Batman v Superman\" saw the light of day.\n\nSnyder chose not to take any chances or compromise with his narrative, and that meant that a lot of people wanted Batman v Superman to be a big commercial disappointment. Why did fans want it to fail so badly? For a lot obvious, but important reason that you can't ignore: Because DC movies aren't just movies anymore.\n\nIt's been a few decades since \"The Dark Knight Returns,\" and, over that time, films have become more and more like real world movies. Sure, we never have a chance to see an adult Chris Nolan movie or a high degree of realism in \"The Phantom Menace",
    "To the OP:\n\nLet's start with \"Bible-believing Christians\" here: if you're not Christian, I'd expect you to be saying \"no it doesn't\" in exactly the same way the atheists say \"no it doesn't\". If you're Christian, your belief is predicated on the assertion of the divinely-sanctioned author of the original text that God is the ultimate author of the English language. So if you're not actually religious, I would expect you to reject the view of a God who made the Bible, or at least recognize it as an imperfect and limited document.\n\nOn what basis is this belief the official policy of the Catholic church, which is a \"Christian\" organization and one of the largest denominations in the world? You can't say it's based on the Old and New Testaments, which the Catholic church says are inspired and authoritative and therefore divinely inspired, because the Catholic church and most of its adherents simply reject both the Old and New Testaments as \"infallible, infallible and inerrant\". So why assume to assert that God's words are infallible? If you reject the existence or divinity of an omnibenevolent, omniscient, omnipresent, infinitely loving, all-lauding, all-loving God, who speaks and speaks only in human language (in both senses of the term- he created the stars; he spoke into the first person of Adam that all who hear these words would be blessed with life; he spoke into Moses and said what God commanded to Moses; how can he not speak into the heart of man today to assure all of us that the works are good, the words spoken in His wisdom and goodness are eternal, that there is no reason not to believe in him and obey him if we know and believe the words by which he commanded us- why assume his intentions are infallible? Why take for granted something we have no valid reason to assume, given that there were thousands of Christians and numerous other religious groups (not to mention other faiths and philosophies), all of which have differing beliefs and reasons for rejecting the notion of a human omniscient, omnipresent and loving deity, one who speaks only in human language, as opposed to a divinely-inspired, all-lauding, all-loving deity with His own omniscient, omnipresent and loving thoughts",
    "The following text is an excerpt of a long comment thread that's currently the best source of information about the new girl in the White House.\n\nI am not going to name her, not because I have no idea who she is, but because the White House has a policy that forbids them from releasing the names of confidential sources. The reason for the policy is based on three considerations. First, it's a waste of time and resources for an administration of questionable ethics and competence to publicly embarrass people who are willing to go to great lengths to inform them of potential wrongdoing. Second, it encourages more leakers, and third, it gives the people who can do the most damage to the administration the greatest platform. If White House employees are not going to come forward without some kind of motivation other than not being embarrassed to have their name associated with the president's decisions, then they're not going to be willing to do it. And when it's time to prosecute someone for leak-related crimes, the most powerful people in the country will always be able to point at that person and say, \"look at him; he was the source!\" That makes prosecution even harder. Finally, it prevents the administration from actually holding anyone accountable for committing possible criminal acts. All of this is important to this discussion of the new intern in the White House. I haven't actually sat down to edit the comments so these are probably all fairly accurate, but I'm sure there are a few that look a bit out-of-place.\n\nI am going to take out a few paragraphs, in part to highlight specific quotes because some of you may read the full thread in a hurry. In other words, some of this can be really long.

    "Hi. I'm 13 years old. My dad and I split our time equally. He works a full-time job that pays him in the high 40s, and me in the high 20s. I spend some nights off with him and I spend the others at his house. I want to do my homework by myself, and I want to be paid for my work. This is where my father comes in. When I said I want to work, he thought I was messing with him, but I told him that I work a full-time job and, if I wanted to get a full-time job later on in life, I'm going to have to work while at my dad's house.\n\nWhen he found out I wanted to work, he said \"Okay, I'll let you do your homework at my house\". I agreed, but only if he let me do it in his room, with his own computer to study on. I wanted to learn how things work, so I asked how much money it would take to buy things like books, school supplies, or computers, and to see if it would take them a full week to get the supplies for me. He says $30 a week. Here's the stuff he's bought for me: • Two laptops (I love my Macbook Pro), and two iPads • iPad, computer, and printer, I got the iPad 2 when it came out. • A textbook • Smart-Shoe charger ($3.99) • Headphones (they're great, but we have a big family of four, and my dad can't wear them). The headphones don't block out the sound of my TV/computer/tablet/phones and I can hear my mom and my uncle all too well as you can see in the pictures. I got them over a year ago - it's been a couple years since my first year at high school, and I'm not ready for them to be worn out.\n\nI was very clear before signing up, that if I wanted to work, I was going to have to work. Also, while it would make me money, I was thinking about whether or not I still wanted to go to high school. I have a high opinion of my dad and I can talk to him about that, but it hasn't made it into my plans yet.",
    "I went to check on my shrimps at lunch today and was horrified to see that all four of them had fallen ill. Each of my 3 shrimp had lost all of the fins and the only thing left of that big orange body was a single tail. I grabbed 1 of them and placed it under my microscope to see if it was still alive and as I lifted it to check (still there! WOO!), the remaining shrimp that it was attached to started convulsing and then fell to its death. I just felt awful for those poor guys. I'll go buy some more shrimp soon, when they're in good enough shape to eat, I just need to feed myself. I also want to post about the other shrimp we bought… my mamma's shrimp started collapsing in her tank the other day, and she's afraid that it might have \"poisoned\" my bachelors. I'm afraid it could as well. :( Any advice?\n\nDear \"shrimp keeper\": I'm sorry to hear about your shrimp woes. I can tell you that the two other shrimp are very healthy, as have all the shrimp imported from Japan. If you wish to do a partial tank-cleaning test with your bachelors, you can do so before eating.\n\nIt is not unusual for large groups of pet shrimp to succumb to bacterial illnesses such as the ones currently afflicting your shrimp. This happens occasionally, even in the best-laid plans. Even a little bit of shrimp that died was likely to have infected the tank, though. Your only hope is to remove as much of the tank as possible so that your healthy shrimp can regain their health. In the case of your shrimp, I would recommend removing as much water from the tank as possible to allow the shrimp to dry out, and then remove your shrimp as soon as possible so that they can feed.\n\nHow to Clean Your Shrimp Tank\n\nWhen cleaning out a shrimp tank, you may find yourself tempted to remove everything you can see before cleaning, but this may result in keeping the tank more stagnant than it needs to be, and could result in the death of any living creatures before you start removing the dead and dying cells. The best solution is to keep everything in its proper place and then do as little water treatment as possible.\n\nThere are a few rules to keep in mind:",

    "Here is one of the most powerful images I have ever seen in any fantasy story. We have seen it in this fantasy novel of ours, and perhaps it also plays an important part of our tale. A man was born without eyes. In the beginning of life, he saw in an obscure way. In time, however, he was able to distinguish more and more of the world around him. He had an inner eye, a second, more powerful eye, at the same level as his outer eye. When he opened his third eye, he saw the future, and all that would happen in accordance to the events of the past. Because he had learned all of this, he could see into the future and predict the events he would witness. This power of foresight made him a knight. He was able to keep track of the entire world and take all the actions necessary to save others. It made him dangerous to the kingdom, however, which wanted to silence him. However, the king of the land, who was also his mentor, had a hidden skill that was also at the level of a knight… a weapon that could open the future and change the future. A weapon that could change the future… a weapon that made possible the advent of an heir… Kakine the Third, who would lead a newly unified kingdom, was a man who had all the power that would allow him to achieve his ambitions. He went into hiding, in order to study the most powerful magical artifact that would allow him to travel between worlds. And through experiments he learned how to open the future and change the future. Through the magic scroll of a great knight, he was able to understand the art of \"timestop\". The spell needed a time-turned tome which could be retrieved from a \"timestop pedestal\" which is placed somewhere in the land of the future. He had this tome delivered to him, and the moment it touched the time-turned tome, the scroll turned to dust and disappeared in a flash. The moment was a miracle in the eyes of Kakine the Third. After that, he could predict the future by touching the tome of another person. By touching, he could see their thoughts, what they needed, what actions they would take… it was as though a magician had taken over their body, like a magic spell. But there was more to the to",

    "\"In all of the Star Wars movies, there aren't many moments of horror that are as unforgettable as the scene that takes place in this movie, because it's a great example of what really scary horror is all about. The scenes of the movie can be used to scare you, to move you to action, to fill up your head with fear, but the most important reason is that one of the most recognizable moments in the entire franchise has been used, and really, without it, the movies never could have become what they are today. The scenes that occur in this film are great to look at, with a lot of blood and gore, but the main reason that people love the movie so much is because of the special effects. We've talked about the fact that these effects are not the best possible looking ones, and that it does not make up for that fact, but what is missing, and what makes the movie so creepy, is that it actually is a special effects based movie. This movie didn't have to be based on a special effects movie. This movie could have had an action based story, but it could have been a great horror movie and still have stayed true to special effect, so people could still empathize with it. This is the special effects that makes this movie so damn unique and what you get is horror, pure and simple. If you don't like it, you need to look at a different movie. If you like it - great.\"",

Well, I did anyway. However, IMDb are all of a sudden becoming very interested in the sort of reviews they publish and this is because of the recent success with the \"The Disaster Artist,\" a movie which made over half a billion dollars worldwide, won best picture at the Oscars (I know, it makes me so happy) and was the highest grossing independent film of 2016 with an estimated gross of nearly a billion dollars. The reason for the sudden interest is because of the IMDb's announcement that an unprecedented amount of complaints were filed against the \"The Disaster Artist\" after it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and also because of a complaint by the actor Paul Dano, who had been attacked by a female reviewer. But to understand why the complaints were made there is no need to look further, because both Dano and IMDb make things very clear: both are men, and they have, at least in the minds of the author of the letter directed to IMDb. Well, IMDb have responded to the controversy with a new statement.\n\n\"IMDb's review policy and guidelines state that reviews involving sexual violence, abuse of power, or discrimination of any sort are not permitted. This is because our purpose is to provide information and entertainment, and we have always believed that our reviews should be a safe, supportive environment for our guests. Sexual violence in the movie 'The Disaster Artist' does not meet these criteria, therefore therefore the review was inappropriate.\"\n\nYou really have to go and read the whole of the statement, but in summary it basically says that it's not the reviewers fault that things are presented in a biased and unbalanced manner and that the movie failed to meet the criteria for a sexual violence and abuse of power review. For those of you that don't know what reviews are all about and how they work, it is a method where",
    "When I finally watched it I had to admit that \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" is as good as any Hollywood film I saw this year and, in my mind at least, as good as any movie ever. It's a romantic drama, set in present day London and starring the great Liam Neeson as James Milner, the father of the protagonist, Peter Milner, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. You can probably guess from the title that it's a fairly serious affair. It's also, as you'd expect, very funny. This film has some of my favorite moments in recent years. Cumberbatch has a few, particularly when he's getting to know his new lover (played by Felicity Jones) and he's trying to make sense of his broken relationship with his father. When James has the chance to speak to one of his favorite artists, he decides to pay his respects to Richard E. Grant (who plays Grant's mother). It wasn't a completely seamless transition from British to American culture, but it was well done. But, you know, if you want to know how it goes, just keep reading.\n\n\"Good Night, and Good Luck\" is another example of the strong American influence on British culture. Much of it was based off our culture, but the film also had some scenes borrowed from Italian films, including \"Al Capone\" and \"The Godfather\" as well.\n\nThe movie is also in part based upon the work \"The Wasp Factory,\" which is an art house movie about a couple whose lives are so completely consumed by the art they love that it leads them into a world of ruin.\n\nHowever, I still can't put my finger on what exactly makes the film feel like a quintessential American movie; apart from the music and the romance, of course. The British setting is really what made me feel a part was here and not in Italy.\n\nThe movie is a film about love, but it's not very romantic in the least. In fact, it has too many moments where the characters just fall out of love rather than fall in love. But, that's not why I'm on the fence about this film. I don't want it to be the greatest romantic movie ever made; I want it to be good. I wanted it to be \"Casablanca\" but without the \"Sieg",
    "\"Our main idea in this paper is about the efficient evaluation of a compact version of product or product space. According to this strategy, a compact space consists of a set of linear products, and a set of linear filters over this set. Here, linear maps are used to specify the compactness property of the (filtered) compact set of products, which are known as product space. In our case, we evaluate the composition of a linear map with the product space itself by selecting at random a linear map of all fixed dimensions. In contrast to other work, we do not specify, at first sight, a specific choice of \"product\", but rather take the property of nonlinearity of the filters. Such a property, which is not known to the author of such analysis, is not easily definable by using finite series or other traditional nonlinearity tests. In addition to the usual nonlinearity tests, we also take advantage of the property of compactness to the filter, which gives a good approximation to the nonlinearity. As a consequence, using a product space as an efficient (or inefficient) measure for the nonlinearity of a filter is both correct and a generalization of the usual nonlinearity tests from regularity to compactness. Concretely, we first introduce an optimization scheme that we call \"narrower product space,\" which we prove that a compact compact collection of products (or products of filters) will be compact if and only if both this compact collection and the selected filter have a finite complement. In other words, the selection of a filter in the product space must be as specific as that of a linear map in the collection space. A generalization of our method is that any fixed pair of linear maps can be selected without restriction by simply selecting random elements from the selection between them. Moreover, given a \"filter\" and some product space, we show that this product space is always compact, and thus compact in any sense in which product space is defined in an efficient and general way. \"\n\n\nHere is an animation of our proof in practice:",

    "While I loved \"Shrek Forever After\" there are a number of minor problems with the film that detract from its overall quality of storytelling and acting. The movie's story is not only disjointed, but is also lacking in any kind of focus. It's clear the writers and director were more concerned about making an entertaining and funny movie and not trying to fully tell a story in the form of a traditional story arc. You see, we are told almost nothing about the background of our main character: The Duke of Deception. That's because he was born and raised in his family's magical forest known as The Evergreen Forest. Our hero comes to Decepticon HQ only by chance; he has been lured away by the princess of these woods, Princess Fiona. The only problem is that he doesn't know what he's doing and, as a result, he ends up doing more harm than good to Fiona and her kingdom.\n\nWe also never get any depth, development, or understanding into The Duke himself and why he does what he does. The only thing we really learn is that his father, who is a terrible man who doesn't want the Duke anywhere near his family, raised him to always follow the rules. It's made pretty obvious from the beginning that The Duke is not an intelligent man and we rarely do get the sense he makes good decisions with regards to what he does. On top of that, we never really get to know The Duke (with the exception of his brother Decepticon Lord, a far better character) like we would in a movie with some development for each character in the narrative. It's as if these two characters were only there to serve as story props to the overall plot, as if the film was afraid to actually tell a complete story and instead was instead trying to fill it with one giant joke!\n\nDespite those problems, the movie is still entertaining to see with excellent performances on the part of the cast and it's easily entertaining to watch. Those who may have had a hard time with the film in the previous reviews will find no problems with this one, however. I'll admit that the movie is flawed and the plot is a mess with numerous plot holes and subplot points that could've been made clearer and some dialogue that could've been better. However, I do enjoy this movie and will find lots of amusement in seeing The Duke do his things.",

    "Abstract Hilbert von Neumann modularization is the process of constructing a formal language in which a large amount of individual programs are embedded in a small number of mutually non-intersecting modules. The von Neumann Modules model is commonly used as a starting point for implementing concurrent programs. However, constructing small languages in which to implement concurrent programs is still a significant challenge in the area of concurrent programming. The purpose of this work is to construct a large formal language containing a large number of simple von Neumann modules to enable concrete parallel programs to be implemented with a simple set of standard library methods. The large module language can thereby be employed as a toolbox for the design and implementation of large concurrent programs. The result is a large set of modules for which existing parallel computing systems are not applicable. The proposed large module language has the following features: The modular facilities for programming a modular language are well developed and well tested. The current modules are well designed for parallel computation. The most important modules, however, are implemented in several different ways. It is not required to learn any new languages in order to obtain the full benefits of the large module language.\n\nConcept\n\nThe von Neumann Modules (VNM) construct was developed by von Neumann in the 1930s as a simple model of modular organization. Although very simple for now, when implemented in computer language, the VNM architecture has a number of interesting properties and has been widely used in computer science and programming languages. In this paper we show that it is possible to construct large von Neumann modules in an efficient and modular manner using a very simple set of standard library methods. By exploiting the parallelizable property we construct a large module language with well structured data types and programming modules. The result is a language for which typical programs that take 10 days or more to execute today can be written in a matter of hours.\n\nThe Large Modular Consecutive-time Algorithm: The LMC Algorithm\n\nBefore we begin, we wish to introduce some terminology for our ideas. We will refer to our VNM language as LMC, or the Large Modular Consecutive-Time Algorithm, with only a brief introduction into its definition. The language LMC does not provide any direct access to real-world data structures other than simple variables.",

    "I know that many of you girls out there wear some form of make up on a weekly basis (although it often looks more like my \"hair mask\" than a full-time disguise). But is it ok to just grow it out of my head or what? I'm not a beauty blogger by any stretch, but I feel as though there are so many great, unique, and creative things being done with hair and my beauty regimen.\n\nI'm a 20 year old, male student who is studying fashion and design. I want to look nice and stylish when I wear a suit, and I also want to look natural (in a good way, of course). I have seen many articles in the fashion magazines, and also my girlfriends who have long hair, how they look with the most outlandish and outlandish hair styles I can think of. They would always have the same thing on their heads — some kind of extensions or some sort of hair-removal gel or something on top of it — and I always loved it. Not necessarily because I think it is cool or fashionable or even pretty but that's the beauty of it. And yes, if you are into \"suck it\" and \"twist it\" you too can wear it too. For me it's all about letting my hair breathe — so I don't have to pull out the hair I find most interesting to see what happens to it.\n\nAll my ideas of what I want to see (in my hair) come from a place of \"let it grow out, it will look good\" rather than \"I have to have it this way with the rest of my hair.\" I also don't feel like I have to look perfect or be super feminine in every way just to wear a nice suit or cute dress (that I have no interest in!). I believe that if I'm able to look good in a pretty dress, my hair will find it's own unique balance. At least that's what I think. Just wondering if any of you are thinking along the same lines.\n\nAs for me! Well first of all, I'm very happy with my current hairstyle, although I am very sad to have it go! I have only been using it for about a month and I feel like the extensions have started giving me weird little lumps down the sides and the hair is sort of just hanging here and there. I also",
    "In this paper, we review the history and syntax of GNU epsilon as derived from the source language Ada. We show that an extensible functional programming language can be implemented and verified via formal proof techniques. We demonstrate how these proofs can be used to define formal semantics and implement the compiler, and how they provide a basis for automated software verification.\n\nI wanted to ask him how well the Ada port could verify the correctness of C code. I expected him to comment on a blog post about an alternative to Ada. But he didn't, and instead, he left us with this paragraph, which I want you to read closely:\n\nGNU epsilon can be implemented using the formal proof techniques of the Ada language, but it is an extensible programming language. This means that it can be extended in an extensible way to support new types, different representations, and more abstract semantics for programming. We have developed a fully implemented system that is similar to Ada and has been verified at ISO/IEC standards level and beyond. We have presented our results at a high level and in a way that is approachable by non-experts. These results are important for making it possible to port existing and future software applications to GNU epsilon.\n\nHere's the article with the quotation from Andrew.",
    "Unilever is planning a major change within its consumer products business, in a move that could see it sell off or sell off its brands. The company has received several takeover suggestions from several hedge funds, but according to the Financial Times, it is now likely to sell. The business had $18.1bn of net profit last year, while sales came up 11% at $5.6bn. It has faced a range of criticism this year under new CEO Kevin Johnson for failing to cut operating costs. Meanwhile, it was caught using cheap-labour sourcing, which it says is not common in its industry. The company, which is owned by Cadbury, will make the announcement at a shareholder meeting in New York on October 15. Unilever has resisted pressure from US consumer group US Uncut to do something about its \"low-cost labour\" but has a lot of financial leverage, so might have little choice.\n\nLet me pause here and acknowledge some confusion here. Unilever is not going to sell brands in its consumer products business? Why? How is that going to work out?\n\nThe answer comes straight from an expert source and from a company official:\n\n\"I am not suggesting Unilever will start selling its consumer brands to private equity firms,\" a spokeswoman said. \"But Unilever has done its best to control costs and has cut labour costs.\"\n\nUnilever, which has recently announced it was increasing the size of its existing £1.2bn capital expansion fund, is also being forced to cut its capital expenditure to save about 30% of its production costs from next year, she said.\n\n(By way of background I'll refer to Unilever as the \"Unilever Group\" or \"the Unilever Group\". That is due to a misprint. As a company it has been renamed to remove any suggestion of ownership or investment. It also has many different types of divisions including consumer businesses and international businesses. Most of those divisions have been absorbed into Unilever's consumer business.)\n\nUnilever has also reported a 2.2% drop in quarterly profits to £13.4m, compared with a 19.7% increase to sales of £5.6bn.\n\nSo it is a matter of economics. Unilever can't keep raising prices. It has no",
    "An adaptation of the Marvel comic \"Invincible,\" the story is set at a high school in a state of constant change, one in which an extraordinary student faces the challenge of balancing personal growth with the larger picture. As this seemingly ordinary young man becomes the hero of his own story, he is thrust into an adventure that is as big as the world is and yet as small as his mind.\n\nLeading man Ryan Reynolds is charming and handsome – yet a deep, dark and brooding sense of tragedy lurks behind his sunny, positive disposition. As he comes to terms with his powers – what he has become and how he has to cope with this unprecedented journey – Reynolds and the rest of the cast (including Emily Blunt, Jamie Bell and Morena Baccarin) create a moving and powerful story, that makes the audience feel the gravity of the situation that Reynolds finds himself in, but that rarely shows his vulnerability.\n\nIt has been an exciting year for Ryan Reynolds: He became the first actor to land the coveted role of Deadpool, and his recent leading role on film-dominating franchise The Green Lantern was the best of what the actor has done to date – both in his acting and with Green Lantern. This has all been combined with a stellar year in the studio system for the star – playing both Green Lantern (2013) and Kick-Ass (2012), his first big screen role as a leading man in two years.\n\nIn a year where he showed strong leadership as an actor, and as a producer with Deadpool, Reynolds is a star who continues to stand above the rest. He does this with the same strong leadership and leadership style he established before even coming into the industry, and continues to develop to this day.\n\nThe movie is a little light, but it is also the most action-packed of the recent action blockbusters that is now dominating the box office. The movie follows the story of Sam (Ryan Reynolds) as he battles an unknown enemy that was sent to his school. Ryan Reynolds in a major role.",
    "U.S. manufactures grew at the fastest pace for 21 months in September, but a surprise contraction in electricity production is raising questions about a recovery.\n\nUnexpected growth in electrical output, which includes power generation from coal-fired plants, has some analysts wondering whether the economy is ready for another surge in factory activity.\n\nA second fall in electricity output, which fell 0.9%. and which will weigh on growth in the third quarter, will slow the growth in industrial production which grew 2.4% during the three months ending September, slightly below expectations and the lowest pace since May 2009.\n\n\"The current level of growth is still sustainable, but what the economy needs is more electricity,\" said Brian Jacobsen, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities.\n\n\"I think this is yet one more indication that some economists are starting to worry,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank. \"There's been a real pick up in the electricity sector, it's been a major sector of the manufacturing [recovery], but today's numbers are a big letdown. I'm not sure all these factories are ready to crank up production like that.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether power outages will slow manufacturing output or cause it to slip. After all, many manufacturing facilities have backup power systems, and a downturn in the power business doesn't directly affect factories that use it.\n\nBut the outages have sent some manufacturing employees home for a day or more, raising questions about whether the current economic recovery is already showing signs of slowing.\n\n\"Today's data do demonstrate that it's a real possibility that the manufacturing recovery is running into trouble,\" said Neil Dutta, chief economist at Renaissance Capital Market.\n\nManufacturing output grew 0.2% in September, matching a four-year low.\n\n\"The biggest factor in the expansion in the first half of the year was consumers spending,\" said Mr. Dutta. \"One of the factors now is whether consumers and businesses are going to feel the effects of the downturn they've been going through.\"\n\nThis latest manufacturing contraction could give ammunition to critics — such as congressional Republicans — who cite high levels of unemployment in manufacturing districts in their push to slash income taxes.\n\n\"We're seeing some signs that the recovery is losing momentum,\" said Neil Dutta, chief",
    "Chirped light-matter waves in optical antiguides: non-diffracting light chirped and time-resolved measurements based on antiguide perturbation theory\n\nA research collaboration between Umeå University, Universidade de São Paulo, Université Libre de Bruxelles, and Graz University of Technology, has taken several steps toward a more robust and realistic model of the optical antiguide phenomenon. During the collaboration with Professor Guilherme da Rosa of the Department of Physics at Umeå University, the first and most fundamental result of this collaboration was obtained: the non-refraction effects of ultrashort laser pulses in optical antiguides, which are obtained by performing non-linear differential phases with pulse modulation.\n\nThe theoretical work now being performed by the collaboration involves the development of non-diffracting optical antiguide models in which chirped light and time-resolved photodetectors are employed. A series of theoretical calculations from the original collaboration of Professors Guilherme Da Rosa and Uwe Lecce of Umeå University and Professor David H. O'Neill of Umeå University have recently come back with predictions for chirped chirped bessel waves in optical antiguides. The observations obtained by the experimental team at Graz University of Technology now offer a clear proof of these predictions, which are in general agreement with the theoretical predictions.\n\nOne potential problem, which was identified in the theoretical calculations done by the collaboration during their joint work at Umeå University and Graz, was the possibility, which remained unexplained even after several investigations, that a non-parallel chirped beam with different chirp lengths could produce non-refraction effects. The researchers of this collaboration therefore set out to investigate how such a non-parallel beam could be produced, and have recently achieved a significant advance on this problem by observing light from an ultrashort laser pulse being refracted by a chirped light beam having different dimensions. The results they have obtained are as follows.\n\nThe direct observation: In order to produce the observed chirped interference of chirp lengths the researchers were able to detect the chirp duration in their optical",
    "Although this isn't a movie about an animal in the traditional sense of the word, I was surprised by how well the film's message of acceptance, kindness and acceptance of each other by humans is portrayed. I'm not really a sentimental movie fan, but I did feel a part of myself getting lost in this movie. The story about three polar bears searching for their mother while traveling on a sled is pretty sweet, but it ends abruptly when they are discovered by a woman who tells them to get back on, or they won't get food the next day. And then the polar bears start chasing the woman and trying to attack her. It's pretty funny because they really do believe they must help her, even though she won't listen to them.\n\nI don't usually go for movies inspired by music (or even documentaries inspired by music) but it took me a long time (about three years) to finally watch this movie. I finally got around to watching it because about a month ago, someone emailed me about it so I decided to put it on my watch list. On the other hand, I knew nothing about the story and I didn't really care because I did not find it boring.\n\nAfter listening to songs from the film (such as \"Goodbye Horses\") and looking at the posters from the film, I had this feeling of happiness after watching it. I felt like I had been transported to another world, but I was still surprised because, at the beginning of the movie, when the polar bears are on a sled for the first time, the narrator tells us that \"we've been here before. Many years ago, we learned to cope.\" It's really hard to explain what's so special about this movie. Perhaps it's due to the fact that the story is told from the perspective of the animals themselves. It's hard to summarize this movie without describing how beautiful and magical it was. The ending of the movie brought out a smile on my face and a tear in my eye. I don't know if I can describe it but, on top of that, I don't think I can describe it better than that.\n\nWhile this isn't an exact movie adaptation based on the book series, some similarities can be noticed. For example, you don't have to have read the books, but some of them can help you understand the movie better. It doesn't matter if you",
    "Jose Mourinho's future at Chelsea is hanging in the balance following a 'thorough investigation' into reported phone tapping of his players.\n\nThe Stamford Bridge outfit is believed to have received a tip off that their manager had been monitored by state intelligence agency GCHQ – possibly under the watchful eye of David Cameron. The Independent last night was given a description of how such an investigation can be carried out.\n\nIn plain English, the GCHQ operation would involve a listening device being placed inside Chelsea's dressing room. The device, the paper said, would allow the listening station to track activity in and around the club and then transmit that information back to the agency.\n\nBoris Johnson may also be implicated, the paper claimed, after it emerged he was at a party last year where phone numbers were being mentioned – including those of Mourinho and his senior players.\n\nIt is claimed that GCHQ was put into contact by the agents of David Cameron, who are understood to have told the agency they had information that should be passed on to authorities in an attempt to keep the manager in the UK.\n\nA source said: 'The head of MI5, Andrew Parker, has visited the UK to meet with officials and is very clear that as far as he is concerned, all that matters to MI5 is when it comes to terrorism, that the only people who really matter are intelligence officers.\n\n'Of course, MI5 and MI6 are very aware of the fact that if GCHQ wants to monitor, say, a football manager at a Premier League team, they will get that opportunity.'\n\nThe Independent understands that the meeting had been a failure, with GCHQ asking for assurances that the information was not in any way tied to the ongoing operation against senior members of the Libyan regime.\n\nBoris Johnson may also have been included in a GCHQ tracking operation on Mourinho, that took place last summer, it has been claimed\n\nIt is understood that the visit was a result of the inquiry which also took place at Manchester United when the Red Devils were monitored by GCHQ\n\nA spokesman for the Prime Minister would not comment on any specific case and was instead asked to provide a categorical denial to the allegations.\n\nA spokesman for GCHQ has refused to confirm or deny its work.\n\nAsked for a reaction to the claims, a spokesman for the Prime Minister",
    "\"Recently had a shitty haircut and I still can't figure it out. The hair is unkempt, with no volume, no definition, and a ridiculous amount of tangles. Maybe somebody told me to work my way to that look, maybe it is just terrible haircuts.\"\n\nAnd what if our collective confusion has nothing to do with quality? What if our own hair-tearing behavior creates a self-perpetuating cycle of stress and hair loss?\n\nAccording to University of Miami psychology researchers and members of the Hairloss Support Society (HSS), this self-perpetuating system is quite common.\n\n\"It's become more common for us to do things like tie ourselves up, put on the headphones, and ignore the haircuts or the conditioner,\" explains HSS member and professor Amy Nedergaard.\n\n\"We are doing these things that can directly have long-lasting consequences on our hair—that's what we're talking about when we talk about hair loss. We're doing these things to fix ourselves, to repair our heads we think are too damaged to be able to have hair.\"\n\nWhat do you think causes hair loss in particular—and in general—when it's a \"hair loss,\" but not \"hair loss,\" but not hair quality and so on? Does it have to do with anything in particular? Maybe your body already damaged itself.\n\n(More hair loss stories)",
    "More and more cities are trying to deal with congestion by introducing congestion charge or congestion pricing schemes. But they are faced with a catch – the congestion charge itself comes too late in the day. A recent study on London's congestion charging system has shown that it has had a significant impact on the number of vehicles on the roads because people don't pay until much more recently – and so the effect is a negative one: more congestion is caused. So what can cities do? At the moment, there are many models ranging from full price road pricing to simple traffic management techniques. And in China it could be the case that traffic congestion costs more than the actual amount drivers pay for their travel. This means that traffic congestion could pay for itself, and the cities could become wealthy from increasing revenue. The key issue is whether countries, cities, business and entrepreneurs will take part in this concept.\n\nChina is a developing country with many issues, most of which have nothing to do with cars. We can all dream of China becoming rich by making our roads and cities free from pollution and traffic.\n\nThe report from the University of York says:\n\nChina's model for \"road pricing\" takes advantage of two developments. First, the ability to monitor and control traffic flows via sensors as much as possible: not only to provide detailed information on traffic movements and patterns but also to generate new traffic-calming ideas and ways of thinking. Second, the opportunity to use information about the speed, size, location and composition of vehicles to predict congestion and traffic jams – without being the ultimate decision maker: drivers are responsible for their actions and the actions of other drivers are a secondary consequence.\n\nThe report says that the study of China's congestion pricing schemes shows the importance of traffic monitoring and planning to make traffic more efficient and avoid jams.\n\nFrom the University of York:\n\nAfter a single day, the impact of the road pricing system on total travel time was about two hour's delay on average, with about 1.7% reduction in traffic volumes. However, on the first day, we found an overshoot of the reduction, so the overall effect of the traffic pricing was not significant. During this study, it was not possible to measure the additional effect of road pricing due to changes in motor vehicle use patterns, but we note that the increased use of public transport may affect driving behaviour and travel time.

    "One word to describe this movie is \"bitter\". The film follows teen Hazel Grace Lancaster ('s Keira Knightley), as she falls in an abusive romantic relationship, falls ill, is rejected by her teachers and is expelled from her high school.\n\nHazel and her friends are in the first grade and get into a fight and it is revealed that Hazel is in fact the child of Mr. and Mrs. Edens whose divorce happened over her smoking pot in their garage. To top it all, Hazel is left by the family who she's left behind in New York and her best friend Margo (Isla Fisher) thinks that it is because she was mean to Hazel. Hazel is then put into a private Catholic convent and she has to live in the church with a strange monk named Father Callas and they have a series of misunderstandings that leads to Hazel's expulsion from the convent. Hazel also has to work through her feelings of rejection and guilt. She is offered the opportunity to leave the convent one last time by a man named Jeff (John Lithgow) who is also her mentor in the school, but she rejects because of her belief that her parents would reject her too.\n\nThe film is very much a coming-of-age tale about how Hazel's life develops and what she learns along the way. The movie manages to get some things right: the relationship between the Edens family and Hazel; the tension between boys and girls; the way religious people handle their affairs.\n\nThere are, however, some things that are a little too perfect to be taken literally. The movie is a love story, yes, but it is also a tale of what happens when children come of age in a world that is often too harsh; it should be said up front, however, that this is a great movie!\n\n\"The Fault in Our Stars\" is not really as successful as it is described in the ad copy. IMDb.com states that \"for fans of : 'The Hunger Games,' 'The Fault in Our Stars,' 'Her,', and 'Thelma & Louise,' \" while it is, in fact, \"An intelligent and well-crafted coming-of-age drama.\" And, indeed, some aspects of this film are very much influenced by these other two movies.

    "It should go without saying that anything that a man tries to pass off as a 'nice thing' or 'nice thing' which isn't actually so is automatically the result of his being a self-involved shitlord who has a severe lack of standards, who puts himself first and has no self-awareness.\n\nSo, the post goes on to describe, in detail, exactly how the man's behavior was not \"nice\", and how this caused her to become sickened by it.\n\nYou can be sure that when the victim in this situation saw the comments (which weren't censored or deleted), her first impulse was to report them, and that it was the main reason she came to see reddit.\n\nI'm not even going to bother asking how a community with over 50 million users can tolerate these types of comments when the same people have the power to completely purge these sorts of things out from the site - one of the most popular in the world and that has one of the largest audiences on the internet.\n\nThere's nothing more offensive and disgusting than when people make excuses for how they have treated people, and instead of looking it straight in the eye, try to put their own spin on it.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nSo here was one of the most popular'reddits' in the world, and as a woman, an aspiring writer, a feminist, and a non-religious individual who is not scared to call bullshit on the people who make up the majority of its users, one of the things I was supposed to have expected, was that you guys would have dealt with me fairly and fairly harshly.\n\nAnd I certainly won't expect you to do so here either, at least to be honest.\n\nBut there's only one way of dealing with this sort of behavior, and that's through public ostracism and shaming.\n\nThis guy gets off on the notion that all of these people are the same, as I can tell you from his behavior already.

    "Written and directed by Alex Cox, this horror movie takes on the subject of \"Do not enter\" – the danger of not breathing in your local subway system. The subway system of Gotham City is constantly in decline so to prevent disaster and increase popularity of the subways, the Gotham City Council introduced a new subway station: the \"Ridiculously Cool Super Sub Station\" which is the hub for a number of different transportation systems. Not all of them happy about the new arrivals in Gotham, the subway workers attempt to keep Gotham's underground and city alive and thriving. From the sounds of it, the workers were not exactly thrilled about the recent additions and some have gone on a strike claiming that their employer is \"looting\" their pay in order to expand his new sub-station.\n\nThe story line starts off fairly fast. We get a short introduction to the workers' predicament and the new \"Ridiculously Cool Super Sub Station\" and then it seems like we are getting the meat of the story. We don't get to see much of the subway workers, but we do get more information about Harvey Dent and Commissioner Gordon. We also learn more about the subway system and Gordon, who is becoming friends with the subway workers. Although this film did not seem to have much character development, the characters are depicted in a fairly realistic way. We get information about Harvey Dent and his crimes, Commissioner Gordon, and their differences as they try to bring Gotham's subway system back to life.\n\nThe movie's main theme: \"Do not enter\" – that's what we get. As stated above, in this movie we learn a lot about the subway workers but what we really feel from our character interaction is \"I don't feel like I am going to be going anywhere any time soon.\" With this, I hope the audience will get a strong sense of the subways and the danger and what might potentially be coming. It seems that Gotham has some serious issues with the underground that we have not seen much about, but I would not say we have explored them to the full. The lack of exploration is what seems to have gotten to the film. As stated, I hope this film gets a strong response.\n\nFor me, this is a very entertaining movie. Some movies are good, but they are not memorable and this certainly is not one. I had a lot of fun with the characters and",
    "A Cabinet Office report has revealed that the cost of keeping the government running has gone up by the largest amount for nearly a decade, the Government was accused today. There was also criticism of the cost of security which, under the coalition, has jumped by £150million a year since 2010. On top of that ministers claimed the cost of Brexit had soared, according to a memo seen by the BBC. Ministers say the figures are \"absolute nonsense\" and that they have been in government for more than six years. Senior Whitehall officials dismissed accusations that ministers had been lying or hiding the true cost of Brexit. There is only political cost for the government in getting a Brexit deal - not financial,\" said one.

    "Japan's economy slid further into recession in December and industry minister Toshihide Suga confirmed that Japan is on the verge of recession. The economy contracted a little over 0.1 percent year-on-year last month, government data showed on Friday. Economists had expected it would expand a little over a tenth of a percent. \"The biggest reason for this decrease in volume is an increased trade deficit, resulting in the deficit increasing to 0.9 percent of the economy,\" Suga said, adding he saw nothing to change his prediction of a recession this year. The government's first estimate, released last month, had been for a 0.3 percent contraction. Suga insisted he wasn't taking sides in the ongoing bitter trade war with China between Tokyo, which wants to revise its pacifist constitution, and Beijing, which is also seeking to reopen its markets and move its currency lower against the dollar, to support an economy that has been flat for years. A survey by the Nikkei business daily yesterday found only 10 percent of respondents expected Japan to shrink or contract in the economy this year. The economy contracted in the first half of this year to its lowest level since 1989 after output shrank at an annual pace of 0.3 percent in October. It grew by 0.3 percent in the year to November, the highest rate in 17 years.",
    "The idea of being healthy, alive and \"welcoming\" in both body and mind is not an easy one. When your doctor tells you to eat a certain way to get rid of this disease, you'll often want to change. Many of the people portrayed in the movie do in fact change their diets and some others have made lifestyle changes, but the way Hollywood chooses to present healthy living is a bit problematic. The actors are incredibly thin, making them look much younger than they really are. When I saw my mom's new boyfriend for the first time, he was barely 5 foot 11. The movie also implies that weight loss is the answer to every problem, even though many people have a hard time losing weight. The biggest problem is that this movie suggests that thin people are healthier, even though the research on this isn't very conclusive.\n\nI wish I could give the movie 0 stars. It's a bad, terrible, no good, very bad movie.\n\n\nI know this might be premature given it is being made as a movie, but this review is still relevant as a critique.\n\n\nThe movie seems to suggest that there is no relationship between weight and health.\n\n\nI mean, the director is the same who made \"What About Bob?\", the movie where Bob Roberts was given diabetes by a single serving of a food and had to eat a lot of candy. You know, the kind that you can literally buy for 4 cents and eat it.\n\n\"What About Bob?\", in contrast, was about the effect of diabetes on people's lives and their weight. I'm not saying that diabetes doesn't affect people, and that it's not as bad as obesity, but that's a fairly rare and extremely serious condition. In the movie, the effect diabetes has on Bob was something like making him lose 1% of his body weight every other month. That's not very many calories!\n\n\nSo, this movie argues for dieting.\n\nDieting actually is part of healthy living. People who do that get to the point where they aren't hungry and can eat whatever they want. If they make exceptions to the diet, that's a matter of their own making. But the idea that dieting results in being \"healthy\" or in reducing the amount of weight that a person will gain is inaccurate and a waste of everyone's time.\n\nA dieter may not",
    "As a person with life-threatening illnesses, I'm often asked how often I think I would rather be dead. I can't speak for anyone else, but in my case it rarely ever comes up. There are a lot of things I like about being alive right now. However, I realize very few people would want to be as sick as I am right now. So after years of searching, I finally found something that helps me. It's called Prozac.\n\nSince that day, I can honestly say I'm much happier being alive. However, this doesn't mean I think my life is worth living. Life is objectively not worth living. Sure, it makes me feel good, but at the end of the day no one is ever happy with their own life. The only happiness you can have is in knowing you brought joy to those around you.\n\nI've been on Prozac for a long time, starting when I was 16 years old. Prior to Prozac, I was prescribed antipsychotic medications at the age of 10. There were a lot of ups, but at one moment in my life I knew if I didn't get back into treatment soon that I'd never be the same. My symptoms weren't just affecting my mood, they were affecting my ability to learn. My IQ just kept declining, and it wasn't long before it got to the point that I couldn't function in my classes. I ended up dropping out of high school that one year.\n\nThat was seven years ago, and I have been taking it ever since. It began during my first year of college, when I took two full bottles on the weekend before my freshman year so that I wouldn't miss classes. It took several months for my symptoms to truly come back to normal after that. Fortunately, Prozac is now available year-round, and not just in my school.\n\nUnfortunately, Prozac is incredibly expensive. The cheapest pill usually goes for $8 per pill. But when taking it daily, the price increases to $10. I'm not joking. Even if I used coupons, I know that I have to spend $50 or more every month just to stay on the drug.\n\nWhen researching how much it would cost me to stay on Prozac for a month, I found how much I'd have to pay for the other side effects.

    "A hierarchy of hierarchical attention networks has been developed, in which the model performs simple attentional selection on the feature images and a high-level model is developed to achieve greater accuracy over time. Two systems were developed, with different representations of the images (i.e. a local, hierarchical, and global) and also different learning methods (gradient descent for regional or global models and logistic regression for local models). Both regions and global models showed clear performance gains when trained with an attentional domain, whereas regions showed no advantage over global models. The results of this study demonstrate that hierarchical attention networks based on a global hierarchical model can achieve good performance while being relatively fast to train and apply, and offer additional insights into the computational mechanisms in such models.\n\nThe study was led by Michael Y. Lee at Duke's Center for Neuroimaging, \"Computational Medicine,\" and was funded by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship as part of an initiative called Project Imaging Neuroscience that seeks to promote and nurture the interdisciplinary science of brain imaging.

    "\"The quantum-classical phase transition can be described by an efficient nonlocal system for a single photon. In reality, the quantum system is a superposition of two different states, but the quantum state can be manipulated by a single photon. These nonlocale states are represented by classical solutions on a superposition space on the superposition space. These classical solutions are a quantum system, the classical states of the photons are the solutions to the classical wave equation, and the quantum amplitude of the particle and its position is the result of a stochastic process. A single photon can be used to entangle two classical waves. By using a single photon coupled with a single classical wave, we show that the system can be manipulated until a complete superposition is achieved. We show that the system can be manipulated such that for any single photon entangled with a state, the phase can only change if it is affected by an incident photon with a different state. Our results show that a quantum state is not just composed of a single coherent quantum photon but that a particle interacts with its environment according to the wave rule and not only the classical rules. This quantum state corresponds to a macroscopic single photon and it can be defined in two ways, that is the phase can be defined as the difference of two states, which changes with the presence of an electromagnetic wave, or if the phase can only change when an incident photon with a different state is introduced. A single photon can be used to entangle two classical waves, resulting in spontaneous superposition breaking, where a quantum state cannot be characterized strictly by the photon's frequency. When the classical state of the photon of a superposition is entangled with a classical state of the photon's wave particle, a quantum state may exist for long time periods in which no outgoing photons are detected and the photon is not subject to any disturbance. The quantum state of the wave particle is not affected by an interaction between two photons.\" For further information, to view the full paper please visit the arxiv.org site.",
    "Medical images are extremely large, often of very poor quality, and often have many annotated labels per image. This presents a compelling opportunity for data-driven learning of patient-assessing algorithms that could lead to improved quality and efficiency in their use. In this paper we propose and demonstrate the use of deep super-resolution deep neural networks to generate high quality class labels with minimal labeled source images (in the form of annotation data) in image classification and segmentation tasks. This design is based on a novel implementation of a dense convolutional neural network (convnet) that provides improved training performance on our test data compared to other deep convolutionsal networks. The resulting high-quality, multi-label annotations lead to significantly decreased label error, improved performance, and improved accuracy compared to other deep convolutional networks. This work builds on previous work on the subject of medical image classification based off annotated labels by Leffert et al [6] and is not a direct competitor to previous work [19].\n\nThe following figure is an example of what the paper looks like for one of the many tests they performed that we have been using in our training program on the pre-trained models.\n\nAs you can see, not only does they get much better than the previous best results for the network, but it also provides very strong training signals that can provide improved performance in the training phase. This demonstrates that deep networks are capable of doing a great many things, especially if they are trained with different parameters.\n\nFinally, they also have a nice demo/app that we have been using for our training. It doesn't contain any label, but instead it demonstrates the kind of image-level information that is being extracted, and the network can automatically detect and classify these types of images with very high accuracy.

The list has been circulating for weeks, and it has gained a good deal of coverage in major media including the Hollywood Reporter, the Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal, among others.\n\nThe list prompted a backlash in particular on the part of websites that the Hollywood elite have repeatedly attempted to discredit, including Gawker and the Guardian.

    "After the shocking events in the comics, Jason Momoa's first screen appearance as Aquaman is about as earth shattering as it gets. Jason Momoa is a big guy and Aquaman is a very small guy. He's got to go through a lot to make those big changes. The movie opens with a long sea battle that seems to begin everywhere, then shifts directions as you watch. The action scenes are great to watch. They are full of big explosions and interesting visual effects.\n\nThe problem with this movie is that it gets bogged down with boring scenes where other characters talk. I don't watch a lot of action movies, and there aren't many scenes like this that are worth my time. It's like watching the same footage over and over again, hoping for something new to happen. And then nothing happens for a hundred years and then a young girl shows up, wearing a fishtail-style suit, and the action scene is over. Like I said, boring scene.\n\nI still wish they had put Momoa in the suit and just put Jason Momoa in the suit. If the movie had done this, it would have been awesome. Instead, they take him into this very Earth-like dimension and give him an enemy with superpowers that is very much a copy/pasted Aquaman's foe. He could have easily been a different villain in another movie. The movie just seems to be following too many bad habits which are the kind of problems that can really kill a movie.\n\nNext up is a long sequence where Aquaman saves a lot of people from some underwater monsters. This sequence is pretty long, I'm sorry because it really makes you think about what we do in the ocean. I always wonder what is going on in the ocean. There's these things called \"mammals,\" which is different from \"amphibians,\" which is like dogs, cats and things like that. Mammals float around in water, and when they get wet, they stick to each other, but humans don't do this. We float in water, so, as you can imagine, this whole sequence is really kind of scary.

    "In the following this paper presents a computational study of the potential of recursive quantum repeater networks. In our discussion we adopt the functionalization of the quantum channel as a probabilistic state vector - this state vector we call the \"PQNT\".\n\nThe first idea for this problem was the simple quantum repeater network described in [9]. This network consists of 2 connected state vectors, represented as the vectors |v i | ≈ {0,1}. These vectors can be written with an embedded algebraic representation as |(v i,|b) i | = (v i : 0, 1 ⟶ |v i | ⊕ |v j ) i : p(v i : 0, v j : b). The computation of the state vector takes place in a topologically ordered fashion, with three steps. In the first step the state vectors are stored in memory, where each state vector is written with the addition of a pair of qubits, such that when these qubits are in mixed states, qubits that describe adjacent states will be mixed. After these qubits are mixed the second step takes place; the quantum channel is allowed to recover. When the quantum channel is in recovery we will refer to the state vectors as \"active\".\n\nIf we consider a real-life example of such a quantum repeater network in a system consisting of 2 channels, a repeater and a relay, the repeater can, if it is activated, provide a transmission link to the relay. In this situation the second channel would be able to send packets to the first channel. The next logical step is to consider a quantum repeater network where there are 2 channels, a repeater and relay. Instead of a relays we would have a \"quantum repeater hub\" which consists of 1 repeater and 2 relays. The quantum repeater hub consists of the same 2 channel states of the first repeater as the state vectors of the hubs. These hub state vectors, we will call \"hub state\" vectors. These hub state vectors are the same as in case of the original repeater network as in case of the original repeater network the hub state vectors are equivalent and carry no quantum information. Only in those cases where the hub state vectors are different to the main qubit vectors, the quantum repeater hub may be said to be a",
    "On a bright and warm day back on Oct 15, 2009, a family with 4 children were awakened by a chilling scream in their rural town of Edmonds, Washington. In the basement of what appeared to be a boarded up grocery store, a little girl in a black dress was screaming for help, only to be turned on to the horror of what was to come. The little girl has since been known as the Edmond Ripper. At first, the police are hesitant to name her as the 'Edmond Ripper', claiming that the name was too upsetting to the community. Then, some friends of the girl who attended the elementary school where these events took place and the local law officers try to figure out who this child could be, even if not all agree on the correct name. Now, as the second installment of the horror/thriller series by James Wan, \"The Conjuring\" begins, we have found ourselves in one of the most horrific situations; a family that's been terrorized and murdered by a child that no one except for the child herself knows. And so begins the series of events surrounding the \"Edmond Ripper\". James Wan is back with \"The Conjuring 2\". The previous film took place at the beginning of July, and it was in one of those places that Wan had always wanted to set this new one; an abandoned house in an old neighborhood. When the two of us got together in Edmonds and discussed what exactly we wanted to do next, we found that we both wanted to bring back an old and powerful name… Mary Hargrove. In the original \"The Conjuring,\" it was Mary's spirit that haunted the little girl in the basement of the abandoned house. But to be fair, we went back and forth until the moment when we felt we had a character that we both thought was going to be very powerful. While a good deal of time was spent in the original \"The Conjuring,\" Wan went a little different for \"The Conjuring 2.\" \"The Conjuring\" was primarily told by the two Edmond families. So far, we've only heard from Mary and her father. This time and for \"The Conjuring 2,\" we decided to focus on another of the Edmond families; namely the Hargroves and the McWhines. The Conjuring 2 continues the horror story the first one, and although its story",
    "We present a novel method for segmenting and integrating single, high-quality, fully-resolved 3D stereo images (of a 2D volume) into an interactive 3D environment. On the basis of the 3D image, an initial segmentation with bounding boxes and bounding volumes (BV) is created and we then automatically use a method of extended feature detection where multiple features of an object in the 2D image are integrated and bounding boxes/BVs determined. In these cases, the combined feature detection is computed by iteratively merging the bounding boxes/BVs of the 3D objects and finding the closest intersection between all the bounding boxes/BVs in the input 3D image. We demonstrate how we are able to greatly reduce the number of bounding boxes (with the assistance of different algorithms, including a convolutional algorithm), the number of feature extraction steps, and the amount of time necessary to obtain bounding boxes.\n\nThe goal of this research is to find a way to reduce the number of bounding boxes used when trying to segment images. As a way to understand the importance of the results, check out this video. This is also the subject of my webinar last week, where I had a chance to explain the research methods. The goal of the research is to reduce the number of things you have to do in image segmentation, allowing you to focus instead on other things that you can do. For example, when you are trying to find a structure within an image, you can instead work on the individual features of the 3D object (i.e., its rotation and color).\n\nAs a side note, the research paper has some video demonstration of the techniques being demonstrated in the video. You can also watch my webinar with the corresponding author of the article here: Microsurveillance: Uncovering Information in Deep-Temporal-Visual Data.\n\nHere's to hoping this research turns out to be incredibly successful!\n\n[Via arxiv.]",
    "\"Mick Jagger's portrayal of the enigmatic and enigmatic New York mobster, Nicky Santoro (played by Bruce Willis in \"Constantine\"), is a wonderful casting and an exceptional screenwriting. Santoro is the ultimate mobster's mafia kingpin, an enigmatic figure from the past who is driven by a single goal: to destroy his enemies and anyone who stands in his way.\"\n\nWith \"Constantine\" coming out later this month, I reached out to the filmmaker for his opinion.\n\n\"I did a great job capturing that feel of a mobster in the late 90's,\" he said. \"Nicky is definitely not a modern day mobster, although he looks like one, yet he can pass for anyone. Nicky is extremely intelligent, manipulative, dangerous and manipulative – that's the charm of his character. But his personality is based in the past and what it is like to be a mobster in the old guard. He is also very charismatic. So Nicky's personality is very much based on the New York mobster of the 90's.\"\n\n\"Constantine\" follows the story of an exorcist who is killed in a car crash and has to work with an FBI profiler - an agent who is in cahoots with the Catholic church and has his own mysterious agenda. Santoro, who had a falling out with the New York mobster society, eventually learns from the FBI that they do not want him to succeed in his mission. Santoro is forced to cooperate and becomes more involved with the exorcists, which gets him involved in a bigger plot. In the end he is pulled into a showdown between two powerful forces - that is when he realises how dangerous and powerful he has really become.\n\nWhat intrigued me the most about \"Constantine\" was that it was a very smart action movie - it is never going to beat the likes of \"The Hunger Games\", \"Divergent\" or even \"The Avengers\", but it does do some fantastic, well choreographed and well directed action. And the main antagonist was extremely ruthless and powerful - not only powerful enough for Santoro to deal with physically, but he is also incredibly violent.\n\n\"I was really shocked by what I saw in the script. There's a lot of detail in the script - and I had lots of creative control over the story and visuals",

    "All the reports on ratings have indicated that a \"favorability\" rating is less indicative of the success of a show than an audience rating. This was something which I noticed when researching what we were doing on Reddit yesterday.\n\nOne reason for this is that ratings are inherently subjective, and even among the same show ratings are widely varied. (I mean, the number at the bottom of an article about an average network show will have almost certainly changed over the last 5 years.)\n\nAnother reason is that ratings and popularity are only one facet of the audience experience and it is much easier to \"favor\" a show than \"disliking\" a show, especially when compared to the way you will \"disliked\" a movie or music show. That said, I believe the majority of television viewers are already \"favoring\" a large number of shows, so the ratings are not really so important: I feel less threatened by a show's \"favorability\" rating rather than its audience rating.\n\nI think there is a difference between \"liking\" something and \"loving\" something and I think that difference is important to consider. As a TV writer, I often think about how great the writing on a show is and I often get angry when I see a great TV show criticized for having bad writing. But I think that doesn't stop me from liking a show. Perhaps the people who enjoy the writing would be the ones who prefer the show to not have a lot of writing, but for me it doesn't make a difference to see a good show without the terrible writing.\n\nI often think that people will judge the quality of a TV show based on its audience. But I don't think that a good network drama must have a huge audience to be good. As I argued yesterday about the differences between \"favorability\" and \"engagement\" ratings, it takes a certain amount of good writing to make a show great, in my mind, and a TV show which is perceived to be not so great doesn't necessarily mean that the writing isn't good. I am not sure how to quantify these things specifically, though.\n\nWhat have you noticed about your use of the \"audience rating\" when watching a show? I wonder if people see this as more important in your use of it than in the other way around.\n\nShare this: Share",
    "Abstract\n\nWe propose that objects detected as members of other classes in a given environment can be used for semantic segmentation. We develop an encoding and decoding scheme based on the concept of objects and abstract classes, in which objects can be detected from information encoded in an abstract class of objects. To our end, we also present a novel classification scheme based on the principle of proximity of objects with class membership defined by one of the two inner and three outer labels. The classification results are very good, but there is a noticeable effect of the labels on performance.\n\nThe first version of the scheme we propose was based on simple rules that have a clear separation between objects identified as a member of and an object that is not. A model trained on the first version yields results comparable to those of the second version. We next improve the separation of members of and not members of classes. Next, we define a new mechanism to detect classes only with the help of the inner label. It is presented in the context of a classification system based on the three-label hypothesis. Our result is that we reach the same number of classes as, and in one order of magnitude better than, the class-based classification by the three-label version, but without the benefit of the three-label encoding. At the same time, we observe significant effects of objects on the classification success both for the single-class case and with two classes. In the case of two classes, the improvement with objects is even bigger, and in turn the improvement with two classes is even bigger. To further demonstrate the effect of the labels on object detection and classification performance, we show some demonstrations of the resulting performance. The results are compared to several other approaches including a full generative model, word2vec, and a neural network approach based on an efficient generative model.",

    "We present a multi-tiered training pipeline for deep image segmentation. We developed a hybrid training algorithm for finding targets of known and unknown orientations, then training a nonlinear least-squares discriminant layer to identify their corresponding image segments, yielding two new types of image features called \"locate\" and \"segment\" that are significantly different from the simple two-point classification. This improved representation for location-based classification and image segmentation is applicable to many fields of robotics, e.g., object localization.\n\nI have to say this has been one of my favorite research ideas in a while, if only because it seems an obvious extension of the idea of k-nearest neighbors for training deep neural networks from Alex Krizhevsky and Alex Graves. In fact, the paper uses the same basic architecture. The two \"modules\" in the training pipeline are as follows. There are three layers of layers to the model. There's a \"target\" layer as well. The target layer is given the location vector and the unknown location, which we will refer to as the \"targets\" of the target's orientation. The orientation layers are given labels based on the orientation of the targets of each orientation. The input class labels are multiplied by orientation and then multiplied by the total number of orientations, which we will call the \"orientation fraction\"\n\nThe orientation module has three input layers. These input layers are labeled as for one-hot encoding (U-values). The first one is labeled in the number of ones for which the orientation has occurred. This \"one-hot encoder\" receives up to 3 labels and uses its ones label to assign 1 to a given orientation. The second one is labeled the number of times when an orientation occurs within one second. This \"one-hot encoder\" operates in the same way as \"one-hot\" in one-hot encoding. It receives up to 3 labels and uses them to assign up to 1 label for each one-hot. These two \"long encoders\" serve as the \"one-hot encoder\" and \"one-hot decoder\" to the input layer. The output layer receives one labeled \"Orientation\" and the orientation direction.\n\nThen there are three \"orientation segmentation\" modules",

    "Minister defends sports minister's stance\n\nSports minister Nick Clegg was defiant yesterday as he defended his position on a row with sporting ministers.\n\nThe Sports minister is facing criticism from his Sports Minister's team over the decision by David Davies to back Ian Ritchie at the World Anti-Doping Agency conference in Moscow.\n\nThe Welsh minister, who was in Russia in a personal capacity, has threatened to resign if a UK Government minister attends the conference, which is seen as being pro-doping.\n\nDavies was criticised by the athletics minister, Hugh Robertson, as well as others involved in the athletics community for attending the conference.\n\nThe minister denies his attendance is connected to his involvement with Welsh athletics, suggesting Ritchie's \"views on doping are not the views of the British athletics community\".\n\nThe row comes after the Sunday Times was quoted as saying Ritchie's remarks about British athletes cheating were the \"first time such a thing has been raised\" by a British sports minister.\n\nMr Clegg told BBC One's Sunday Politics: \"Athletics unions are very well informed and very concerned about those sort of claims being made by British athletes and very well informed about the anti-doping situation in Russia.\n\n\"Ian has his professional views, but that is not to undermine the importance of sport and so on.\n\n\"I think it is the case that there are times when the role of ministers becomes quite personal and that is one of them.\"\n\nAsked what would happen if a minister attended an event related to anti-doping, the Sport minister said: \"If there is an international conference about anti-doping, or a sports conference, I'll be there, no problem.\"\n\nIt is still at the pointy end of that if there is a minister at the conference who doesn't attend the World Anti-Doping Agency conference and the sports minister attends. In that example, that minister in turn is taking the decision to not go, and they are doing that in a very careful way,\" he said.\n\n\"If a minister and a sports minister both go to the same conference, they both have responsibility to attend and the athlete has an opportunity to raise concerns if they feel they are not going to be met in a timely way.

    "Asian financial heavyweight ANZ Group has warned it could cease all dollar business, including the payment of deposits and the provision of finance, if recent turmoil in the world currency markets continue. ANZ executive chairman John Stradling told the company's annual results on Thursday that the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing political and economic turmoil in the US had put continued dollar-cleaning operations at risk and that ANZ would have to pause further dollar-clearing operations. The bank employs about 240 staff across Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Malaysia for the dollar-cleaning effort, which was set up in 2014, and is estimated to generate about $100m a year. \"The uncertainty around the political and economic turbulence in the US has put at risk ongoing dollar cleaning operations over there, and if there is further political disruption, or further market volatility … we're probably going to have to cease dollar-clearing activities,\" Mr Stradling said. Mr Stradling's remarks were an attempt to assure analysts that the bank would continue in the business but not put its livelihood at risk. The remarks also come amid continued fallout from Donald Trump's surprise presidential election win which has seen a spike in the value of the dollar to record highs, particularly against the likes of the Australian and New Zealand dollars. On Friday it hit $1.2935 against the greenback, its highest level since November 2015, hitting the mark in a rare bout of stability for the dollar. \"This is part of being a global bank, that we need to continue moving with the times and do something as long-term as we can,\" Mr Stradling said. \"At some stage we may decide maybe we are not going to do it, maybe we'll move onto other things.\"\n\nWe have to agree that all of it is unfortunate. It is so easy to demonize countries and banks, but it makes one question if it is really their fault. Sure, the dollar's value is inflated, but this bubble is not due to the people or politicians. We don't agree with the actions of the people who have created this bubble, but they have no control within the legal framework.\n\nHowever, what the world leaders must do in order to help their citizens is to have a long-term strategy to end the dollar's power over the world. We have been told for years that the world's problems begin and end with Washington",

It ended up being down for 15 minutes.\n\nIt's an extreme situation where his connection to Destiny and myself broke (the servers were all down in our town at the time, but we were connected to a central raid server).

    "Ultra-high resolution image segmentation of structured objects requires low-dimensional representation of the objects' features. Here we show that by using a new local-context detection framework, spatial resolution of real objects can be increased while retaining the high temporal resolution provided in high spatial resolution images. We find a method for localization that can recover high resolution from low spatial resolution images without losing quality. We apply this method to localize object boundaries and to identify regions inside and on boundaries of objects. Our results indicate a feasible approach for solving global object segmentation issues and for enabling higher resolution content within spatial resolution images.",
    "\"A jury of six women and six men in California have returned a verdict in the trial of Kurt Cobain's wife, Courtney Love, after just one day of deliberations. The decision came after a six-week trial that heard evidence from more than 25 people, including friends, family members and a former girlfriend. According to the prosecution, Love had made up a history that portrayed her as the victim in a violent, three-day sexual abuse by Cobain in the late 1990s. Love's argument was that the young singer was too much to deal with, and that Cobain, an emotionally disturbed individual, was the only one with the capacity to help her.\"\n\n\n[May, 1997] Courtney Love's new band in a nutshell: 'Oh, I'm just a woman' Posted By: Newsdesk.com; Posted On: 07/11/1997 at 3:28:24 PDT I found out Friday that Courtney Love was signing her new band with Daughters Of God, which is a \"guitar rock\" band. They're calling it a \"post-grunge outfit.\" I thought the name was pretty cool though. I'm thinking it's a good thing that Courtney Love is doing her own thing. In fact I'm sure that will get attention this year because that's the sort of thing that can do good.\n\n[May, 1997] Love's defense team may have made mistakes Posted By: Newsdesk.com; Posted On: 07/11/1997 at 4:40:12 PDT We heard in the early stages of her trial last summer that Nirvana's front woman was looking for a \"big money lawyer,\" possibly a \"gastro gastroenterologist\" to work on her defense team. That may have been just a bluff, or just Courtney's version of how much interest there was. It isn't so simple. In the course of the case, a former girlfriend testified she had been sexually abused by Love. In the course of her testimony, a prosecutor showed a photograph of what she described as Love's vagina, which apparently, if I'm reading it correctly, was a \"scary\" situation and she had seen it. It seems to me that this is where we have to start. One of the lawyers may have made a mistake, but Courtney has apparently been accused of sexual abuse and this could well be a matter for her attorney",
    "BATTLE FOR WESTERN VENEZUELA\n\nThe U.S. State Department's special envoy to Venezuela is preparing for the showdown with the ruling Socialist Party. For more than six months, the U.S-trained Bolivarian National Guard has maintained a brutal presence along the border with Colombia.\n\nRaul Reyes, the former deputy governor of a border state, has taken personal charge of the frontier.\n\nAnd, according to U.S. officials, he is planning to return to Venezuela with a plan to impose an American rule over a country that until now had been a key ally of Washington.\n\nA State Department source described the possibility of military intervention in Colombia as \"very real.\"\n\nWith two armies standing ready - about 6,000 troops from Venezuela's elite Bolivarian infantry, and 9,500 officers from Colombian border control - \"if they think that there's going to be a violent protest,\" it's very possible they can invade Venezuela,\" the source said.\n\nHavana does not seem to think that is likely.\n\n\"We have full faith in the capacity of Venezuela's army and the Bolivarian militia to defend themselves against armed aggression,\" Interior Minister Miguel Rodriguez Torres said at a press conference this week.\n\nRodriguez said he would be \"ready to work with any government to ensure the best for all citizens.\"\n\nBut what would be the impact of a US-backed invasion in Venezuela? On the domestic front, Washington has always insisted it has no interest in meddling in Venezuela's internal affairs, but there is no way of telling how a US invasion would play out.\n\nWhat is already clear is that there is more at stake than the status of a few border states. Venezuela's state-run oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, is the country's second largest producer.\n\nAnd, according to the World Bank, the oil sector accounts for roughly two-thirds of Venezuela's export earnings. If an invasion were to take effect, it could have the greatest possible impact on the oil sector.\n\nUS officials have tried to present the Venezuelan military's actions against protesters as a necessary response to \"violations of the Venezuelan constitution.\" But there's no indication the Venezuelan army, or Bolivarian militias, would tolerate the continued presence of pro-American Colombian politicians along the country's porous",

    "Based on the highly-successful book by Winston Groom, Forrest Gump is set in 1960's rural Georgia, where the local high school football star is suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts. \"I saw this coming,\" his teacher tells the class. He is suffering from a disease known as a \"slow kill,\" a disease he will eventually inherit. The movie's hero, played by Tom Hanks, can neither control nor comprehend depression. His family knows better than to talk to him about it, but his friends do. \"You know nothing about it,\" they tell him and attempt to help him along. He is determined to \"get back on the horse.\"\n\nForrest is a great film. It's also a great way to teach depression. I saw it with my father-in-law and daughter, both suffering with depression since they were teens. The movie was so effective that every time we watched it, we asked ourselves how we could help our loved ones. \"Forrest Gump\" gives me the courage to not only ask \"how\" but \"why.\"\n\nBefore I share my thoughts on the film, I want to get a word from the movie. The theme of \"Forrest Gump\" is that \"Life is short. Do the best you can.\" If you take this phrase too literally, it will destroy confidence. The characters in the movie are in denial. They are afraid that life will never change, or the events of the past are irrelevant. Instead, life is not in the past; it is now. Just take a look back at your daily life and how much of it is unchanged from last week. Life is never static.\n\nIf you learn to accept those changes, you will be much happier with them. For me, the best way to see the \"slow kill\" is to see myself as the character in the film. We all have our own little demons. When I was young, I dealt with depression. That's why I wrote my first book. When someone with depression says that they're \"depressed... \" what they really mean is that they have a slow death. This is what my father-in-law said: \"The pain of grief takes over a person's life, and if that person isn't accepting that it's going to end, and changes aren't going to happen, then it just takes over.",
    "And now to the part where I describe the way I became a programmer, along with some of the things I learned along the way. I'd like to focus exclusively on the programming job search here, but any relevant things will apply to the design-based job search. As you read this, keep in mind that the \"What are the best jobs\" part of the programming job search is a moving target. Things change frequently, and the job you find won't be the same as that you want.\n\nAs a side note, I have been asked by some who don't read this site very often what I do this for. A lot of people have had trouble finding the \"job\" they are considering, so for me it's important to help people come to a good answer. I did not intend to teach people how to code; though there are certainly a lot of benefits to learning to code, I see it more broadly as more than taking a job that pays about equivalent to what you could get from coding in the first place. I see programming as having the potential to change how you see and manage your time, give you a skill that you can apply in almost every aspect of your life, and that can certainly make you different from every other person you know. I hope learning to code offers you these things, and if it doesn't please don't despair; sometimes the best thing for everyone is to make a different choice.\n\nI started writing this blog post during my junior year of college as a way to keep track of my progress.

    "We're working on the issue of how to deal with the quitters. Here's a quick list of things you can try:\n\nFind out if your quitting is habitual - does it happen over and over? When you see it happening, go ahead and quit.\n\nUse a variety of strategies to try and avoid the quitting: get away, seek out the help of another friend, ask your boss to let you start over again, look into alternative sources of money (you might consider work/training positions at existing companies), etc...\n\nTry and avoid quitting that day - just as important is to not be tempted.\n\nIf the quitting doesn't disappear - find a way to deal with it.\n\nWe think that one of the most effective things people can do to avoid quitting, or to deal with a troublesome quitting, is by setting themselves up for success while quitting.\n\nWhile it is possible that some people will simply want to quit and don't seem to care - for others it is just too much! The difference between the two is the use of \"predictive control.\"\n\nPredictive control allows a person to control when (and how much) they will quit so that if the time and energy is needed they will just stop.\n\nFor example, a customer starts taking up smoking. He knows exactly when it will stop and he has made a plan for how, exactly, he should quit.\n\nA person that has never smoked could not possibly know this, but, using predictive control will be able to control himself and save the company a tremendous amount of time and effort.\n\nEven in the case where the quitting doesn't want to quit - something that is an unfortunate necessity - predictive control allows a person to be successful long enough to finish what they started; thus preventing the company from making such a serious mistake as to fail.\n\nPredictive control for the quitting\n\n\"How can I stop my quitting?\" The first step to understanding your potential quitting problem is to understand what control methods you do use to prevent quitting.\n\nIn this post we'll show you how a few methods you use to control your quit date all boil down to:\n\nIf you have stopped now, how would you do that in the future?

    "\"Skin lesions are commonly studied in clinical medical settings, but do not fit the criteria of an active disease. Here we develop an artificial intelligence framework to identify skin lesion types based on the images, using deep feature learning to recognize three categories: cutaneous, hair and eye-ring-like. The neural network consists of a convolutional neural network with hidden layers, followed by an R-CNN for localization. We apply our model to the training set of a medical imaging dataset, and demonstrate that it does remarkably well at categorizing skin lesions. Furthermore, our framework can achieve high precision identification to the nearest centimeter for cutaneous lesions, while failing to detect hair and eye rings. Our system is relatively cheap and does not require extensive external hardware, making this platform available to clinical laboratories that need to develop or apply a skin lesion classification algorithm for a specific goal. A final note is that the framework is implemented in a pure Python and thus has no runtime dependencies and does not require a specialized operating system; this enables automated testing and deployment.\"\n\nAccording to a presentation by the researchers in January, self-learning classification and classification from images has been applied for a few different applications in the last two years. For example, in an interview with IEEE Spectrum earlier this year, Robert Saxton, a computer vision researcher from University College London, described \"a really exciting work\" that uses a self-learning system to learn to classify images to distinguish between cars, birds and other objects.\n\nIt is interesting that the researchers from the University of Geneva want to apply their system to medical research. For a long time, researchers in the field of computer vision have been interested in using deep learning methods to analyze images, as well.\n\n[via IEEE Spectrum]",
    "It is commonly believed that all geodesic polygons have the same central feature area, given by the area enclosed by a polygon's interior curve. We present a novel approach to determine the central region for an active contour based on determining the feature area, rather than the curve itself. Our method is based on finding the shortest path connected to a given feature within the shape defined by the active contour surface. We apply this method to 3D geodesic polygons, allowing us to define active contours along any axis. Our algorithm improves on the standard algorithm in two important ways: it is robust against outliers, and it is more adaptable than any standard geodesic algorithm.\n\nIn some of the videos, the video has been taken from a different angle, and you can see that the line is more of a line or a stream\n\nBut there are several videos including this one where the path is clearly a stream.\n\nIf I compare my animation to the animation from the first post, there's a clear difference. The road doesn't end in some point in the middle of the road; it ends at infinity.\n\nAlso, the path is not perfectly straight in both videos. I assume this is because the video was taken at a different angle than the animation from the previous post.\n\nBut even apart from that, the shape is still a road.\n\nBut it looks more like a stream here than it does here.\n\nIt also has a much higher surface area, which the first post does not mention - could it be that the road is an active contour shape? Of course it could (since that's what it looks like), but given that both the first post and the animation appear to be from a different angle, isn't there some reason for this? And if I could take a closer look, I suspect there are two reasons - either the shape in the first video is not a geodesic or the shape in the second video is not a geodesic?\n\nThere are also several videos where the feature is not centered vertically\n\nBut what is the problem with this? In the first video, which is from a much different angle, you can see that where the stream ends, the feature does not cross, but rather runs along the road!",

He took it off his hands, got touched, I think there was a celebration afterwards because it was a huge call. I knew it was offside but that ball was not in our end - he's a player who has tried to hit us all season. He took a shot and I never thought the play was offside.\"\n\nThe following is the full text of an article from the Los Angeles Times:\n\n\"The goal was offside because, the officials claimed, the ball deflected off Marsch's left foot and bounced up in the box off Carroll's boot. (Marsch had no choice but to bring the rebound to his feet and shoot and not cross to the back post where Carroll could have tried to clear.) It was the fifth ball off the foot of a United player at the goalline through a first period that has led to United goals. It was also the first time this season that United has allowed a goal off such a play. In the first half, Seattle's Jack Jewsbury drew a penalty when he touched the ball inside the box in the third minute. In the second half, United's Kevin Harmse had a long ball bounce off Michael Parkhurst's leg when he was brought down by Carroll. Then, in the 85th minute, a bouncing free kick from a few yards wide of goal was tipped over the crossbar by United defender Taylor Kemp, who was whistled for kicking the ball. \"I don't think any of it would have happened had he (Carroll) not taken the shot. He's a player who has tried to hit us all season,\" United coach Mike Petke said. \"It's not like we have a guy in his 40s who is putting up the same numbers.\" Carroll, the league's leading scorer with 22 goals this season, left the court to a round of applause from many of his teammates. During the break, he said it was the fourth ball to cross the line that season. \"I don't understand,\" said teammate Nick DeLeon. \"I don't ever want to hear that from somebody.

    "The man who directed \"There Will Be Blood\" and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" has taken yet another risk. Michael Haneke has put a human, a very human character, into the most deadly and chaotic world on the planet.\n\nKurt Russell's portrayal of Nick Nolte in \"There Will Be Blood\" is both mesmerizing and terrifying. He makes his character, a former soldier, utterly human, yet with the kind of intensity that makes you look away and re-watch. The camera angles constantly move, but you don't have to think twice about what they're showing.\n\nIt is so difficult to tell what's real and what isn't, but Russell's performance keeps the audience guessing. When you see where he is shot -- in the shoulder, neck, groin, chest and back -- you might realize that at the end he is bleeding into the snow.\n\nSome people have already written the performance off as a case of over-acting. Others have been impressed by his choice of actor for the part, Russell was a professional boxer in his 40s while Haneke, a director from South Africa, is 49.\n\nTo each his own, but as a former boxer I can confirm that Nolte is a gifted and charismatic actor.\n\nThis is a film about death, war, hope, redemption, loss and the ultimate question, \"where do we go from here?\"\n\nI wish Haneke luck.\n\nWatch the full review:\n\nA quick note: This review was done on a video recording and may be different from the actual production.",
    "There are a number of issues I would like to get into when evaluating the plausibility of the idea that Battlestar Galactica's long gone, leaving a huge wasteland left by it. To start, let's talk about the nature of the show. It's always been about politics, money, betrayal and even a little bit of science fiction. Now with the release of the series 2 DVD, there's also a look at the actual technology used in the show, showing that there was an actual program in the background of the show that predicted the world changing. So the technology is really there, but that doesn't mean the show exists. Here's a quote from the DVD:\n\n\"During all the major wars of the post-World War II period, the U.S.S.R. was the only military force able to defeat the combined might of the two superpowers on a regular basis. At one time, there were several military analysts working on the problems associated with predicting the course of the future.\" -Dr. Stephen Hawking\n\nSo that sounds really fascinating, but that's not in any way a hint to anything of the significance of the show. On top of that, the show started out as more of a straight space opera, with the space station getting destroyed. It wasn't until the show was redone in the 80's that there was even the concept for \"humanity\" as a single entity, since the show was originally based off of the idea of an alternate universe. So the technology existed, there were analysts working on it, but it couldn't happen.\n\nThe other issue I want to bring to your attention is Battlestar Galactica, as a sci-fi show, had to be in space. That is its most important reason for existing, at least at first. Beyond that, the idea of a fleet of interstellar ships, all traveling at nearly light speed, and then a battle on the planets of a world, on our world, is so foreign to me that it's almost impossible to picture it from watching the show. What better time to have the destruction of these other cultures than when it's on our home planet? How does a civilization that destroys entire cultures and civilizations that were on our world for thousands and thousands of years know anything at all about warfare or strategies on our home planet without coming into contact for millennia",

The actors are all superb in their performances, making scenes between the characters all the more terrifying and terrifying. While the special effects were very good, I wish the story could have been stretched to the extremes and done it justice, as it was a bit undercooked.

What's the best way to handle this without letting on that I'm struggling?\n\n- [Redacted]\n\nHi Redacted!\n\nI'm gonna write you off as an incredibly self needy beta male. In all likelihood, the main reasons why you cannot talk to others is very simple - you are just extremely socially awkward. If any single person described it, you would probably think they were full of shit.\n\nBut you just didn't take the 5 minute quiz that my dating website did for you. It will tell you everything about your social anxiety. You have to take the quiz very quick. The test is simple and consists only of 1 or 2 questions.\n\nStep 1. Go to this web site and click on the \"How do you feel about talking to strangers\" button. Click \"Get A Test\".\n\nStep 2. Then click on the \"How do you feel about speaking with complete strangers\" box. Enter \"I feel socially anxious when a stranger brings up social topics\". (if you clicked the green question mark button, the second option after that one is \"I feel socially anxious when no one is around\". Select that one)\n\nStep 3. Click on \"I Feel Social Anxiety\".\n\nStep 4. Choose from the various options offered.\n\nStep 5. Now press return to finish the quiz.\n\nResult: Congratulations! You would be a beta male. You are not a beta male because you have social anxiety. You're a beta male because you've failed as a male and the only way you know how will only work for you.\n\nBeta males are the males who would only be successful in the company of beta males. Beta males are only allowed to date females who play the beta male game, and females who don't.\n\nWhen you see this quiz, consider the following.\n\nYou have an exceedingly small penis.\n\nNo woman would want to be with you.\n\nYou do NOT have the personality attributes that would give you the social skills you need to be in a healthy relationship.\n\nYou",
    "In this paper we investigate a method for boundary-aware segmentation using convolutional neural networks on video. Our approach implements a dynamic programming algorithm which is effective because of the large training dataset needed to train the network. In other words, as long as we gather enough data for the model to work well on the real-world problem, we can train the network in time, we do not need to pre-train on a large training set.\n\nThis is a research paper. While we encourage people to cite the paper's abstract when doing research -- especially if it is original work -- the authors will not be giving away any copies of the paper. Please include as much information as you can here.\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough there is evidence for machine vision techniques to be used for segmentation, very little work is available to implement them using convolutional neural networks. We propose a novel framework to train a convnet in time. For this, we develop a novel convolutional neural network and introduce a threshold layer that is effective to train the network. Specifically, we build on the work of Gu et al. [1]. We use the model presented in the paper and train it to label all objects visible in a video frame. Due to the limited image size, the quality of segmentation is poor as each segment is typically less than 5 pixels wide. It is not surprising that segmentation accuracy is lower than using convolutional nets alone. The convnet is able to segment the video frame accurately. In the end, segmentation is achieved without loss of quality using only two convolutional layers. We do not need to pre-train the network as we present a unique training algorithm. We find that this approach is able to build a network that is capable of segmentation of large images with relatively low epochs. We demonstrate that the network is also able to segment a few real-world videos. We describe the state of the art of segmentation using convnet model and compare our system to existing work. We evaluate our approach against all known approaches to segmentation. Our results show that our method of segmentation has a large training dataset, as well as good performance for real-world problems, suggesting that this method may be useful when dealing with very large data sets.\n\nThe abstract was submitted early, just hours before",
    "A component-trees (CT) approach is a generalization of the binary component-based method (BCM) based on the idea that each node of a sequence of binary features is a component of a sequence of feature vectors. In other words, each feature vector is analogous to a pixel in a video display. Component-trees are easy for a wide variety of scene detection methods to incorporate into their training and inference algorithms. We present the first version of CTC-based algorithms that are both accurate and fast, without resorting to traditional precomputation. Our system consists of several CTC-tree subroutines and a custom TensorFlow implementation based on the library OpenMPT. The implementation works on both GPU and CPU hardware, as well as at different scales. Our CTC-based algorithms are capable of detecting scenes from a wide variety of natural and social images, such as faces, videos, still images, and images from the Web. The high accuracy is due to a combination of multiple iterations of the binary component-wise method (BCM) plus the fact that the component-trees are recursive.\n\nThe abstract of the second paper, that described the new work on the CTC-based image classification problem, is similar to the first, with the only difference being the emphasis on the different algorithms and how best to implement them.\n\nThe papers were written by Andrew Ng, Sergey Levine, and Michael Nielsen. They have been submitted to the two most prestigious conferences on big data, the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) and the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Vision (CVPR).\n\nIt is encouraging to see the development of these two groups of researchers coming together on this very similar problem—to tackle the same problems together.\n\nNg spoke about these recent developments at CVPR:\n\n\"Big data is going to change the world.\"\n\n\"There is a lot of buzz around big data, but for me it has been about getting our feet under us and seeing how we can use big information to make the world a better place. With Big Data, my mission is to build a technology platform to help people understand the data they are collecting and make it available for use. In particular, I'm working to develop algorithms",

I had my first appointment at his last week and I am surprised that they will start me on antidepressants within one week – I'm only 27 and haven't had any prior symptoms in my adult life. My last psychiatrist was not supportive and it would have taken me much longer to find another that would have been more receptive to me. I have already been put on a mood stabilizer to put me on the same kind of medication that they will be prescribing to me. And, after taking the mood stabilizer, my depression started coming back. I've had this for about 6 weeks now.\n\nI had an appointment with my current psychiatrist this morning and she is very patient, not condescending or mocking me and even got me to laugh. I had been having horrible dreams and I've been trying to explain them to her in detail; she actually listened to me and had me write out the dreams in detail just for her sanity. I'm very confused right now; I'm not sure what to do. All I know is that a psychiatrist I've seen over the years is willing to prescribe me an antidepressant but she's the first one that has openly admitted that she is a very conservative psychiatrist in that she is very reluctant to change medications because of the way that she is perceived (I'm female and have a mental illness, and my friends tell me that they think she is making it up because she's very conservative and conservative people take their medicine). Can you please, some advice?\n\n(Here is a link to the original reddit post.)\n\nDear Anon,\n\nYou didn't read the original reddit post. There was a second post there that I removed.\n\nFirst, the reason why you didn't read the original reddit post is because I did not say that your new psychiatrist was a conservative in the way that you know about physicians. It simply said that your former psychiatrist (in my case my current physician, a male psychiatrist) was \"not supportive.\" I told you how this was a very serious problem (like an 8 or an 10 on a luster scale).",

    "\"We study the topological nature of certain special-case $K$-invariant free open groups that are of the class $\\mathbb{U}$ of ordered algebraic groups (ordered homomorphisms), and show that their $x^i$-terms are well-ordered and that their group homomorphisms are well-ordered. We prove that these ordered topologically ordered groups, in the language of algebraic geometry, include $\\mathbb{R}^+$ on which all topological orderings of the coefficients are equivalent. We also prove that there is a \"spatial\" notion of ordered groups by showing that any ordered group can be considered as an object of a geometrical space. Finally we prove that a non-trivial class of ordered algebraal groups which are open topologically, have the property of being open in all ways, have a structure $G$ so we have something to say about the class of groups that we call homotopy groups.\n\nThe special case $\\omega\\mapsto\\omega$ is one of the most important classes of open groups in algebraic geometry (for instance it is defined by the equation $2\\cdot\\omega - \\omega = 1$). This special case is very interesting because it is well-defined (since $\\omega$ is an open group), and it is well-defined for all types of open groups, and it is homotopy invariant, i.e. all morphisms of the group $G$ form a straight-line and every group homomorphism is equivalently a morphism of $G$ itself. These remarkable properties make $\\omega$ an ideal class for the study of the topological structure of algebraically ordered open groups (for instance this can directly give an index to $\\omega$).\n\nIn this paper we go through these properties in detail. We first give some algebraic properties which should be known to all. Then we define the most important algebraic property of $\\omega\\mapsto\\omega$, namely that all closed terms and open group homomorphisms are equivalence classes of closed terms and open group homomorphisms. We argue this is equivalent to a property which we call ordinality. This implies",

    "When the Universe is undergoing a series of fundamental fluctuations (such as cosmic inflation, the Big Bang and the current expansion of the Universe), as well as interactions between the fundamental particles in the Universe, it leads to new laws of physics when applied to it, which have an unknown impact on the theory of relativity.\nIn particular, the question of unification of the three fundamental forces, gravitation, the magnetic field, and electromagnetic force, can be considered as a kind of a puzzle in quantum mechanics, and since the equations of quantum mechanics have been solved in many cases the unification of these laws has been a quest and a long-standing mystery. Many theoretical solutions have been proposed, but no experimental demonstration of the proposed equations has been made so far.\nFrom the first, it was suggested by Lidar to perform the experiment \"in quantum-mechanical sense\" and also to consider the theory of quantum field theory instead of classical field theory (from which the mathematical framework of field theory is constructed), because the proposed quantum-mechanical equations are simpler and closer to observed phenomena than those of classical field theory. Although Lidar realized that these are not the only two possible solutions, he did not consider the possibility of the experiment \"in a more extended quantum-mechanical sense\". With the application of a new technique, the experiment is now performed based on a \"virtual group\" of particles in a single classical field (which is equivalent to the superconducting circuits of a quantum computer), that is the \"group theory of spin-spin\", in order to determine a new equation with quantum-mechanical behavior and to find the new \"unifying field theory\", that is the \"symmetry theory of the fundamental forces\".\nIn addition, the collaboration has established a fundamental connection with the research on cosmology, especially the cosmological quantum-mechanics at large scale and its implications on the search for the existence of an ultimate structure in nature.\n\"",

Aamir as the retired fighter pilot sacrifices his life to redeem his honor.\n\nAamir has to read several parts before he can settle on the best part in the film -- he has to play the part of a retired Indian fighter pilot who flew alongside Sardar Bhagat Singh, whose picture is seen on a T shirt that Aamir wears in the film.

    "[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16554.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16554.pdf)\n\nThis paper proposes a fully automated method for segmenting and registering multiple interacting surfaces through deep learning. The method consists of two stages: (1) global segmentation and (2) iterative registration. In the global segmentation subtask, each scene is represented as a 3D point cloud and segmented into three classes (background, foreground A, and foreground B). In the registration subtask, the segmented foreground classes are registered based on their 6-DoF transformations using a neural 6-DoF registration network. Once the registration is completed, the global segmentation subtask is performed again to handle the effects of surface appearance caused by self-occlusions and illuminations. Multiple iterations of registration and segmentation are necessary for convergence. The final output of the method is the segmentation of the two interacting surfaces that were not mutually visible. The authors' experiments show that the method can segment and register interacting surfaces with only three images without initialization and without prior information. It can also be applied to long videos.\n\nThis research paper introduces a novel method for segmenting and registering multiple interacting surfaces through deep learning. The segmentation subtask involves the detection of three regions: the background, foreground A, and foreground B. The registration subtask involves the determination of a 6-DoF (degree of freedom) for each surface. These transformations are defined as the 6-DoF vector. The final output is the segmentation and registration of two surfaces that were not mutually visible\n\nThe method was tested on multiple complex interacting surfaces. The results show that the proposed method can be used to segment and register surfaces without using any prior information or human intervention.",

    "Rugby union veteran Martin Hodges has announced his retirement after ending his 18-month spell with Northampton Saints.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who earned 63 England caps and won two Grand Slams, moved north from Bath in the summer of 2009.\n\nHodges, who made more than 360 appearances during a 20-year career, joins former Leicester team-mate Dean Richards in taking up a non- playing role at Northampton.\n\n\"I'm sure I will miss it, but it's time for a change,\" Hodges said.\n\nIn the 2009-10 season, Northampton claimed the Anglo-Welsh LV= Cup as well as qualifying for the Heineken Cup quarter-finals before being knocked out by Toulouse.\n\nAnd the Saints began the current campaign in impressive fashion with a 42-12 Premier- ship Rugby Union victory over Harlequins on the opening weekend of the season.But the Midlands outfit have struggled since and are in real danger of being dragged into the relegation dog-fight at the lower end of the table.\n\nHodges has played a total of 369 games for Bath, Northampton and Leicester but injury has taken its toll in the past three seasons.\n\n\"I'm not sure this current campaign would have been for me anyway with the injuries I've sustained in the last couple of seasons,\" he said. \"My decision was probably made for me.\n\n\"The most pleasing aspect of this final season was that I actually played at Welford Road on a regular basis last year which was a big thing for me.\"",

I am no stranger to needles. I have had diabetes since I was 7 years old.\n\nFor the past month or so, I have been noticing when I go on my insulin pump that sometimes I will get a little bit of pain. I know I have not used this particular injection site before, so I know that my body is not rejecting it.\n\nWell, I happened to be in pain and had a huge spot of blood on my finger. I was not shocked. I just did what I do after I do an injection. I put my hand up to my nose.\n\nI smelled blood, even if it was only a little bit (I had been eating a few grapes), but it smelled like blood.\n\nI smelled the blood, but what it reminded me of, was the time when we were all little and we were playing in the hospital and I saw my friend's dad, bleeding to death on a gurney.\n\n### That image has been hard to get rid of as it is, but this was the thing:\n\nI saw blood on the ground, and I thought to myself, \"I am going to smell this blood. It reminds me of that gurney!\" This thought made me very very uncomfortable so I made myself go do something different.\n\nI did not let this thought go away and just decided to not smell my blood any more for the next few minutes. I know I need to remember that I am not my thoughts and I am not that thought I was having.\n\nI know that, but it is hard when I feel so overwhelmed.\n\nWhat I am saying is that I have a very very large fear of death and dying and a lot of people do as well. When I was a kid I was always afraid to sleep in my room alone. I still have that fear.\n\nI do not think fear kills as much as fear of death.\n\n### What I am saying is that I am afraid to die.

    "> We develop scalable machine learning methods for optimizing over high-dimensional distributions with log-supermodular densities via maximum likelihood. These are the first methods for parameter learning based on a provable relaxation for this wide class of distributions, which is a popular class for rich generative models. A novel contribution of our work is a characterization of the class of densities satisfying the curvature condition, and a method for estimating the curvature parameters. Our method for learning the curvature parameters is based on the well-studied LASSO. We develop a new estimator for the curvature parameter using adaptive methods based on local polynomial fitting. We show that these estimators enjoy attractive theoretical bounds on their rates of convergence, which are sharper than those that bound maximum-likelihood estimates. Our experiments show that models fit by maximum-likelihood using these new techniques have superior log-likelihoods to their LASSO counterparts.\n\nThe authors are:\n\n- Yixin Chen, Stanford University\n- Prajakta Nimbhorkar, Stanford University\n- Yue Guo, Carnegie Mellon University\n\nThis is the fourth paper in the list under Parameter Estimation.\n\n## Why this paper is important...\n\nLog-supermodular distributions describe the joint distributions for a wide class of generative models that can be used for high-dimensional data. This paper focuses on estimating their densities from observed data via maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation (with a suitable prior).\n\nIn our class notes on learning over high-dimensional sets, we defined the log-supermodular property (Figure 7) for joint distributions and pointed out that the logistic regression class of models have log-submodular densities. However, the models that we covered in those notes cannot be used to formulate a high-dimensional generative model for data; those are mostly used for predictive modeling.\n\nHere, the authors argue that one can make many such extensions in order to formulate rich generative models that can be used for a range of tasks beyond predictive modeling.\n\nSome commonly used distributions satisfy the log-supermodular property. These include the exponential and power law families. For a general class of families, the",
    "Just a head's up for the new Viseart bright palette on viseartstore.com!\n\nOn Monday 3/27, Viseart will release a new palette named \"Editorial Brights\". It will launch on viseartstore.com at 6PM (CDT) - That's 9PM EST for us on the east coast and 6PM PST for Cali folks. Aside from the new Palette information, I'd also like to discuss the logistics of how the site works at launch time and how you can access it the best from the website itself. As usual, this will be released as a limited edition and will go out of stock fast.\n\n1. The palettes will be priced at $62 with free domestic shipping via FedEX. The palette will be exclusive to viseartstore.com only for the first month. They will be returning back to all our usual retailers (e.g. Beautylish and Dermstore) as regular products by the end of April 2017.\n\n2. We get a lot of inquiries regarding stock. As of Thursday @ 10pm EST, we currently have 170 units in stock. When this gets released on Monday (and every time this goes in-stock on a first come first served basis), it fills up VERY fast, and even the most dedicated people will usually lose out on this. You just have to be extremely fast. There is no exact science to it. It's all luck, and the site has been optimized to work smoothly for all browsing speeds.\n\n3. The site works best using PC, MAC, Android web browsers and is not compatible with IOS - If you see a \"504 Gateway Time-Out\" error on Monday when the new palette becomes available, please try another device - You must have access to a computer to obtain them.\n\n4.

    "In the first Captain America movie we get to see Steve Rogers transformed from the scrawny kid from Brooklyn into the first American super soldier.\n\nThe origin story itself is pretty good. The movie opens on a camp where in Germany some Nazi soldiers are showing new weapon (vibranium metal) to scientists. Meanwhile we see the opening battle of New York in 2012, from the point of view of a 92 year old Steve Rogers.\n\nBack in Brooklyn in 1942, Steve is trying to enlist along with his best friend James Barnes. He has a heart of gold and a will to serve, but he is rejected.\n\nMeanwhile the war is raging across the globe. Germany is taking over all of Europe with their advanced army and weapons. Captain America is introduced on TV as a propaganda tool to inspire the United States to join the war.\n\nSteve meets Dr. Erskine on the battlefield, who promises to take him out of the war. There is a formula that can build a nearly perfect human, and Steve Rogers is the one to get that chance. If it works he can save millions of lives.\n\nSteve goes through the operation without a hitch which makes him grow from 90lbs to 350lbs in one sitting and his physical abilities improve considerably. But things go horribly awry with Steve's best-friend Barnes.\n\nAfter a brief training session, Steve and the Howling Commandos are sent to Europe to take down one of Hitler's top henchmen, Red Skull. As it turns out Skull is a huge fan of Captain America and his propaganda and also happens to have the same formula that made Steve superhuman.\n\nIn the end Cap becomes the symbolic defender of freedom, and the leader of The Avengers.",

    "## The text\n\n> Spoiler: Could Battlestar actually be alive?\n>\n> This isn't a new idea, but I think it's worth considering for some of the following reasons:\n>\n> - It explains why he went to Caprica immediately after it was announced as the new model. He went there to be a part of it\n> - It explains the relationship with Adama, who as a Cylon agent, was charged with ensuring his survival\n> - It answers some of the problems regarding his knowledge of the final five (he was able to guide them).\n> - Its possible that, despite the replication process, there are \"flaws\" with Battlestar's original programming, making him unique. That could explain his lack of memories, and why he was so willing to rebel and why he sought out other humans in such a strong way. It would have been programmed to be the way he was by the Humans to have such a drive to help the human race and it's in that drive that Battlestar would be different. So perhaps he retained his memories from his time on Caprica.\n> - This would explain why he seemed to prefer Six, who was in some ways more human, when the other cylons seemed more cold.\n> - It would also explain Adama and Caprica's interest in his origins with some of his programming being part of the new model.\n> - One thing I haven't completely figured out is the idea that he might have been originally a model one.\n> - It seems like he was only slightly corrupted by the virus.

    "I am a 21 year old male from Canada. I suffer with terrible social skills, I've never had a boyfriend and the only close friends I have are from my high school (where I would probably not meet someone since it has been a year since I graduated). I am a compulsive gamer though, and play for about 4-6 hours a day. My career outlook is...well...not good. I have graduated from high school, but did not do well overall. My grades are not terrible though; they're just above average (not like \"I worked hard for these grades\"), because I was not very serious. Although, some of my courses had excellent grades, such as math and computer engineering (I did do badly in my non-math courses though). I will be going to college for computer science when the new year starts. I have done some internships and co-ops (4-6 month paid job placements), but not the best. The worst things you could possibly say about someone are \"does not care about the job in general\" for one employer and \"I was too shy to speak to anyone\" for the other. I'm very quiet and shy, and not very extroverted, although I would say I am very smart. I have a very high IQ of 160 (140 average for most people) and score very high on IQ tests (99.6% percentile is my last score). I also am not very talkative; I hate socializing and small talk and everything \"pointless\" about hanging out. All I want to do is to play video games, browse r/technology, r/pcmasterrace, etc, and hang out with my small group of friends.\n\nI currently live with my mother after I graduated high school, and she really wants me to move out right now.

    "One of the most basic pieces of information a patient should have in their hands when they start seeing someone is a good set of spinal x-rays. At the very least to have on file, so you can be treated, and to give to your next chiropractor or doctor. It is an easy thing to do, just have a radiologist put them in a CD or JPEG format, and a good one (and there are plenty out there) will even mark the discs with some good annotations.\n\nWhat should I be paying for this? Five will cost between $100-$300, depending if you pay your doctor’s office, or the radiologist themselves. I think that is too high for a service that basically involves you putting your CD in the mail.\n\nA chiropractor told me that because the CD isn’t just a flat copy, and the CD was put in the mail it costs $200 and 6 months. So $38 dollars per x-ray. So now I am thinking what the hell is the problem with sending him a $20-$40 dollar payment on PayPal, so he can put my CD in the mail. He told me I was being unreasonable.\n\nPlease help. I feel like $200 is unreasonable and I will not pay that, but I want copies of my x-rays.\n\n[UPDATE]: One more thing. The reason I do not want to go to the radiologist myself, is first and foremost because I think it will make me look bad as I just moved an hour and a half away. Secondly, I do not have my medical records in my possession, and because of #1, I would like my chiropractor to handle it. Please do not tell me to go to the radiologist though. I know the price there and while there are some great ones out there, I do not have that sort of time in my life right now.\n\nReddit users were not afraid to give their input on the matter:\n\nIf he says he charges that, just say “Ok great, when do I get my disc in the mail?” and don’t",
    "One of the more unusual puzzles in the combinatorics of queens on a chessboard arises on a toroidal $n \\times n$ board on which $1$ through $n$ are placed in $n^2$ unique queens positions to meet precisely three of the other $n$ queens in rows, columns, and diagonals. This is the toroidal queen semiqueen triple problem which was solved by Korshunov, Guterman, Schwenk, and Gusfield and Levenshtein. The original problem requires the $n$ queens to be placed on the toroidal chessboard using 32 algorithms which require on the average $8 n^2$ moves. Although Guterman, Schwenk, Gusfield and Levenshtein presented algorithms that use $6 n^2-O(n)$ moves their algorithms seem to require at most $n(C+\\log n-1)$ queens to be removed. In the study, $C$ is bounded by $2.767$ and the algorithms seem to work with the maximum number of moves required by the algorithm, which is $8 n^2+6 n-8$. The result seems independent of $n$.\n\nFour years after the publication of the problem, Guterman, Schwenk, and Schwenk, and Stinson and Lingas resolved the problem by introducing an algorithm using $9n^2+O(n)$ rotations and a sequence of $n(8+\\log n-1)$ queens removals that is independent of $n$ that uses a maximum possible number of moves. The authors are able to use $4 (n-2)$ queens removals as well as $4 n \\log_2 n-3n$ rotations before each rotation by using the addition of queens to remove the queens that were placed on the board. To do this a queen is added to a column that has a queen in the same row and column as the queen to be removed. These algorithms that are produced by Guterman, Schwenk, and Schwenk and Stinson and Lingas can be used to",
    "In all of the countless reviews I’ve read, I can’t find anyone mentioning the fact that Gravity is also a film about the realities of space flight.\n\nAs a science-oriented person, I was thrilled that the movie didn’t give off any of the fantasy and fantasy-eseque tropes that one generally gets whenever anyone tries to film anything that relates to space travel: I’m looking at you, Star Trek.\n\nIn the science fiction film, the fact that the protagonists are in orbit is merely a technicality, something to be used as a means for them to escape other plot problems that the writers couldn’t think of solutions for: it never becomes something the writers use to challenge their characters in any sort of interesting way. So, while films like Star Trek are entertaining enough, I get frustrated with them because they ultimately fail to realize what they could’ve been doing with their subjects.\n\nBut, Gravity does realize its subject. With what the main character has to deal with, the film is no longer merely a story about a space exploration movie; it becomes a story about space exploration itself. I’m not going to reveal anything to my readers, but there’s a point in the film where I found myself cheering, laughing nervously, and even gasping.\n\nOf course, I can already hear the cries: “This isn’t a movie about space science, this is a thriller!” Yes, I know it’s also a thriller. And in addition to being a thriller, the film does a great job at being funny. There are several memorable jokes and funny lines within the movie, which can often be difficult for film adaptations of short stories or novellas. But those aspects don’t make this film any less scientific. A film doesn’t have to give a lecture on the physics of space exploration in order to be scientific for it to pass my standards.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that I’ve always thought that there should be more movies about the difficulties of getting off this planet, or into space; not to mention, just how hard it would be to live in space. It’s a concept that few seem to want to think about, and when they do, they tend to make fun of anyone who actually cares",
    "\"I've been taking 3.0 mg of Melatonin for only a week (in addition to a sleeping pill, which I've been taking for at least a year) but the only thing it seems to do is allow me to fall asleep. As soon as I do it seems like something triggers me to wake up. I'm wondering if either my deviated septum (which causes a problem with the left nostril and snoring) or my sleep apnea are causes of this sudden wakening. I have read that melatonin works by inhibiting your ability to move, so it doesn't seem like I can be waking up due to anything that's causing me to move during the night.\"\n\nIf you haven't yet taken any sleeping medication, I'm guessing that you're experiencing sleep apnea, because of the possibility of your deviated septum. If it's really sleep apnea you're experiencing, that's when your body gets caught up in the fight, flight and freeze (freeze) responses which is why your body becomes very nervous. It doesn't make sense for you to be asleep; your body has to decide whether to wake up or sleep. This is why it's a hard thing to do and also why you can experience sleep apnea.\n\nAlso, when you've been asleep for a few hours you can have nightmares which will wake you up. I think that's the reason I'm sleeping less because of that last sleep cycle. If you've been asleep for six hours or so and then you start waking up every hour or two, you've probably been suffering sleep apnea.\n\nYou're in a vicious cycle; you've been sleeping less and you also have sleep apnea. The only way that you can prevent sleep apnea is if you have enough sleep that you don't need to wake up every hour or two. That's why you need to make sure that you're getting enough sleep.

    "The analysis of non-random features in amorphous materials and other\ncomplex physical systems remains a key issue. Among many other approaches,\nthe method proposed by E. Schapira and H. Leicht is particularly appealing: it\ndoes not require any mathematical assumptions about the nature of the studied\ndisorder. Despite its simplicity, the method reveals complex structures present\nin the data which can be viewed as hidden variables. The method is based on\nthe fact that one can perform several measurements of the same phenomenon on a\ndisordered system so as to reduce an originally disordered distribution of a\nvariable over different measurement realizations into well-separated peaks\ncorresponding to the different hidden variables. Once revealed, the hidden\nvariables are expected to be found at the relevant spatial and temporal\nscales in each data set. The method can be used for many fields of sciences, in\nwhich many measurements are taken on the same physical system. We use this\nmethod to reveal hidden structures as a function of the measurement\nscale. In addition, we study the emergence and persistence of some of these\nhidden variables during data acquisition, which allows us to identify data\nacquisition procedures and/or system preparation protocols, which are likely to\nbe responsible for the emergence of a hidden order. We apply the method to\nlattice models of amorphous materials, networks, and glasses.

This is the second day of the new campaign, and he's been playing for, I think, about four months? It was going fine for a while, until some of this things started happening:\n\n-His character makes an arcane lock. They're level 9, and at level 4 the wizard gets 5 extra spell slots. He has 10 spell slots, and a +2 arcane spell focus item. This lock was a magical ward at lvl 0 so was cast with a non-zero level spell slot.\n\n-He's constantly running up to things and casting firebolt, and the like, in a desperate attempt to hit things. This isn't bad, but its been a problem before, and now that they're lvl 9 its an actual problem!\n\n-Last session he used the spell hold monster to capture some goblins, and then used suggestion while they had the hold monster effect. (In D&D Suggestion is essentially a hypnotize ability) He was doing this for XP gain.\n\n-Our new character is a sorceror, which, at level 6, gets free 6th level spells at level 6. So I'm assuming he took hold monster as one of his free 6th level spells? He would have needed a DC of 12 to cast it. He rolled a 0.\n\n-It got fixed due to his roll, and a few other reasons. But I'm kinda confused at the whole story. He's also made a spell called true strike which just automatically hits any monster he uses it against. I'm unsure how to handle this.

    "> Superpixels are dense unstructured segmentation of an image and they have many applications including image segmentation and object detection. They are useful in many algorithms as a starting point (or a termination point) because they are unstructured and dense. Hence, they capture information (often implicitly) about the scene (e.g., grouped pixels of same appearance) but they do not introduce any inductive bias. However, the problem of computing a superpixels is not trivial and it is even harder when the input to the algorithm is a whole image. This problem is due to two reasons: (a) pixels of an image with the same label may not be connected and (b) in case of dense superpixel, the boundary between two pixels may be blurry. We propose the iterative spanning forest as a fast algorithm to find superpixels. Our algorithm is derived from a new graph-structure that we call the superpixel graph (SP-graph). This graph contains all pixels of an image (as vertices), as well as their relations within several “superpixels”. The relations are represented by a tree structure, i.e., a spanning forest in the graph. The algorithm consists of two stages: (a) finding the vertices in the SP-graph that connect multiple trees; and (b) merging those vertices/pixels that connect multiple trees into larger labels. This merging is done iteratively, i.e., all the merges happen in a loop.\n>\n> We evaluate our algorithm with nine standard image processing benchmarks. The results show that our algorithm can compete with some recent state of the art algorithms. More importantly, our algorithm is almost an order of magnitude faster than those algorithms, even in the large scale image case.",
    "This third series of \"POTC\" is actually the fifth official film in the franchise. It is somewhat of an extension to \"At World's End\" but a sequel in its own right. It ignites the first film's mythical origins and delivers a new story that builds on existing characters while adding new ones. It continues the franchise's mix of action, comedy and horror while keeping the same old formula. The action sequences are spectacular, some of the best seen in a franchise to date, with the comedy elements balanced well with the darker aspects of the film's narrative.\n\nThe film's narrative focuses on a new generation of pirates led by young Henry Turner, played by Brenton Thwaites. He is an inventor with a dark past and a desperate future. On a quest to liberate a family curse, he seeks out the only person who can help him, Captain Jack Sparrow, played once again with relish by Johnny Depp. Both characters make a reluctant pairing but it leads to a fantastic chemistry that is the backbone to the film.\n\n\"Through the character [Henry Turner], we got to take a look from a younger perspective and look back at the characters and bring them together for a whole new generation,\" says director Joachim Ronning. This sentiment is echoed by producer Chad Oman who adds: \"We wanted to take what has happened in these films, the history that has been developed so far, and move the franchise forward but at the same time, show how those histories are interconnected, to tell a story that's relevant to a new generation of movie goers yet one that's faithful to fans of the franchise.\"\n\nThe storyline is an elaborate one but is well constructed for audiences to understand, with its twists and turns along the way. Some fans believe that Disney has lost its way in recent years, by milking successful franchises in order to boost its revenue. However, this film will turn many doubters into believers as it has a great deal of creativity injected into it along with a genuine nostalgic pull that will give Disney die-hards that warm and fuzzy feeling that they look for in movie going.

    "> \"A fundamental property of quantum mechanics is that we cannot predict with certainty the result of a measurement on a single system. The degree of this uncertainty is quantified by quantum entanglement measures, such as concurrence, tangle, and discord. Here, we consider local uncertainty—the uncertainty of a measurement outcome, given that we know the values of all relevant complementary observables. We evaluate local uncertainty for the general form of the separable two-qubit state, and show that local uncertainty correlates with non-diagonality in the general form of a separable two-qubit state.

This transformation is a non-trivial generalization of the celebrated result that pure three-qubit states can be transformed into the $+1$-eigenstate of the NOT gate using universal operations by Bacon, Kitaev, and Shen [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 110405 (2004)].\n\nWe also demonstrate that for any positive-operator-valued measure (POVM), the action of a single-qubit unitary on one particle and a conjugate POVM measurement on another has a universal analogue in the multi-qubit setting. We call these the Kraus-POVM transformations.\"\n\nQuoting the author:\n\n\"The proof of our result is rather simple, in that it makes heavy use of tools that have already been developed and presented in the literature. This, however, should not take away from its significance as something of an \"embarrassment of riches\": it has long been thought that quantum computation required some notion of the conjugate operation, and while our result does not prove the need for it, it does give an alternative route through which many classical results can be proven (albeit, usually in a more complicated manner). I think it is also worth noting that the paper has some practical elements to it, in the spirit of [Wong & Barenco, 2002]: a method is presented for performing a 16-outcome POVM, with some preliminary simulations suggesting that experimental resources are available to achieve this. Lastly, the paper makes use of a simple \"doubling\" construction that allows one to perform two transformations in tandem, in what may be seen as a kind of two-port amplification.\"",

I cheated on my perfect girl and I am now about to loose the love of my life because of this.\n>\n> I am a pretty happy man and have a very awesome life thanks to the perfect girl I have been dating for the last year. She is probably the most incredible girl I have ever met and I have dated my fair share of girls. She and I met at the first day of orientation here at our local college as freshman this past year. We instantly clicked and have been together ever since. We have everything in common and spend at least an hour every day chatting on skype even when I am out with friends or family. I am a very loyal person and do not ever hurt people. I have cheated on every single girl I have gone out with in the past and have always felt really bad about it but my relationship with her was different. I loved her and respected her and have been a loyal boyfriend to her every day.\n>\n> A week ago, I was out drinking with friends one night when a girl I knew from my old college started talking to us. I did not want to go out that night and was really tempted to just go home but I really wanted to see my friends. Somehow during the conversation, I ended up making out and going home with this girl. Everything just happened so fast and I really don't think I had made the decision before I found myself half asleep in this girls bed. Afterwards, she slept all day and never called me. I went home and found an email from my girlfriend with a text file stating \"if you ever hurt me ever again or if I find out you did this i will end our relationship.\" It made be so sad because although I loved her, I also really needed her and she gave me comfort. I didn't answer her and went over to her apartment a couple hours later. We talked briefly and she basically just ignored me and watched a movie all night with her roommate. The same roommate i cheated on her with last night. She finally just said \"Goodnight, I am not in a relationship right now.\" I cried myself to sleep but felt better in the morning and decided to not contact her because I thought she would have calmed down after an hour or so after talking.

    "> This work investigates a teacher-student deep learning framework in a semi-supervised setting. We introduce and utilize our novel self supervising regularization for the student, to leverage the unseen images in an unsupervised manner. Our deep architecture for the teacher contains skip connections, making the model more robust. The proposed framework is applied for the segmentation of breast ultrasound images, which is challenging due to the complex shapes of the structures of interest as well as a large variability among individuals. The teacher-student framework leads to segmentation improvements; the teacher, for example, obtains mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) of 0.89, which outperforms our previous approach. Incorporating the unlabeled data in the test set into semi-supervised training also leads to improvements; the teacher obtains mIoU of 0.91 and the student mIoU of 0.90, which is the best result we obtain so far. We also visualize the feature space of the teacher and the segmentation heatmaps produced by our algorithm, for the student and the teacher; the resulting figures show the increased robustness, as well as the ability of the algorithm to generalize and to handle images that are visually different from the observed ones.",

    "```\nImage segmentation is one of the most important process in medical image analysis. There are several segmentation methods which have been used to distinguish anatomical structures in MR images. Among them, the brain extraction techniques are the easiest and common methods used for extracting brain tissues in MRI images. In this paper, we proposed a novel hybrid method for segmentation of brain tumor based on adaptive thresholding, edge detection, and supervised classification algorithms. Proposed method consists of three steps: First, the tumor region is extracted from non-brain part using adaptive method and edge detection algorithm. Then the tumor region is segmented using a supervised method called random forest. The main objective of the study is to compare the performance of segmented brain tumor and to evaluate the accuracy using some statistical measures. The MRI images used for the study are collected from various clinical and public database. The proposed method is compared with three traditional methods i.e. adaptive thresholding, region-growing technique and supervised technique (random forest). Experimental results show that the proposed method is more accurate in segmentation of brain tumor region with a higher pixel accuracy than other methods.\n```\n\nThere are many research papers submitted to arxiv.org that I never get to read. I came across this one today and it had a lot of relevance since I happened to have been studying a brain tumor imaging related problem recently. Thus I took the time to not only read the abstract but the entire paper as well. It was a good read for someone like me who has a limited understanding of image segmentation algorithms, but one who studies deep learning and machine learning problems quite a bit. I also think that the paper was quite well written. The authors introduced all the algorithms that they were combining, described them well enough and then clearly laid out how they combined it and why it worked.\n\nSince some of my favorite technologies revolve around deep learning and machine learning it was quite interesting to see how relatively simple algorithms were combined to get significantly better results. Specifically, supervised learning techniques were combined with the output of very simple image segmentation algorithms such as adaptive methods, to drastically increase the accuracy at which the brain tissues were segmented from a",

But its definitely a 1970s comedy... or is it a tragedy? I just don't know. The cast is really odd; from Bob Balaban (you remember that little dweeb, Lester, from The Odd Couple?) to Anthony Buckley who was the voice for the Red Baron from Sesame Street (which was on during the early 1970s). So how good will this movie be?\n\nIn 1970, Mike Nichols produced, \"Catch-22\" with a star-studded cast, many of them veterans of television.

The only time a level really gives you the space to breathe is when there are 2 guardians with 20 health. But then the game just throws 3 guardians with 20 health at the player. The game doesn’t really let you have fun.\n\nBut the worst part is that the game is never clear as to where you can progress (which was my fault, I started playing hollow knight with the map turned off).

After around 20 tries, I gave up, and just turned the map on and checked the watcher knight’s location before fighting him (because even though the map doesn’t show location, it shows if you’re in a different area).\n\nAlso the game is very unintuitive, and I have no idea where you should progress, and if you get the wrong hint off of the watchers, you’ll think you are progressing to the god",

    "> ABSTRACT — In this work, we combine ideas from multi-instance learning and deep convolutional networks for semi-supervised segmentation of infant brain MR images against a standard training-test split. Specifically, we explore the use of a large ensemble of 17 CNNs each trained on a different subject from the full study. A multi-instance, segmentation-based loss function is used to jointly train the ensemble, by treating each brain hemisphere as an instance and the segmentation boundaries as annotations. Our experiments are conducted on a dataset of 61 term-born infants, whose MRI images have been obtained at two time points. The images from the first time point (T1) were used to train the CNN ensembles, while a separate set of 19 T2 cases is the testing data. Our evaluation of the full study reveals a statistically significant improvement in segmentation performance (F-score for 45 brain structures) over several benchmark training conditions. In addition, we explore the potential of using the 17 networks to generate segmentation-based suggestions for the testing cases. We find that the ensemble of 19 T2-derived individual networks can provide useful hints for segmentation of unseen cases from outside the study. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset of training cases in infants with developmental disorders, and test the efficacy of applying the trained networks to these unseen cases. Our experiments show that these networks can also successfully recover structural changes that are specific to the infant stage and reflect structural abnormalities seen prior to the onset of clinical signs.\n\nThe paper is from University of Patras.

    "> Abstract: Camera-trap images segmentation is considered as a challenging topic in automated identification and classification systems for natural resource surveillance and management. Recent approaches proposed for these purposes include techniques which exploit multiple camera views, a large number of reference images or use handwritten segmentation masks. In this study, we propose an automatic segmentation algorithm using an unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) approach which segments each camera-trap image into four regions of interest (ROI) (sky region, the rest of natural environment, camera, and an animal). Our system works by first applying a robust PCA to a sample set of labelled images, then uses a set of image features computed from camera-trap images for assigning each pixel to one of the four ROI by matching pixels distribution in the feature space with distributions of the prototypical images representing each of four known regions. Our evaluations performed on two camera-trap image datasets (357 and 848 images) shows the average segmentation accuracy (defined as a percentage of correctly segmented pixels) of 94.29% and 95.82%, respectively, with average F-measure scores of 0.9697 and 0.9711. Both of datasets use randomly selected 400 and 1440 hand annotated images, respectively, for computing the prototypical image distributions for segmentation of unseen images.\n\nYou can read the full paper at this link.\n\nThe research team is affiliated with Binghamton University in New York.

    "> As far as I can recall, I don't think a \"Wrestlemania moment\" has ever been this overt. Since when did a Wrestlemania match start becoming about the moment for a particular superstar?

Obviously Cena vs. Rock, Rock vs. Austin, and even Cena vs. Orton were all big matches on the Wrestlemania card, and they were big for the card itself, not for these \"moments\".

And as far as I know, the best way to kill enemies with grenades in general is to just throw them at their feet and wait for them to explode.\n\nIn general, you want to throw your grenade close to another enemy so that it will cause a blast effect. The closer the other enemy is, the bigger the explosion will be.

I am not sure by whom the \"beautiful mind\" referred to is John.\n\nAnyway, it was this \"mind\", which, while working on abstract mathematics, started receiving messages from his roommate. For reasons unknown, it is not the roommate that sent the messages. It seems that the \"mind\" is trying to tell us that John never made friends with his roommate.\n\nOne day he realized that he has been receiving messages from his \"roommate\". He tells his \"roommate\" to \"call off the messages\" and the \"roommate\" does just that.\n\nFrom here on, \"mind\" is very confused, trying to reconcile with \"reality\" and \"hallucination\". He has a serious talk with \"roommate\". A psychiatrist friend tells him to quit math, which John declines. A new psychiatrist friend thinks that the messages John received are \"a form of inspiration.\" This new psychiatrist even prescribes morphine for John's \"hallucination\", because she thinks that John's hallucination results from real physical pain. This new \"friend\" is very smart. She suggests that John keeps a diary every day, especially when he has hallucination.\n\nSoon John realizes that the hallucinations come from his roommate's girlfriend. He is in love with her. The most difficult part of the film is John trying his best to forget the messages and the love.\n\nHowever, these \"minds\" are working on abstract math. These messages, while causing great pains, must have helped them a lot and the hallucinating \"mind\" still does his job.\n\nThe director showed that he did extensive research, with his name in the titles in the beginning. The characters he created are very true to life.\n\nFor example, the \"gambling\" friend is real fun. The \"roommate\" is very true to life - John's roommate is the most \"normal\" person the film.

    "The film was slow in some areas. Although the story is a good one and the performances are good, it was still an okay film. The best thing about it is the soundtrack. Natalie Portman's character is a weak one. The filmmakers could have made her more interesting. The film could have also worked better if Anne Boleyn's (Scarlett Johansson) father (Hassani Shapiro) had more respect and admiration for Anne instead of just showing contempt for her all the time. The script didn't do this justice.\n\nJohansson's acting is a bit weak but she does not fail to deliver a strong performance. Portman is a bit weaker but she's effective. Mark Rylance is great in a small, but effective role. It was refreshing to see a good British cast in an American film that actually worked. If Rita Wilson (who played the Queen) wasn't the mother of the film's director, (John Madden) she would have done better if she were actually given a better performance than she did.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed the film, I believe that with some work on the script, it could have been a much better film overall. This is worth seeing in the theater, though, simply because the soundtrack is so good. Rating: 2,5 stars\n\nThis has got to be the most overrated movie in history. The movie, for many reasons, isn't even in the top 10 best historical movies. If you want a great film about the Boleyn girls, check out \"The Tudors\", it's so much better than this film. They should be ashamed to call a movie that isn't \"good\" the best historical film. What a waste of time and money. (Rating: 1,5 stars)",

    "\"Medical facial, voice and gait recognition have already entered everyday life and are being used in various tasks. However, the question remains whether these recognition methods are capable of identifying people when they have suffered from diseases or injury. Even if this is possible, it can be difficult to make judgments regarding the identity of a person based on medical indicators because such features have not yet been studied in enough detail. In the paper we explore the iris recognition and the possibility of its usage for the identification of pathological changes in the eye. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt of its kind to explore iris recognition in cases of eye pathology. A database with color and 3D iris images and corresponding pathologies is presented. The dataset is useful for future iris recognizers training and analysis of iris de- identification.

    "The rate of star formation is a key parameter for galaxy evolution. While most recent work relies on SFR diagnostics based on the ultraviolet and/or infrared continuum, direct measurements provide independent information on how the star-formation rate (SFR) of galaxies varies on the time scales of interest. In this work, we study the bursting nature of star formation (SF) in a galaxy sample selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), using diagnostics on the color-magnitude, color-color, and Halpha and stellar-population aging diagnostics.\n\nFrom a total of 1,592 galaxies found in the SDSS, 1,091 present a SFR greater than 0.2 ${\\ M}_{\\odot} {\\ {\\rm yr}}^{-1}$, a lower limit to the true SFR required by recent studies. From the total sample, 182 have two or more independent measures for the current SFR (e.g. infrared, ultraviolet, Halpha), of which 139 are present in the compilation of Kennicutt & Evans (2008). While galaxies whose current SFR has been independently determined show SF rate variations of ~30 percent, the rest of the sample exhibits variations as high as one order of magnitude.\n\nThe fraction of bursting systems varies with stellar mass: higher for galaxies of low stellar mass, $< 1.9 {\\ \\times10^9} {\\ {\\rm M}_\\odot}$) than high mass galaxies ($M> 1.9{\\ \\times10^9} {\\ {\\rm M}_\\odot} )$, where the fraction of galaxies with current SFR measured independently of the SFR-related diagnostics is lower, indicating that this is likely a sample selection effect.\n\nThe bursting nature of SFR is studied as a function of redshift from 0 < z < 0.5 for three stellar-mass selections: one for the lowest stellar mass ($< 1.9 {\\ \\times10^9}\\ {\\rm M}_\\odot$), the other two for higher stellar masses ($> 1.9 {\\ \\times",

    "> Segmentation of medical images is one of the main tasks in computer-aided medical diagnosis. It is a data-hungry task that requires a large number of labeled training images to achieve promising performance. However, a significant portion of image segmentation jobs in the medical domain are one-shot jobs requiring a trained model for just one case. To address the lack of high-quality training data, a data augmentation scheme is needed that can enhance the small set of images provided for one-shot labeling while preserving the characteristics of the given image(s). In this work, we present a novel data augmentation framework which generates synthetic, high-quality augmentation images of images provided for one-shot labeling. The proposed augmentation framework is based on learning and applying synthetic image transformations with probabilistic distributions that best fit the given set (or sets) of images. Our experiments show that the proposed method effectively enhances the number of augmentation examples generated for an image in the one-shot setting. This is reflected in the final model obtained which achieves better segmentation results compared to training on just a few single images.\n\n[Image: iStock/Getty Images Plus/biksu27]\n\nMore on this topic:",

    "> A labeling of vertices of a graph G is an assignment of non-negative weights to the vertices $u∈V(G)$ so that for every non-null edge $(u, v)$ either\n>\n> $(1) f(u)>f(v), \\quad$ or\n>\n> $(2) w(u, v)=f(u)=f(v)$.\n>\n> If the second possibility holds, the pair $(u, v)$ is said to be a list-antimagic pair. The labeling $f$ is called list-antimagic and the minimum possible maximum $f(u)$ of the labeling $f$ is called the list-antimagic index. The weight function $w$ can represent several features of a graph as is represented in the literature: $w(u, u)=0$ if vertex $u$ represents a node, and $w(u, u)=k$ represents degree $k$. Labelings based on degrees are of special interest because they serve to count nodes connected to a given number $k$ of nodes in a graph.\n>\n> List-antimagic labelings were first defined in 2011. The authors of this paper proved the problem NP-complete for graphs with at least six vertices and provided an upper bound of $3k−6+1$ for the index of bipartite graphs of diameter $2k+1$ and for complete $k$-partite graphs. Since then, researchers have obtained upper and lower bounds as well as constructions for special classes of graphs and the list-antimagic index for complete graphs. We prove that every weighted graph of diameter at most $k$ is list-magic with weight function $w(u, v)=i$ if the distance $d(u, v)=i$. We prove that the list-antimagic index of bipartite graphs is upper bounded by twice their maximum degree and we also show how this index can be achieved for a family of bipartite graphs.\n\nSource: arxiv.org\n\ncomments powered by Disqus",
    "> Precise segmentation of medical images of abnormal organs or tissues provides important preoperative information for clinical staff, and computer-aided diagnosis can improve a doctor's diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a 3D region of interest (RoI)-aware encoder-decoder network called RoI-U-Net to segment polyps in virtual colonoscopy (VC) datasets. In contrast to previous medical segmentation methods, our model is well suited for VC by generating contours of the polyps directly from the polyp center. The model is trained using only a small number of 3D samples with the small size of each center, and our model achieves 84.14% accuracy on an average of four 3D datasets. We also visualize the learned RoI-U-Net to verify its potential utility in other clinical tasks. Moreover, a statistical analysis of the segmentation performance is conducted to better understand the proposed network's effectiveness. The source code of this work can be found at https://github . com/hongyun0726/RoI-U-Net.\n\n### MRI and CT Colonography\n\nColon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death. In terms of the number of people diagnosed per year and the number of deaths, colon cancer ranks the third after lung and breast cancer. In the United States, the overall incidence rates are higher in African American (AA) women than in all women and the highest in AAs men. According to the data from 2015 to 2016, the AAs have the highest diagnosis rates of colorectal cancer (CRC), and approximately 5% of AAs with CRC develop the disease at a younger age.\n\nAt present, CTC and MRI colonography are preferred for detecting colorectal polyps. Virtual colonoscopy (VC) and endoscopic methods are the most commonly used colon cancer screening methods worldwide. Virtual colonoscopy involves X-ray CT imaging and MRI.

    "In this paper, we propose a compressive beamforming framework to detect both slowly varying directions of arrival (DOAs) and the corresponding slowly varying magnitudes (SNRs) of signals using few snapshots. Specifically, we first design two time-varying multi-sensor beamformers, where one beam-former provides an estimate of the spatial signatures using a novel multiple snapshot compressive sensing (MSCS) method that we recently proposed, while the other provides an estimate of DOAs and the magnitudes using only a single snapshot. The MSCS beamformer is then leveraged by the single snapshot beamformer to jointly estimate the spatial signatures and DOA magnitudes for all desired DOAs using few snapshots. We further propose novel optimization algorithms using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to compute the signal estimates that achieve a favorable trade-off between measurement and DOA estimation time. In particular, both MSCS and single snapshot beamformers are combined together by an ADMM-based method that allows for fast and accurate estimation of the DOA magnitudes using several snapshots for an entire angular sector. The proposed framework is then evaluated for a realistic sparse sensing scenario based on real measurement data using a virtual array to reveal the potential performance gains that we demonstrate numerically. Our simulation results reveal that the DOA magnitude estimation error can be reduced by up to 20 dB compared to classical beamformer methods\n\nThis research paper shows how the use of multiple snapshots in compressive beamforming can significantly improve the quality of DOA magnitude estimates. The authors have proposed an ADMM-based framework, which is able to provide accurate estimates for a wide range of spectral signal distributions. The results of this study highlight the potential benefits of using multiple snapshots in compressive beamforming for direction-finding applications.\n\n## References:\n\n1.

Both add to the movie, but the look is more important. It reminds me of old films like \"To Have and to Hold\" and \"Double Indemnity\" (these aren't even very close), which adds to the feeling of mystery and susp",

Flannery's character is an unassuming character who gets most of the funny lines. Jackie Moan is just a funny guy who does some really dumb and crazy things, like taking the ball away from Clarence \"Monkey\" Caldwell (Will Arnett), the team's best player, because he thinks he knows what he's doing. There is a great character moment where Jackie takes Monkey down from a d",
    "\"Purpose: Cardiac pathology classification is a challenging task and has not been adequately studied on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with respect to the full information in cine MRI. Characterization of apparent flows on cine MRI can be used to distinguish different types of cardiac pathologies. However, a direct application of flow estimations directly to classification may result in reduced performance. Therefore, we propose a data-driven learning method to automatically associate the characterization of apparent flows to specific cardiac pathologies to perform classification.\n\nMethods: The method is based on semi-supervised learning of apparent flows by using both labeled and unlabeled cine MRI data to obtain classification of these flows. We use a two-step approach to classify cine MRI into multiple classes. First, apparent flows of cine MRI are represented by quantitative measures that are based on the temporal variation of apparent flows. By using apparent flows of labeled MRI, an automated feature learning is performed and a set of quantitative features is extracted. Apparent flows of unlabeled MRI are represented by the same set of quantitative features. In the second step, the association between quantitative features and class labels of the labeled MRI are learned by a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Then the learned association is used to classify the unlabeled data by the same classifier trained on labeled MRI.\n\nResults: The accuracy of classification is quantitatively assessed on cine MRI of multiple classes: 8% of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 25% of hypertension (HTN), 37% of ischemic heart disease (IHD), and 30% of normal (N) classes on 8-subjects. HCM, HTN, and N are well-classified (92.3%, 88.9%, 82.8%, resp.), but IHD is not well-classified (48%).\n\nConclusion: We proposed a semi-supervised learning method to perform classification of cine MRI with a quant",

    "What hatches out of the egg?\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\nI believe that the following story can be found in the book \"The Mysteries of Eggs and Hens and How to Solve Them. It was written by an 18th century Russian scientist named Mikhail Lomonosov. As far as I know, it was translated from Russian by a friend, but I cannot confirm this.\n\nFor the purposes of this short story, I'll assume that Lomonosov lived in the 17th Century.\n\nOne day, Lomonosov was in his garden doing his usual business of feeding chickens and pigs. After he made his way around the garden, he noticed something strange. There were three chickens on the ground and a single egg sitting on the ground behind them. When he came back around, the chickens were gone, as were the eggs. When Lomonosov looked at them, he noticed that they were not normal eggs. He put the eggs under a microscope and saw that each egg had the shape of a human hand. The hand was attached to a human arm, and the hand was holding the egg.\n\nAs the egg hatched, the human arm grew faster than the hand, and finally, it began to grow so fast that the hand became disconnected from the arm. When the hand was disconnected, Lomonosov saw that the arm was holding an egg. Then, as the egg grew, the egg was attached to the hand of Lomonosov. When Lomonosov saw that the hand was holding an egg, he began to believe that he had discovered a way to create human hands from eggs.\n\nSoon, Lomonosov began to believe that it was possible for a human being to create human hands from eggs. He began to write letters to the Romanovs about this. He was convinced that his letters would be read by the Romanovs and that the Russian people would be told of this discovery. The Romanovs were so impressed with Lomonosov's letters, that they allowed him to set up a laboratory in their palace. He was working there, when he began to see that one egg was the same shape as the egg he had found in the garden. He thought that was strange,",

    "We propose a framework to address shortcomings of current state-of-the-art methods using a novel region-based homogeneity enhancement technique. It is based on the fact that implicit assumptions on edge/boundary positions implicit in these methods lead to misclassification of some pixels or boundary discontinuities. We propose a framework that does not rely on any implicit assumptions, but rather it explicitly uses geodesics to constrain the boundary position. An interesting property of the formulated model is that it implicitly enhances region homogeneity by incorporating both a pixel intensity-based energy term and an edge position constraint term. For this purpose, we have designed a cost function which accounts for the effect of geodesic boundaries on the image pixels intensities. The proposed model also includes a regularizer which is derived based on the proposed edge position constraint. Consequently, we introduce a new image segmentation framework based on geodesic active contours where boundaries are controlled by the image intensity gradients, and pixel intensities are also regulated based on the influence of geodesics. Evaluation of the proposed method on real images demonstrates improvements on both quantitative as well as qualitative measures.\n\nCite:\n\nGeodesic Paths for Image Segmentation with Implicit Region-based Homogeneity Enhancement\n\nby Hengameh Vadi, Morteza Jalali Vand and Alireza Tavakolian\n\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran\n\narXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7200",

It's still quite hard to get that it's actually happened.\"\n\nHowever, it will be a tough task, as he has played far fewer matches than the Swede, who knocked out top seed Rafael Nadal last time out.\n\nThe Scot said: \"I don't feel tired, I don't feel really any pain anywhere, so if I don't feel it then I will try my best.\"\n\nThe 22-year-old said he does not take too much stock in the fact that he will be the first British man to reach the final since 1936, when Perry won the title.\n\n\"It is something that has been mentioned a fair bit, but I was not really bothered at all, if I am being honest,\" he said.\n\n\"It would be the same way if I was not British.

    "Here's a question about something I've been trying to figure out for a while. My boyfriend (40) and I (34) have been together for about three years. When we first met, which was in an online dating profile, we quickly bonded over a shared love of music. In fact, our initial conversation was filled with music references and inside jokes. It didn't take long for me to realise he really knew his stuff and took it pretty seriously. We would debate the finer points of certain artists, albums, and songs and share our playlists. We were both really into indie rock, and I loved sharing the music I had written myself. We spent a lot of time listening to my songs, which I consider the best way for me to introduce him to my music, but I felt like he wasn't quite taking it as seriously as I was. He rarely offered any opinions on my work, and when he did it was usually in the form of a compliment. Sometimes it was hard to get him to talk about it at all, but I did my best to try to understand why he didn't seem very interested. After a week or so we shared our first song together, and he didn't give much feedback, but was generally pleased with it. A few days later we were discussing a really old song of mine when he remarked that it was 'very aggressive,' and I asked him what that meant. He said he meant that I was more 'playful,' which made absolutely no sense to me. I wasn't aggressive in the song, and he knew that my music wasn't aggressive at all. I don't get the meaning behind his statement, and if he does mean what he said, I'm pretty sure he doesn't get me at all. Any ideas?\n\nDoes this sound aggressive or playful? Weird. Anyway, it didn't take much time before I realized he was super into my music, and he started to ask for more of it. At some point things got really serious, so we decided to write a song together once we were in a relationship, and he said he would really like that. We got into the studio together, and when I asked what kind of song he wanted, he basically laughed and told me to just wing it. I did, and he was",

    "The fifth installment of the Harry Potter series, this one directed by David Yates as a prequel to the sixth movie, \"Half Blood Prince\", is by far the best entry in the series to date. The previous installments have all had their unique pluses and minuses, and this one continues where the fourth left off: J.K. Rowling's storyline is given a far more compelling and serious treatment in this movie than was heretofore possible.\n\nThe main theme in this movie is the rise to power of Lord Voldemort, formerly known as Tom Riddle and Harry's greatest threat. This film shows how Voldemort's rise to power is made possible by the intractable infighting of the powerful wizarding elite as they battle for power and control using the children who form the student body of Hogwarts -- the world's powerful wizard institution, for which Harry happens to be the newest inductee. When Hogwarts turns into a concentration camp-like incarnation of Big Brother, and Voldemort becomes the headmaster, Harry learns that his destiny may be to save the world from evil.\n\nThe acting and the action are both excellent in this film, and the story is given all the emphasis that it needs, with lots of wizarding \"porn\" and a few new characters introduced (Luna Lovegood and Alastor Moody, played beautifully by Zoe Wanamaker, are all new, as is the terrific Gary Oldman in a small, but extremely important cameo as Sirius Black's father). All of the actors are clearly in their element now, especially young actors who are now at the point where they are beginning to play characters their own ages and not characters one decade younger, and their work gives real depth and understanding to every facet of the movie.\n\nIt must be said, though, that one of the most thrilling and important aspects of this movie is that it treats young people as if they were full adults. All of the action in this movie -- or at least the good action -- takes place in Hogwarts itself rather than being just a series of special effects, and there's a sense of real, visceral susp",
    "The \"New World\" tells the story of the coming together of Europeans and Native Americans when the first English settlers arrived on the coast of what became the Virginia Colony. More accurately, it tells the story of two men and one woman from those peoples. These are John Rolfe, a Virginia planter and Captain John Smith, an English soldier. The other is Pocahontas, one of the most famous of Native Americans.\n\nIn the film, one of the English, John Smith, played a key role in the bringing together of the settlers and tribe members. But Pocahontas, played by the talented newcomer, Q'orianka Kilcher, is the focus of the movie and of the relationship. As to why the script went this way, I have absolutely no idea. The decision was made though.\n\nThe film's opening scenes show Smith and his fellow English settlers meeting with Powhatan, a great chief who is the father of Pocahontas, played by a stunning newcomer, Q'orianka Kilcher. A tense meeting takes place between Captain John Smith and Powhatan and is interrupted by Pocahontas who saves the Englishman's life. I have to say that I've read quite a bit about the Jamestown story and had never read or heard about this particular meeting. The film presents it as if it was an accurate record of events and since it is presented so forcefully, one assumes that it is. But it is not. As I say, it is the first meeting between the two peoples but not the first meeting for Pocahontas and the two English men. To read more go to Movie Review: The New World.",

    "> The goal of this work is to develop a system for pixel-level image segmentation in a broad range of biomedical domains. We do not assume access to individualized training data for each new problem or any large labeled dataset for pre-training. Nevertheless, this general system achieves competitive results on several image segmentation tasks. It also achieves competitive results on data that has not yet been seen during training. These results suggest that the system generalizes to new data reasonably well, despite no exposure to this data during training. This is accomplished by a neural network architecture that is able to be trained end-to-end, jointly optimizing the weights of a U-net decoder and the weights of a sequence of 1D convolutions as a lightweight feature extractor or encoder. We also improve on prior work with a system that has many fewer parameters than its predecessor, making it easier to find good architectural features and faster to train. This reduction in parameters occurs while improving on reported accuracy of the prior system, which was already state-of-the-art. We further demonstrate the generality of our network by showing its ability to learn directly from small amounts of image data. We show that by increasing the amount of training data by only a small amount, we can substantially reduce the error of the trained networks in three data sets. This shows that our system is able to learn the fine details of a given data set with a minimal amount of data that can be provided by an individual.\n\nThe paper has been peer-reviewed and published in the proceedings of NIPS 2017.

    "This paper introduces a deep learning-based method to realize an automatic head overcoat thickness measurement that is accurate, repeatable, and free of human bias. Unlike typical measurements in which users may need to place the marker in the right position, rotate the head properly, and adjust for the correct measurement scale, our newly developed system takes just a straightforward front view picture as an input. In contrast to the conventional overcoat thickness measurement, our proposed design does not use marker, calibrate light, or adjust for the proper viewing angle. Moreover, the thickness is measured in an accurate, repeatable, and free of human bias manner, with a resolution and accuracy of 0.1 and up to 0.5 % in terms of the thickness variation, respectively. Although many machine learning-based systems were already proposed, our proposed Head Overcoat Thickness Measurement (HOCM v2) system showed much improved performance and superior performance against existing systems. Therefore, HOCM v2 is superior to existing manual and machine learning-based systems when taking a front view picture without an additional device as an input.\n\nYou can read the following research paper in its entirety here.",

    "It always amazes me how Disney, of all places, continues to push the envelope when it comes to Cinderella stories. I never thought, for example, that I would see a Disney Cinderella story about a woman who gets kicked out of her job solely because she's pregnant. But I did. And then after I saw that movie, I got the idea in my head that I'd never see another movie this good. Turns out, I've seen better.\n\nCinderelmo is a Disney Cinderella story, and it's about a female superhero named Cinderelmo who makes her money by making jewelry for ladies all over the world. When a villain named Prince Stealio (Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson) attacks Cinderelmo and steals all her jewels, Cinderelmo must overcome huge odds to stop Stealio, find the jewels, and become the hero that the people of her home country, Belice, deserves.\n\nThere are plenty of other Cinderella stories out there that are just as good as this one. If you're looking for a Disney princess film that has a girl who rides horses and is an amazing dancer, then this is not the Cinderella story for you, as it clearly has none of those elements. But if you are looking for a film about a girl who goes crazy and tries to find her true worth, then this is probably the best Cinderella story I can recommend.\n\nThere are three major characters in every Disney Cinderella story. First there is Cinderelmo, who is essentially the main Cinderella in every story from here on out. I wouldn't say that this is a unique take on the character by any stretch of the imagination. I've seen films that have Cinderellas go from princess to princess or from princess to princess in the span of a few seconds, so I wouldn't be surprised if this is also a similar thing going on here. Second is the Prince, who is supposed to be the main reason why Cinderelmo becomes the woman she is. In this story, the Prince is mostly a bumbling fool. There are times where we get to see him as a serious and smart guy, but there are more times in this Cinderella where",

    "> Ok. So long story short, I have eczema since forever. For the past 3 months. No one could determine what triggered it in my body, because eczema can be very tricky and can be caused by many things. This is the first time I've heard of getting an exzema flare up from a vaccine though. Last night I had my 1st Pfizer Covid vaccine, and this morning I woke up and found my face all red, burning, itchy and dry! The only times this has happened before, is when I ate a certain food or when some environmental factor triggered it. However for the past 3 months I went through many tests, skin consult and all sorts of treatments and found nothing specific to trigger a flare up! Does any of you think it could've been the vaccine?! Has anyone experienced this? Thank you in advance",
    "The structural support vector machine (SSVM) is a variant of the support vector machine (SVM) that can incorporate the inherent structure(s) of the training data and has many appealing properties. It includes a number of widely used supervised classification learning model s, such as logistic regression and the isotropic support vector machine. However, unlike the fast and scalable cutting plane version of the (unstructured) SVM, the structural SVM is known to suffer from an exponential runtime with respect to the number of training data points. To address this issue, Bian et. al. (COLT, 2016) recently proposed a projected Frank-Wolfe algorithm for solving the structural SVM, assuming an efficient subroutine called max-oracle, which for a single constraint in the structural SVM, can query the maximum value of the objective function of the associated constrained optimization problem. In practice, the max-oracle is in general hard even for small problems. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, AMP-FWA, which can solve the structural SVM without having the luxury of using the (expensive) max-oracle. The efficiency of our algorithm lies in the use of a multi-plane block-coordinate design. Using linear and quadratic programming, the efficiency of our algorithm depends only on the number of constraints, independent of the number of data points, while the number of support vectors does not enter the complexity. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms in a set of experiments where the max-oracle is replaced by an approximation, based on the randomized KKT algorithm.",

    "> > In this paper, we present Convolutional Random Walk Networks (CRWN), a new semantic segmentation architecture. Random Walk (RW) is a powerful machine\n> > learning framework that is very effective in modeling relational data such as graphs and images. It can capture the topological structures, local as well as global features of the graph by performing parallel random walks on graph. However, a major limitation of RW is that it is unable to capture the local information and is not invariant to local deformations. To address this problem, we propose a new model that enables CRWN to learn high level node features using the global and local features of the nodes. This is done by adding a novel convolution layer to the RW model, which we refer to as Convolutional Random Walk Network (CRWN). Experimental results on different benchmark datasets such as PASCAL-Context, Cityscapes, Stanford 2D and PASCAL VOC2012 demonstrate that CRWN is a state-of-the-art approach in the area of semantic segmentation.\n\nSource: http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00478v1\n\nFor other articles related to convolutional neural networks, random walks and their intersection:",
    "Background: Polyps are one of the most common benign lesions in the gastrointestinal tract of the colon, with the risks of the polyp becoming malignant being directly related to their size. Computer-aided detection (CAD) of colorectal polyps can mitigate the risks in a more accurate and efficient way. This research describes an approach based on image mining and the analysis of polyps that used a multi-feature classifier and an ensemble learning framework to localize colon polyps in standard colonoscopy images. The classifier was trained with feature sets extracted from the entire image and its different regions. We proposed an Ensemble Learner based on classifier confusion matrix, named Confusion Matrix Ensemble Learning (CMeL).\n\nApproach: The CMeL framework was created for polyp localization by collecting predictions from different ensembles: Ensemble (E), Bagging Ensemble (BE) and Hybrid Ensemble (HE). Different combinations of the three ensembles were used to form four different types of the CMeL framework. For the selection of the best ensemble for a frame, we proposed a selection process that was based on the confusion matrix. For the polyp localization, we used the comprehensive learning particle swarm optimisation (cpso), to determine the optimal polyp location in order to overcome the limitations of the bounding box. Furthermore, we proposed a feature ranking algorithm to select the feature set.\n\nKey Results: Experimental results were obtained over the publicly available multi-centre Muenster Polyp Database, and the dataset was divided into training and test sets. The proposed approach in ensemble learning based on classifier prediction confidence obtained 7.29% improvement, compared to the best baseline approach in the literature (96.36% vs. 89.07%). For the ranking algorithm, it improved the results of the classifier by 2.48%. For the localization of the CPSO, it improved the detection results by 2.49% using the ground truth and by 1.68% using the confidence-based approach to detect polyp.\n\nConclusions: We",
    "> We present a deep learning semantic segmentation method applied to an efficient cluster initialization on 3D point clouds data. A K-means clustering is performed after a previous semantic segmentation of the point cloud data. The goal is to find the optimal initialization for the cluster centers with a semantic segmentation in order to improve the speed convergence of the K-means clustering algorithm. A deep learning semantic segmentation approach of a point cloud data is developed with the 3D U-net model. In the training stage, the supervise method used is similar to the method used in the 2D. In this way, we will use the semantic segmentation output. We will also compare our semantic segmentation of point clouds data with state-of-the-art approaches.\n\nTo get the full document of this research paper, see this page on arxiv.org.\n\nIf you’re interested in AI Hardware, and want to know about the latest innovations and upcoming conferences, sign up for our weekly AI Hardware newsletter.

    "TLDR - We need more critical thinking skills when we deal with internet sources, otherwise we are just being fooled.\n\n\"I researched it on the internet\" is a valid basis for an argument or opinion.\n\n(My background has been in IT and management, but it is an argument I see as valid)\n\nIt may be that there is little to support or discredit a point of view, but even that is in itself an argument.\n\nWhen discussing a topic with people, whether that's about technical things, politics, economics, you often get stuck in a battle of the googles. \"I googled it, it says it here, it's so, so\" versus \"no it's not, I googled here, read this, it's so, so\".\n\nAs you could have guessed, it gets very heated and arguments soon emerge. \"I googled harder than you\" is another common sentiment, along with \"google it correctly.\"\n\nWell first of all, we should have very low expectations of what we can find on the internet. If people are using very dubious sources it makes a big difference. But even that I think is an interesting point of view - we probably shouldn't be accepting something as proof if the argument relies on a dubious source, but it doesn't necessarily discredit the argument itself\n\nOne of the problems I see, however, is this. The internet is huge. It's growing. In fact, the rate at which new information arrives on the internet is growing. In principle, you could have someone on one end saying \"I did more research than you, I'm correct, you're incorrect\" when in reality it's more likely that both arguments are correct, just from the two different points in time at which the search happened.\n\nThis is why most studies on the subject come to the conclusion that the amount of research is not a proof in itself, unless it's about certain topics where there is significant consensus on how to gather the information. (eg. medical studies are all very similar in how they gather evidence, so the total number of studies will be an indication of the validity of the conclusions).\n\nBut even then, on topics that",
    "A segmentation is an assignment of pixels to sets or regions. Segmentation of digital images is an important problem with real-world applications that range from security to image editing. A key step of a segmentation is to decide or estimate how many regions is the actual number of pixels the image be divided into. In this paper, we propose a new framework that uses a population-based multiobjective optimization to divide images into a given number of regions k. The key contribution of this work are four nature inspired algorithms and a new evaluation method are presented. They are: (i) Bees, (ii) Grasshoppers, (iii) Shuffled Frogs Leaping and (iv) Dragonflies. The effectiveness of the algorithms is evaluated for various benchmark images using the metrics used for multiobjective optimization. The results suggest that the Bees and Grasshoppers are the best performing algorithms, among this group of algorithms. These algorithms are then used to address the multi-threshold k-means clustering problem where the best method is selected through comparison to the state-of-the-art solution, i.e. k-means-X. It is demonstrated that the Bees and Grasshoppers perform as well as k-means-X for the tested images.",

    "Line spectral estimation (LSE) has a variety of applications,\nincluding geodesy, oceanography, seismology, and medical imaging.\nIt is commonly accomplished using estimation algorithms based on\nthe maximum likelihood principle that require a complete dataset: a\nset of all $N$ observations $x_1,\\ldots,x_N$ for LSE. However, using\nsuch data-complete algorithms in scenarios with sensor networks may\nbe prohibitively expensive: for example, transmitting the entire $N$-\ndimensional array of observations to a single processing unit. In\nthis work, we consider the line spectral estimation problem when the\ndata is not completely available.\n\n   Inspired by the gridless sparse methods we developed in a\nprevious work (Yang, et al. 2016), we explore the problem of LSE for\ncomplete, sampled, and missing data with sparse random matrices\nusing matrix norm maximization. We show that the matrix norm\nmaximization LSE approach generalizes the gridless sparse methods\nand extends naturally to the case with general missing and sampled\ndata.

    "I have this friend who took Lexapro for years and a year ago she decided to get off of it. When she was on it she felt much more calm and not as \"up and down\" as she felt off it. (Also she has Borderline Personality Disorder and thought Lexapro really helped with her mood swings) After a year of \"just being herself\" she seemed quite depressed and seemed to become much more suicidal, which I was worried about. Now Lexapro blocks the serotonin transporters, and therefore your brain doesn't know how much serotonin it has. Therefor my thoughts are that after being on it for so long, her brain has had trouble \"really feeling emotion\" because it wasn't really used to the ups and downs, and she just learned how to cope with Lexapro. I did find this: \"We propose that the SERT down-regulation, which is a secondary effect of SSRI treatment, might lead to depression after discontinuation of the drug because SRI-induced decreased SERT could enhance the development or maintenance of mood or anxiety disorder\" (found here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20033509).

However, if your baseline was calm and you had less ups and downs than most, then it could be that the Lexapro was \"restraining\" your serotonin and you aren't feeling emotions in a calmer way.

    "Axiom A polynomial skew products of C^2 and their postcritical sets\n\nY. Liu, Cheng-Yu Xu, F. Zheng, and S. Huang\n\nDept. of Mathematics 2017, Hua Qiao University, Quanzhou, Fujian, China\n\nThe aim of this article is to study the shape of postcritical sets of polynomial skew products. Especially, we find several examples which show the postcritical sets may not be contained in any proper closed disk or the postcritical sets may be connected. In addition we also study the degree of those examples and some of them may have arbitrarily large degree.\n\nIt is a rather peculiar fact that many articles regarding Julia sets for parameterizations of the Lorenz attractor (even the papers containing pictures of Julia sets) fail to mention an obvious connection between the Lorenz attractor and a non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical system: namely a linear skew product with unstable and stable directions. Let's start with a quick review of what a skew product is and then consider what kind of skew products the Lorenz attractor can fall into.\n\nWhen doing complex dynamics there are two types of skew products that one regularly encounters: namely quadratic polynomial skew-products and rational function skew products.\n\nThe quadratic polynomial skew product is of the form $F(z_1, z_2) = (2z_1 + \\frac{c_1}{z_1} z_2, z_2)$ where $c_1$ is a parameter. It's non-degenerate stable directions are the $x^*$-axis and the $y$-axis, while its non-degenerate unstable directions are the two lines $x = \\pm i y$. You can think of it as a perturbation of a hyperbolic linear skew product: $F_c(z_1, z_2) = (2z_1 + z_1 (z_2), z_2)$\n\nThe rational function skew product is of the form $F(z_1, z_2) = (\\frac",

    "> Abstract\n>\n> We present a novel approach to the problem of beam combining in optical communication systems. Our approach is based upon a multi-moded waveguide (MMWG) with a central (n+k)'th order mode, which is surrounded by a set of n orthogonal (n+1)'th order modes. This concentric arrangement of modes is realized by means of an optical ring resonator with a radial variation of both waveguide width and optical distance. Optical communication using our approach is based on the combination of information in a central mode with the information in the ring set of modes. These modes are mutually orthogonal, with the result that the ring set of modes operates in the polarization basis defined by the central mode, which in turn offers the advantage of independent polarization control for each of the output beam's propagation directions.\n\nThe original reference is from the journal Physica E, entitled \"Optics 6. Multi-moded concentric ring guiding structure for polarization optics\"",
    "> I’ve been hooked by cycling and I love it\n\n> I’ve been commuting by bike for most of the last year but I’ve recently really gotten into it. I used to take my bike to the metro station and leave in the morning and then get it from the metro station in the afternoon. It was an ok commute but it wasn’t until I got my own wheels, and realized how much more I like biking, that this really started to take off.\n\n> I realized I could bike to work so I started checking out the Google Maps route planner to see how much of it was bikeable and how fast my ride would be (the fastest was about 17 minutes). I was going to take up the challenge of doing it 4 out of 5 days, and on the 5th day I’ll just take the metro in the morning.\n\n> I’ve been biking to work for a week now and I love it. I’ve never been so happy to do something in the morning. It’s only 17 minutes but I get so psyched when I get to my office that I think my boss needs an apology for the energy increase I am throwing at him in the morning just because I bike. (Also: He has an awesome office with my dream bike in front of it!)\n\n> My morning commute is 17 minutes, which is just the perfect amount of time to get my blood flowing, work up a sweat, but not be so tired that I’ll have to nap when I get to work. It also makes it so that I wake up at a more natural time. I really try not to sleep in and set my alarm at a time where I’ll wake up normally and I usually succeed, mostly because my bike gets me up early and ready to do something. That’s all. It really is.\n\n> My commute back home is a lot longer, usually about an hour, which doesn’t sound great on paper. But it’s actually pretty great because it gives me time to unwind from the day, or think about stuff, or listen to music, or just let my mind wander. There are so many more opportunities for distractions on",
    "> Weakly supervised image segmentation has attracted increasing attention due to its broad applications. Recent years have witnessed the development of more and more deep networks for weakly-supervised segmentation. However, some of them usually require a long training time to get satisfactory segmentation accuracies, while the others have limitations in terms of accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose the concept of saliency guided to overcome these two issues. Specifically, we combine saliency guided feature learning with multi-modal information integration to enhance our semantic segmentation network. First, the saliency maps are generated via a modified Faster R-CNN (Mask-RCNN) and then served as guidance for training our network to extract more discriminative features. Furthermore, we design an attention module to extract richer semantic features from a combination of multi-modal information. Compared with the Mask R-CNN that is trained in fully supervised mode, our network can achieve similar accuracy with only one-fifth of the training time. Moreover, experiments on the Cityscapes dataset show that our method achieves better performance than state-of-the-art semi-supervised/weakly supervised/fully supervised models.",
    "Bram Stoker's Dracula is a brilliantly-imagined epic of horror and fantasy. The acting and set design are excellent. The movie is based on the novel of the same title. The novel was published in 1897, and the author, Bram Stoker, was an Irishman. The movie depicts the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nThe heroine of the story is Mina, a beautiful blond actress. She has been in love with Jonathan Harker, a medical school student and son of Mina's aunt. Their love blossoms. Meanwhile, Jonathan moves into Harker House, a castle on the moors. On one stormy night, something awakens in the castle. Jonathan realizes that what haunts him is Dracula, the legendary bloodsucker. As he tries to leave the castle, he is attacked and nearly killed by Dracula's men.\n\nMina goes to Dracula to find out what happened to Jonathan. She meets the count face to face and is amazed that he is the famous aristocrat, Lord Arthur. After finding out that he is Dracula, Mina tells him Jonathan will be coming to her house. Mina is the first to see Dracula after he has transformed into a beast, but even after he has killed Jonathan, Mina's love for him has not diminished. Jonathan had been a virgin, but now Dracula had stolen his innocence and he was forced to take what had once been his.\n\nThe novel can be read online (the novel is public domain).",
    "Cayley's toric variety $M_{n,d}$ for generic $n$ and $d$ has the\nstructure of a Gromov-Hausdorff limit of a sequence of pointed\nprojective toric varieties. Here we develop an analogous notion of\nGromov-Hausdorff limit for marked complex toric varieties.\n\nAs particular cases we construct two new Gromov-Hausdorff limits for the unit balls in the sequence of vector spaces over\nthe finite field $F_{q^n}$: the Grassmann variety $Gr_{n,d,q}$ and the flag variety $C(n,d,q)$ that contains the $r$-fold Veronese\nembedding of the projective space $P^d$ for any $r \\leq {n \\choose d}$. The first limit turns out to be compact, while the\nsecond is non-compact but locally compact and complete. Moreover, the Grassmann variety can be identified with a toric variety\nwith rational Ptolemy equations, while the flag variety contains as a subvariety the toric variety arising from the linear\nprogramming problem of minimizing $x_0 + x_1 + \\cdots + x_n$ on the vectors\n$(x_1,\\ldots,x_n,\\tilde x_1,\\ldots,\\tilde x_{\\tilde n})$ over the finite\nfield $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ that satisfy $x_j+\\tilde x_j=1$.

    "> Semantic segmentation is one of the primary vision problems in robotics. Previous works have largely focused on segmenting objects into regions sharing a same semantic category, making it difficult to obtain an accurate representation of object boundaries. In this paper, we present an incremental approach to class discovery for semantic segmentation, where a coarse global segmentation is first obtained and regions are then iteratively broken down into smaller ones under supervision to generate a finer segmentation. Our method leverages depth information from RGBD sensors, using an occlusion-based measure to discover segmentation boundaries from a single RGBD image. The approach utilizes an efficient class discovery strategy with a fully-connected neural network with deep supervision to incorporate RGBD information. We also introduce a method to learn color and depth embedding that utilizes deep convolutional networks trained on the COCO and SceneNet datasets, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our incremental class discovery method significantly improves the performance in challenging scenarios such as boundary detection and outdoor scenes.

We consider the case where each vehicle can use one of two lane-changing rules, following the preceding vehicle in the left lane, or not changing lane. We develop sufficient\nconditions for these locally nonlinear systems of differential equations to be stable in the mean square in the class of locally absolutely continuous random\nmeasures. We also develop a non-trivial equilibrium distribution for these systems, and derive estimates for the first two moments of the traffic.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThe author is grateful to Arup Mallik and Arup Mondal for helpful discussions, and to the reviewers for providing invaluable insights and suggestions.\n\nKeywords",
    "> Background subtraction is a useful technique for foreground object detection in video sequences. The classical technique is to assume a static camera and a static background. The foreground is estimated as the difference between frames. This is a simple and very intuitive method but it does not work properly under dynamic conditions. Under these circumstances, it is common to resort to a more sophisticated background building algorithm, in which the scene is modelled using a mixture of Gaussians. These models are very difficult to deal with when the number of unknowns (number of Gaussians that compose the scene) is higher than the number of observations (size of the sequence). Thus, it is not possible to update the mixture coefficients using the standard batch update. Also, it is not possible to use batch update when the sequence is real-time and the computation must be made incrementally. Under this context, this paper presents a probabilistic framework that allows, in the case of real-time sequence processing, to estimate a video sequence from a high-level model description using only a low-amount of observations. The algorithm is composed of two different processes. The first one is a model construction process which, given a probabilistic video model description and a low-amount of frame observations, updates both the model coefficients and the model description. The second process is an automatic model description inference. Here, a probabilistic video model interpretation is used to find the more appropriate model size and the initial values for the different parameters.\n>\n> The algorithm presented in this paper is a generalization of an algorithm that was previously described in a previous paper [1]. Here, the probabilistic framework that allows the algorithm to deal with real-time processing has been refined and explained in more detail.\n\nThis isn't exactly self-contained textbook material, but it's a topic of obvious importance in tracking / 3D reconstruction work, particularly with multiple viewpoints.

You don't have to enjoy this movie just because is Leonardo DiCaprio in it.\n\nI just can't believe, that a bunch of white people can be so vulgar. The only thing this movie showed me so far was that, how awful and disgusting white people are. The only reason for that, is because of their own ignorance. If you are white, then you know what I am talking about. White people cannot be any further away from reality.\n\nI guess that's the reason why, they like to watch the lives of those, who are different than theirs. What happened to this country is that, all the immigrants have finally stopped running, so, now it's white people's turn to run. When I came to this country, the racism wasn't that prevalent as it is now, even for white people. There were a lot more racist people back then, and they were very vocal about it, so they used it as a kind of protection. People wouldn't mess with those.

After all, my friends were immigrants, and all they had to do was to come to this country, and they get everything without having to work a day of their lives.\n\nHowever, my guess is that the real reason for it is because, if the people they are running from, find them, they can't go to the authority for help, because the authority is on the other person's side.\n\nBut, now, the reality has shown to us what truly",

    "A Hierarchical Modeling of Multidimensional Data in Regularly Decomposed Spaces: Synthesis and Perspective, Leonid Zhukov, May 15, 2017\narXiv:1705.05484v1 [cs.MS]\nThe main result of this paper is the description for a family of model and algorithms for the Hierarchical Modeling of Multidimensional (H2M) Data in Regularly Decomposed Spaces (RD-spaces), a fundamental problem of multivariate, multi-label and multi-tag data science.\nIt is shown that the problem is general enough to unite and combine many of the main ideas of hierarchical Bayesian models and hierarchical dimension reduction for structured data, as well as several algorithms for processing relational data and some of machine learning methods. The proposed model is defined in an exact and precise manner. The model is general in essence and its application has a wide range of possible applications. It is shown that the model can be used for generating and improving clustering trees and it can be used for calculating correlation distances on heterogeneous datasets, hierarchical clustering, etc.\nIn addition, this paper considers the problems of model complexity in an RD-space and presents two approaches to the solution. The first approach is based on dimension complexity estimation and the second one solves the same problem by constructing an effective index. A heuristic algorithm is proposed for constructing an index using various measures of the index quality. It is shown that the proposed algorithm improves the time-space trade-off for a family of multidimensional data mining problems like multidimensional clustering, multidimensional K-nearest neighbor selection problem, correlation calculation and constructing a similarity measure on different heterogeneous datasets.\nThe research has been done using the data from the Internet in the same way as the original Big data research was done.\nLabels: artificial intelligence, Bayesian analysis, big data, data science, Internet of things, research",

I also know there isn't a \"main\" conservative outlet, whether it be a magazine, or website, but it is still an important topic to talk about.

    "Today a few people were talking about their favorite albums and one of them brought to my mind an album I thought I'd lost. You see my old hard drive died in 2009 and took a lot memories with it. My high school years and a small part of my college years were destroyed. In that drive I had all of my favorite pictures from all of high school and college and every piece of writing I did in high school and the first two years of college that I wasn't too embarrassed by.\n\nThe thing that makes me nostalgic is that I really miss having those songs from that time. It was an album that my friends and I decided to make for the sole purpose of reminiscing about that time of our lives. There were a lot of funny songs in there. It was our time capsule to the past. If anyone has a copy of it. Please contact me. I'd really appreciate it. I've been trying to put it back together the last three years.\n\nOn the Reddit.com page, hundreds of messages offered condolences and help finding the album. Users suggested searching files by the words \"album,\" \"time,\" and \"memory.\" Several users offered the names of their first cars (a 1986 Mazda RX-7) and apartments (a one-bedroom apartment in a garden complex just off of St. Clair). One user offered a clue, which the Redditor decided was too subtle to respond to but was eventually discovered: \"If I remember correctly in the middle of the song _Boom, Boom, Boom_ when we change to the part of the song that talks about all our dreams of being older, our lead singer, Kevin, adds in something about the girls on our block.\"\n\nSeveral people said they could find no such album with that name, others found a possible lead, and some sent private messages, including copies of the relevant sections of CDs they owned. One person said that they had made a copy when they were younger and would be happy to send a copy to the Redditor. Several people offered to send old VHS tapes containing video from high school yearbooks.\n\n\"It took a while but we found it,\" the Redditor said, in his last comment. \"Thanks for all your help. It was a lot of fun reading about everyone's memories, even if I still couldn't hear",
    "\"Consider a real polynomial P(x,y) of degree > 2 with a critical point at the origin, and a positive irrational number. It follows from a simple computation that the origin is the only periodic point of P^n. In this paper we give conditions on the geometry of the postcritical set of P to ensure that this situation does not occur in higher degrees. In particular we obtain families of polynomials with the property that for any integer n their iterates do not reduce to the trivial dynamics in the polynomial coordinates, for any choice of an initial point.\"\nThis abstract has two points of interest, the first of which is \"consider a positive irrational number\". By definition, a \"positive irrational number\" is an irrational number strictly greater than zero. This is of course also true of the golden mean φ which is a special case of irrationality. However it is curious that, in order to get a dynamic result which uses the golden mean specifically, the research was published as an abstract instead of a full paper.\nThe second point of interest regards the \"simple computation\". This computation is essentially the well known method for finding the fixed point of a polynomial of degree one, and is the result by which a geometric condition on a polynomial is translated into a fixed point at some location. The problem with the golden mean is that when applied to the golden mean itself, this method fails. This point is well known by mathematicians but of more general interest is the fact that this method fails to find the fixed point of any polynomial with integer coefficients. In this sense, the failure to find a fixed point using this simple method actually has some validity, as finding a fixed point for a polynomial with integer coefficients is far from being \"simple\".\nAxiom A as an Alternative to the Axiom of Choice.\nAxiom A is often used as an alternative to the continuum hypothesis, and it is also used in the literature as a proof that the Axiom of Choice is equivalent to the statement that the integers are countable. An example by J. W. H. Stevenson demonstrates that this equivalency does not hold for Axiom A. The example is a partial ordering of the reals which is well founded under Axiom A but not under the Axiom of Choice.\nIt is helpful to see both of these examples",

    "I've recently made a move from a friend group I'd known for around 3-4 years, and was comfortable and quite familiar with as I transitioned out of university into a \"real adult job\". I'd been making friends with both college peers as well as people a few years older with careers, and had a diverse network of people to hang out with at any time. My first out-of-state move as an adult has been a bit of a downer for social life; while I moved closer to my immediate family for reasons of familiarity and wanting a stable base of support (I'm in a new country and I don't have my extended network of friends from back home), I ended up in an area where my extended family primarily lives, but where I don't know anyone otherwise, and I don't have any close friends I can hang out with on a regular basis.\nThe place where I've moved to is very nice; it's a small town with a friendly welcoming vibe. The place has a number of amenities, a good vibe, and I'm sure that it would be a great place to settle down and enjoy life at some point. At the same time, at this point in time it doesn't feel like the right place to me. It feels a little too small, a little bit too far removed from major cultural hubs, and the people seem a little bit on the small side. Perhaps the reality is that I'm not used to small towns, and I miss the larger vibe from a city. I definitely do consider myself an out-going individual, but I don't see other people going out regularly, and it's just that my work schedule involves a lot of overtime and I don't really have much time to go out and meet people. In my old town, I used to frequently take the opportunity to visit local cafes and drink coffee, and spend the rest of the day in the local coffee shop, with my laptop next to my coffee, and chat over a few people (including the people I'd meet) I'd find on public wifi. This was a great place to meet people casually, and I've missed that ever since my move.\nI find myself at a loss of what to do next.",
    "There is a misconception that cats naturally fight with each other. This isn't true, cats that live together can get along harmoniously if kept together as kittens – after that the balance of the cats is upset so each cat will fight for dominance at every opportunity. It will result in bloody noses and a general lack of harmony. The best solution is to not to get several cats unless you are prepared to keep them in separate locations (or are prepared to be a slave to your cats).\nThe ideal number of cats is usually one, or just two. There are other things that help. Get your cat some things to amuse it to let it keep busy. Get it a big box of cat toys. Cats love to hunt mice so get some stuffed toys shaped like mice. Put catnip on them for even more fun. Cats love catnip. If you aren't sure whether or not your cat likes it, let it smell before you offer it.\n\n# References\n\n[1] Reddit. 2015.

    "As my title suggests, I believe spotify is doing something very deliberate to get people to upgrade to premium. I will preface my post with the fact I really wish I didn't have to upgrade to premium, but I'm a college student so it's just not an option for me.\nAs a free user, I use spotify primarily to listen on my ipod touch when I'm on campus doing work. I only ever listen on my computer on campus for the music visualizer it provides. In the past I would rarely notice a commercial so I thought maybe they didn't exist as part of the free user version. Today, however, I decided to use spotify via desktop to listen to a few songs while I worked. After about 15 minutes and over 6 commercials, I noticed they were all for the exact same app: Yousician. To make matters worse, the first 5 were exactly consecutive. I'm sure some of you may not know what Yousician is, but it offers to teach you to play guitar through guided lessons. Not a huge fan of the price, but I can't say I'm totally against it.\nI know there's probably just an exceptionally large amount of advertisements for the service. Not to mention I am a college students working on a college computer. However, if I can make one assumption, it's that I am probably the intended target to make the upgrade. I was going to make a complaint through the app but I figured I would first post this for more insight as to what everyone else thinks.\nEdit: As per some suggestions, I'm going to try to see if the ad frequency lessens over time. So far, the first half of my set is still Yousician ads, but it seems like there may be a few other kinds of ads mixed in here. This probably means nothing conclusive, but if we can't find anyone else that has had this happen, we may need to find a way to get our voices heard.\nI will continue to update my thread as to how frequently the ads come in the beginning of my set, but I'm leaning more towards that it just really is a bad day for spotify ads. This certainly seems plausible given everyone else's opinions.\nI've never encountered this sort of thing. This may be related to your specific usage, though",

It is no classic but it is above average as you can expect from this genre of film and I give it a decent rating. I thought the acting was okay, I suppose with this type of role it is difficult to know how to act but it is alright. The pacing is decent and the soundtrack is okay, if anything I guess I would say that the direction is decent. The movie is not bad and I enjoyed seeing it, I feel like I can justifiably give it a positive rating. I do like movies about sports, they are a good way to be entertained and I enjoy seeing underdogs do well as we can look at them as inspirations and they win in life and not just on the court. I think that the movie \"Blue Chips\" is the best sports movie about basketball that I have ever seen and this movie was decent but it should not be compared to the classics, which is probably why I rated it a little lower, this movie is a decent film which is a good attempt at covering a real sports story and it is worth seeing on occasion.

    "\"Left Ventricle (LV) segmentation is important for clinical imaging to estimate LV volume using cardiac magnetic resonance angiography (cMRA) images. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have succeeded in performing LV segmentation using the whole 3-D MRIs. Deep learning models, however, require the training of a large number of MRIs. To overcome such a drawback, the authors propose to train a DCNN model using segmentation maps generated by the first slice from 3-D MRIs. They show that this technique is efficient when segmenting cMRA images to estimate LV volumes. It is an extension of their previous study using deep forests, and adopts hybrid forests and deep forests as the segmentation models. This experiment used cMRA images of patients with cardiac diseases acquired from six medical institutions.\"\nSo basically, they are saying that DCNN's can be trained using only the first slice from 3D MRI images for the purpose of LV segmentation.\nMy question is does this also apply with MRV's? For example would it be possible to train your DCNN using only the first cine from the 3D MRV imaging sequence for the purpose of LV segmentation?\nIs there even a reason to do so?\nI feel like all the information required for DCNNs is already present in the first frame and thus would lead to potentially lower accuracy when compared to the whole volume (3d) image set.\nThe only reason I would want to do this is because I am short on time and I have many more cine sets than 3d data sets, so it would be beneficial to me if DCNN training could be applied to only the cine data set and not the 3d one.\nI want to try to create a model that would take the first frame and perform LV segmentation on the rest of the frames (the rest of the stack in cine vs 3d MRIs) using DCNN techniques.\nI have already seen many papers where similar experiments have been done on cine images but no one has done them on all cine images and I wanted a deeper understanding.\n#2 Re: Only first frame needed for DCNN training (LV segmentation)\nWe are working on solving the same problem, so your post is valuable!

    "### Abstract\n\nWe propose a novel curriculum domain adaptation framework to learn robust semantic nighttime image segmentation models in unlabeled target images. Motivated by the fact that the difficulty of the nighttime image segmentation task is largely due to the illumination changes from day into night, we first establish a mapping from day-night scenes via unsupervised visual feature learning, and show that the day-night image pairs can be mapped into one unified space through unsupervised visual feature learning. The mapping is leveraged to build a map-guided curriculum domain adaptation module for the segmentation network, which learns the adaptive segmentation of the target images in both the day and the night. We also present a novel uncertainty-aware image-to-image translation paradigm, by employing uncertainty to regularize the image-to-image translation models and segmenting the nighttime images with day lighting conditions with high confidence. Further, to address the domain shift introduced by nighttime images in unlabeled targets, the uncertainty-aware image-to-image translation is combined with our proposed uncertainty-adaptive weighted loss function to achieve uncertainty-aware evaluation and nighttime image semantic segmentation. In extensive experimental studies, the proposed methods have been validated in multiple datasets, and are shown to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art.\n\n\n> ## [Crowd Counting](https://github.com/yorkerlin/pytorch-generative-model-collections/tree/main/papers-with-codes/crowd-counting)\n>\n> Papers and codes for counting persons\n\n> ## [Object Detection](https://github.com/yorkerlin/pytorch-generative-model-collections/tree/main/papers-with-codes/object-detection)\n>\n> Papers and codes for object detection\n\n> ## [Video Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/yorkerlin/pytorch-generative-model-collections/tree/main/papers-with-codes/video-anomaly-detection)\n>\n> Papers and codes for video anomaly detection.  \n> [PyTorch-Video-Anomaly-Detection](https://github.com/mahmoud/",
    "This is one of many biographical films made about famous sport figures. Some good examples are \"Raging Bull\", \"Jerry Maguire\" \"Million Dollar Baby\" and even \"Rocky.\". This is the life tale of boxer Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter. The movie is very well presented showing his life, how he met his wife and became a famous boxer at the same time. He is a contender for a World Championship title and it seems he has everything going for him until the day he is arrested and thrown into jail for a murder he didn't commit. He languishes in prison for years, losing his chance at the title, as well as his respect and relationship with his wife and children. It would take many years for him to prove his innocence and prove that the law enforcement was wrong.Many know the true story of \"Hurricane\" Carter. I have to say that this is one of those films that are hard to see but has to be shown anyway. It is the best performance Denzel has given and I can easily understand why he won an Oscar for his role. I think Denzel is deserving of an Oscar for this performance although many don't think so. It is also a powerful drama that is worth seeing. Denzel did a great job portraying a wrongfully accused individual without letting the audience feel any sympathy. He plays his role as a victim very well. His acting was truly outstanding and I can understand why everyone was talking about how much he deserved an Oscar.The supporting cast is very good. Forest Whitaker does an especially good job as his attorney. Famke Janssen, who plays his wife, gives an especially good performance. She is given a very emotional role and at times even tears up when she sees him in the position he is in. She is a sympathetic and warm person and it is a shame that they couldn't be together. Ingrid Munch, who plays his daughter, gives a very strong performance as a victim of her own mistakes. The supporting cast is very strong and each of them have their moments in this film.The movie is a true tribute to wrongfully accused individuals.

    "I've been watching pvp on my server very closely over the last hour and seen only one resister player, in fact I was so excited to see the resister that when I saw a bunch of drowns I made sure to find out if anyone had been resist capped and found them to be just normal mages. I have to say when I thought about it, and why I was so happy to see a resister capped player, it dawned on me that the resist cap system is doing very little for pvp other than making it less balanced. Since the devs decided to reduce the overall damage of elemental mages I've not really seen them in much in regards to actual pvp. Even back before the damage change I never seen them much in pvp. The reason why is because elemental mages are so incredibly easy to resist. You do not need to be a mage (in most cases) or use any abilities to resist. In fact, to even resist elemental mages you could have any class, be using no magic of any kind, be at lvl 1 and not be buffed or equipped with any magic resist shields or armor. In fact if anything it seems to just do nothing unless you're a mage your self.\nOn to the drowns, which are currently one of the most used pvp classes on my server.

    "A great idea and I thought the casting was great. The problem with this film is the length and timing. It hits you hard in the first 45 minutes then starts slowing down toward the end. It is an interesting movie but I'm not sure it deserved more than a two hour film. It just never recovered from the first 45 minutes of the film. I just wish the pacing had been better and the length had been shorter. It was a little too long for the ideas to be fully developed. Had the film been more about Ray and his family, I might have liked it better. The film had a very strange tempo and flow. The first scene had a really nice rhythm to it, but as it went on it just seemed to get out of control. The next scene had a good rhythm, but then the pacing just got out of control and the pacing just got faster and faster. I think it would have been okay if the film had been made into a two hour film, but it just didn't have the pacing or the style to make it work.

    "Consider the tradeoff between the stretchability property and the length of the shortest path in a geometric graph on $n$ points in the plane, with respect to a convex domain (called the stretchability tradeoff).  We show a result for the average case, where the points are chosen independently and uniformly at random in the convex domain.  More specifically, we provide the expected values of both the maximum stretch and length of the shortest path as a function of stretchability and then find bounds on these quantities in the worst case, when the points form convex configurations that maximize the stretch or the length of the shortest path.\n\nConsider a metric graph $\\mathcal{G} = (V,E)$ on $n$ points in the plane with length function $d$ with respect to the distance between points.

Let $\\lambda$ be a number larger than 1.

This is all due to a gigantic asteroid nicknamed \"The Flying Cow\" which crashes into the Earth and does a lot of damage.\nDuring all of this, the characters learn that to save the world, or at least the continent, they must all learn to get along, which they struggle to do in a silly scene where Scrat uses Manny's mammoth tusks as a harmonica. But they all become closer and decide to go to the South Pole, which is Manny's dream, the other two agreeing to go only so Manny doesn't leave them (this is what I find the most hilarious part of the film--three otherwise rational creatures who decide to give up life as they know it so that one of them can live out his fantasy).\nI have to say, the animation is spectacular. I don't know how they managed to create an entire, diverse new world underwater, but it's amazing. The character",
    "SSJBE plus Kaioken x20 Vegeta vs Ultra Instinct Goku?\nWhat do you guys think? Aren't they supposed to be at the same level?\nThere's more to this image (with further discussion) on Reddit.\nThe following is the full text of a post titled \"What do you guys think?\" from reddit.com:\nSo Goku's level of power and skill is still vastly superior over Goten's? I never noticed, but I haven't read the manga or the anime fully yet.\nGoten in this image looks like maybe 16-17 years old in some scans and other time periods like the Buu saga Goku was about 31-32. What are we to assume Goku's age is in this time period? Or do they actually still look like they are about the same age and therefore are still about on the same level? It's kind of confusing but I'd say Goten is clearly a good deal more skilled at combat than we have ever actually seen.\nI think Goten and Trunks look like they are around 15 when you take a good look. Goku is 29 in the Saiyans and Frieza arc. That's when the Z-Fighters show up and Goku goes SS4 to beat Frieza.\nIf Goten is 15, then Goku is probably more like 35 now, which is in line with his age in the Buu saga for starters since he fights Buu, Frieza and Cell all back-to-back.\nHe looks as if he's around 33 or 34, not 40 like in the Buu arc.\nAnd Goten looks way older than him. Goten was also in that tournament where he fought Nappa. So the SSJ3 forms and kaioken x20 are probably at his real power level and not boosted. Maybe I'm wrong though?\nIt was stated that Goten is a good deal older than him and got to SSJ3 before he did (because of his youth?) but that was never made clear. So I don't think it's a mistake that he would have caught up with Goku's age by now at least.\nTrunks seems to be closer in power to Goten than Gohan was.\nI think Goku went SSJ",
    "The story of the British officers T. E. Lawrence and Jack Hogge and the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Turks during the First World War.\nA movie which is considered to be one of the best movies ever made, \"Lawrence of Arabia\" is a classic which should not be missed by any of those who enjoy the movies.\nThe film had been rumored to be filmed back in the 1930s yet the war had created a problem for that. But the film was finally made in the 1960s with a huge budget.\nIt is based on actual events and is filled with historical facts. Not a single scene of the film is a fabrication.\nThe film features Peter O' Toole, Alec Guinness, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Harry Andrews and many other renowned actors.\nIn the film, T. E. Lawrence is the leader of the Arab Revolution who uses his ingenuity in gathering together various Bedouin tribes of Northern Arabia and forms a force to fight against the Turks. A member of the British military, he serves as a liaison officer for a mission to destroy the Turkish railroad which is providing support for the Ottoman Army.\nThe Arabian desert is well displayed in this epic tale. The beautiful photography and amazing scenery makes the film appear quite realistic.\nThe film is filled with violence not only from the fighting between the tribes of Arabia but also from the brutal Turkish troops.\nThe final destruction by Lawrence and his Arab forces of the Turkish railroad was said to have been inspired by actual events at the time.\nAs much as I recommend seeing this film, I give it only a 3 for it is a serious film and not one that entertains.\nLawrence of Arabia was directed by David Lean, who also produced the film with Sam Spiegel. It is based on the book \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\" by T. E. Lawrence. It was made in 1962.\nI will begin my review by saying that I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a high school when I was a sophomore. It was actually shown on a television screen with a teacher narrating parts of the film. In retrospect, it was probably too much history for me at the time. However, I am so glad I got to see this film in such a way on that big screen back then because I don't think I would have seen it",
    "I mixed 30mg hydrocodone with alcohol, need advice please.\nI live in the USA. I have my pain medication from a doctor. I'm not a heroin addict and I never wanted to get high off my meds. But about 5 months ago I had a very bad anxiety attack. I usually manage my anxiety and have things under control. But this was out of the blue, I was at work, things happened that stressed me out. I went home and could not calm myself down. I was shaking and sweating profusely. This is the time when I decided to take a hydrocodone to help relax me.\nI am not used to taking any pills for anything but my normal vitamins. I did nothing to prep my body for the opiate. I took three pills and fell asleep.\nI woke up 3 hours later and had a really bad headache. I could barely move, I felt awful. I could not focus for hours. This was not good. I was alone and scared.\nI decided that this medication was NOT for me, and I don't really need it. After my anxiety attack subsided I had no problem ever taking any of my pain meds again. I'm really not interested in being a drug addict, no offense. I just find it really hard with the way the pills were described to me.\nAnyways... I am not the type to try drugs because someone I know is. I'm a real stick in the mud about these things. But after this experience, I've wanted to try this again, to see if I would have the same reaction.\nThe same anxiety attack happened about a week ago. I ended up on the floor crying in pain, in some kind of a fit. I have since taken my first prescribed hydrocodone to try to bring the anxiety down.\nA couple of hours after I've taken the pill, my skin became really sensitive and itchy. I don't know why that happened. I used to be a hard drug addict, and I've had the worst drug rashes imaginable in my youth. I took another hydrocodone because I couldn't find anything else to try for the anxiety.\nMy second hydrocodone was two weeks ago today. A couple hours after taking the medicine my stomach started hurting something awful. I thought I was going to pass out",

    "I'm 28 and I live in my country (in Asia). I come from a rather traditional family, and grew up in a household with two parents who love me very much. They still have money, but it's not much – just enough for basic necessities. I'm the only child left in the family, since I'm an only son and my two sisters have moved away from the house to be with their respective husbands.\n\nUntil I was 17, my parents have always encouraged me to study hard and be a good son. After a bit of research, I realized that most of my family members who are doctors live abroad, but it never felt like pressure to get a career there myself, or so I thought.\n\nAbout two years ago, I graduated from college with good grades. I decided to leave the house and go abroad to work while doing an MSc programme.\n\nUnfortunately, I took out a student loan from my bank. I also got a temporary job there. However, I didn't have much savings, because most of the money I earned was spent on the student loan.\n\nOne day in the bank I accidentally bumped into my ex's girlfriend and she introduced me to her friend who was working in a local company. I was invited to go on a tour with them. We went to a few places, all nice and well-maintained. That's when I heard that they were actually from a \"cult\" in our country. It was the kind of organization where you were forced to quit your job, sell your belongings and move in; also a sort of family, but not one you choose or have much say in the arrangement.\n\nA few days later, I went back and became close friends with her. I started hanging out a lot and eventually fell deeply in love with her. She liked me back, but she decided that she wanted something more than a casual relationship and she wanted to move in with me. This was something I didn't want to commit to, but I started considering about how I could live with her without giving up my life abroad.\n\nAt first, I said no, but then we broke up and got back together many times, each time because of our unresolved feelings for each other. About a month or two later, I finally agreed to the idea of her moving in with me.\n\nThis",
    "A new diploma will take over from GCSE and A-level exams in England from 2014.\nThe education secretary, Michael Gove, said the diploma would give pupils a broad and balanced curriculum.\nBut teaching unions say there have been too many changes too quickly and the new tests are not ready.\nThe National Union of Teachers said ministers were \"hobbling schools with poorly conceived change\".\nMr Gove's Department for Education said the system would deliver a \"high level\" of basic skills.\nThe coalition government is planning reforms to the national curriculum and school assessment.\nNew secondary exams, to be known as the English baccalaureate and English language baccalaureate, will replace GCSEs, AS and A-levels in 2014.\nThey will be set and graded by external exam boards.\nBut the new diploma, which will take up around 10 hours of school time each week for the two-year courses, will also involve students showing they are making progress in key subjects outside exams.\nThat could be a dissertation, an exhibition, a written work for charity or a work experience placement.\nTeaching union NASUWT president Chris Keates said her members had \"serious misgivings\" about the introduction.\nThe NUT's general secretary, Christine Blower, said the plans were a \"brazen attempt to destroy state education\".\n\"We have heard that pupils have no GCSEs in literacy or numeracy because they were studying creative writing.\n\"Ministers have completely lost sight of what it is to have a proper education system.\"\nShe said the government should be worried about the falling standards in numeracy and literacy.\nShe pointed out that according to the National Curriculum assessment data for Year 6 pupils, the most recent figures, just over three-quarters (76%) of 11-year-olds reached the expected level for their age, with just 17% reaching a higher standard at that age.\nMr Gove said: \"This radical reform will put students at the heart of their education, give them the skills and knowledge to succeed in the modern world and restore rigour and substance to qualifications.\n\"By 2014 we will have introduced the most ambitious and rigorous curriculum for more than a century to ensure young people have the knowledge and skills to succeed in their future lives.\"\nThe government wants every",

This review was left by a customer who purchased the Dewalt DCS570B 20V MAX XR Brushless Compact Reciprocating Saw with 5.0Ah Battery:\nThe compact reciprocating saw is a powerful tool. It cuts with both the push stroke and pull stroke. It is able to cut 2 x 4 lumber at an angle with just one blow. Very portable saw. It came with two different kinds of bit. The saw works best with Dewalt blades. The saw comes with a battery, a charger and a tool box for the bits and a shoulder strap. A very good deal for this saw as it is worth $220 retail.\nThe following is a review taken from Amazon.com of the \"Xenon Headlights\" for the Toyota Tundra:\nThe light quality is great. Everything is very bright and white; I can actually see the road in foggy conditions. I had to order the parts to make the headlights work with the projector and HID but it wasn't very hard to do. I went to Autozone (just across the street from my house) and they were able to show me all the parts I would need for about $40. The hardest part for me was probably the wiring. It took me about an hour to rewire everything.

    "I am 29 now and i recently went to the er because I had a bad episode of anxiety. In the middle of seeing the doctor, I realized that i had never gotten in trouble with the police. I thought, \"I need to remedy that as soon as possible, this is embarrassing for me.\"\nSo I went and bought acid and I thought, \"Alright fuck it, if i'm gonna get busted for something, it might as well be drugs!\"\nI dropped some and waited by the mailbox so I could see who would be the first person to come by. Then I thought, shit, I can't just do drugs and do a drive by. It is too dangerous for everyone involved.\nMy house is in a fairly nice neighborhood but there are still plenty of sketchy characters walking around. I grabbed my skateboard and thought, \"Alrighty lets go, I'm gonna pretend I just dropped out of the sky onto a skateboard and I'm just cruising around town doing acid and I don't know what I'm doing.\"\nSo I skate on down the road then down a hill and I just let myself roll along. It worked great and I felt like I was flying. Everyone I passed gave me a weird look and thought I was a stoner and it was like I was invincible!\nThen I went through a field and then went off road. This one guy was driving a van on the road and we looked at each other and it seemed like he was gonna do something so i picked up my pace to try and avoid him. So I rode my skateboard down into a ditch and got all scratched up but I thought that was exciting. Then I tried to get back on the road and I fell down the other side. At this point I knew that if I tried to start skating again I would fall and then get killed by a car so I sat down cross-legged on the side of the road and waited to either die or fall asleep. I took a few hits of acid to keep myself awake.\nThe whole time I was waiting I thought, \"What if someone just drives down the road and hits me. When will I know? Will I see them or am I just gonna sleep and miss it?\" I looked at the stars and listened to the music in my head and wondered what it would be like to be a star.",
    "\"Deep learning (DL) based medical image segmentation frameworks have improved the performance remarkably. Though there exist a large number of variants for medical image segmentation, fully-convolutional (FC) networks based approaches such as U-Net have gained a wide acceptance. Unlike most CNNs, the layers in U-Net based architectures are of two types that help achieve this segmentation task: downsampling (also known as encoder) layers, that are responsible for coarse to fine prediction and upsampling (also known as decoder) layers, that are responsible for generating high-resolution segmentation masks with a detailed prediction. Recent works have further improved segmentation performance by using different types of fusion layers. However, designing such models for each dataset has been a challenge because each model requires a very high number of parameters and a very large training dataset. This necessitates the need for a framework, specifically designed for U-Net based architectures, that could be easily extended. nnU-Net is a self-adapting framework built on top of PyTorch and is primarily designed for medical image segmentation using U-Net. nnU-Net consists of a generalised model architecture, known as the nnU-Net model, which is highly extendable. Furthermore, nnU-Net also contains pre-trained models for 10 different medical segmentation tasks trained using nnU-Net. To demonstrate that nnU-Net is highly extendable, the framework is tested with three different variants of the nnU-Net model on the publicly accessible ISLES dataset. Experimental results show that nnU-Net performed very well for segmentation with an mIoU metric of 0.973. Also, nnU-Net provided a generalisable pre-trained model for the task. The source code and pre-trained model for nnU-Net is made available to researchers on GitHub.\"\n\nThe nnU-Net model architecture is discussed in this paper as an extension to U-Net's encoder and decoder. It is designed to incorporate different variants of FUSION layers.\nThe nnU-NET model is evaluated on the popular ISLES dataset. It does so well, that it is able to beat U-NET's baseline.\n\n# Table of Contents\n<!-- vim-markdown-toc GFM -->\n\n* [1. Getting Start",
    "People who refuse to recognize Biden as president, either because they believe that Trump still won the election and so they don't respect the results, and/or because they are supporting QAnon, etc., are likely to become even more involved in these movements. These movements can become more dangerous. I'd like to hear people's thoughts on this.\nBelow are some of the top posts from /r/UniteBlue in that topic. I've summarized them.\nLet me reiterate one thing I mentioned earlier but perhaps that wasn't clear enough; the danger to America comes from those who refuse to recognize Biden. It's not really the small minority of people who are still hanging onto Trump that much. Most of them are just ignorant, sad to say. It's the millions of former Trump supporters who have changed their minds and realized that Trump couldn't be trusted all along that I am worried about. A lot of them are starting to realize that perhaps they were deceived to begin with. And many of them are starting to get really angry about it.\nThis is the danger we're facing. It's the thousands of angry Trump supporters turning to QAnon, the Proud Boys, and the rest because they no longer believe Trump. The danger comes from those who refused to vote for Biden simply because they were on the Trump train. And once these people decide that they didn't vote for Biden because they were deceived, the danger is clear. The only reason we can even dream of getting over this is that people are still voting for Biden in droves. If that changes, the rest is history.\nI think the most important thing to do is to stay calm and not give in to their antics. I know that's easier said than done, but it's the only chance we have here. We have to stay calm and stay strong throughout this process, because there's no telling how tough it's going to be until we get there.\nI'm not a member of QAnon. But I do understand the feeling of having been deceived or lied to by those in power.\nI don’t support the Q cult. It’s not something I’m particularly interested in. Even if Q was a real person, that person would still be a bigot and",

This choice was not based on my desire or ability, but on my parent's wish. I knew that I was going back to school to go against my father's wish and his anger was evident. After graduating, I took a few years to relax before returning to job market. I used my time well to prepare myself better than most.\n\nThe reason I chose to go back to school was purely to defy my dad.

    "\"Recent developments in quantum computers and quantum information processing require a high-fidelity detection of single photons in a deterministic way at the single event level (1, 2). Photon detection based on time-of-flight is a well-known quantum optical technique (3). In this scheme, a single photon is launched into the input arm of a 50/50 beam splitter. Part of the photon state undergoes a random walk due to several reflections of the photon between the two output arms and is thus detected only with a certain probability. The arrival time of the photon can be determined by detecting the photon in one arm only. For example, a single-photon avalanche-photodiode (SPAD) is usually used to detect the photon after n reflections (n+1 measurements; maximum detection probability p = 1/2n+1 for the n-th round) (4), and the arrival time is determined by the time-of-arrival (TOA) of the n-th measurement. However, since a direct detection of the n-th bounce leads to a high dark count rate, single-photon avalanche-photodiodes are usually operated at low bias voltages and under cryogenic conditions for reducing the dark count rate, which limits the TOA resolution. It is therefore of great interest to detect single photons with an efficient timing detector [defined by the ratio between the arrival time resolution and the pulse width of the arrival time detector] for practical quantum photonic technologies, such as in quantum key distribution (QKD) (5–7).\nIn this work, an absolute TOA measurement with an efficient timing detector for quantum photonics based on the time-bin scheme (8) has been achieved by using a SPAD. The performance of the timing detector, which is realized with a time-correlated counting system, is characterized by measuring light pulses (at the 1.55 μm telecommunication C-band) produced by a pulsed vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser at a repetition rate of 80 MHz with a pulse width of 140 ps. The timing detector of the fiber-coupled SPAD shows an efficiency of 65% in an output fiber with an attenuation of 32.7 dB and an absolute TOA resolution of 2.6 ps (=0.3 × 140 ps). This value is sufficient not only for QKD systems but",

    "Hi, everyone. I'm a 19-year-old college junior living in the DC area. In addition, I also work full time as an intern (so this year will count as one of my experience for resume). As someone who's not from the DC area, I know that it's nearly impossible to find a job in this area as it has a tough market.\n\nI've always wondered, should I even try to find a job in DC? Maybe I should just give up the job and move back home to where I was raised in or relocate somewhere where there's less stress on the job. I see most of my friends from college already found a job and it's really hard to see my buddies get a job and I'm still stuck out here looking for a job.\n\nI know this is going to sound stupid, but I also can't stand to go home. I'll be living back in my parents house and it'll feel like I'm stuck in a teenage stage again. I just don't want this to be the end of my college life. I really don't feel like starting a family and working as a 9–5 worker. I just want to move out and have my own life. Please help me figure out something I can do. I will appreciate any advice. Thanks!\n\nWhat do you see in this post? Can you tell why this person is experiencing so much stress? Can you relate his thoughts to anything you know or have read about? Can you tell he's in a transitional phase of his life?\n\nYes, it's not uncommon to experience stress when life forces you to make a decision. But the stress this person's experiencing is not related to the job he seeks, or the decision to move back home, or even the possible decision to move somewhere else. This stress is all about what he just described in his post as \"the end of my college life,\" which is actually just one phase of life.\n\nThis man doesn't have a job, but he seems to know what he doesn't want. If he doesn't want to start a family and work as a 9–5 worker, he shouldn't worry much when he fails to find a job in the DC area, as that region isn't for everyone and not everyone is meant to live there.

    "\"Woman in Gold (2015)\nThis movie is a dramatization of a civil case that began in 1998, when Holocaust survivor Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren) initiated a campaign which culminated in Austria's Supreme Court ruling, in her favor, that the country had to pay her restitution for five Gustav Klimt paintings that she claimed Nazi officers stole from her.\nThe movie is a bit strange because the real Maria and her niece, Eunice Guthrie (Ryan Reynolds), are still living. They aren't ghosts, but they have the appearance of two ghosts appearing during the court proceedings. They are represented by a court-appointed attorney, Hubertus Czernin (played by Daniel Brühl). Czernin is a bit like a ghost as well because his name isn't quite correct (the real Czernin had left the court by the time Mrs. Altmann brought a case there), and he is a lot more of an American than a Austrian. I don't know why they couldn't get a real Austrian to play the role.\nCzernin is a sympathetic character. He's a bit too young to have a great deal of experience, but he proves to have enough drive to do what he can, and he does a good job. There's a bit of ambiguity concerning whether he has a crush on one of the defendants (Kloss). There's some speculation that he and his wife divorced, and Kloss is a good looking woman, but they don't even work together until the end of the trial, and then it isn't in court.\nHelen Mirren can do nothing wrong. And while she was at least 60 in the movie, she looks about half that. She really does have an astonishing level of talent. It makes the character of Altmann more bearable than she actually was. But I really don't think that much changed between 1998 and 2006, because even in the \"real\" trial, she was arrogant. Mirren doesn't portray her as a nasty person. I really think she did what she did because \"the Jews\" \"made it so. There was something about Austrian people, so it was a fair fight in her mind.\nA large portion of the movie is taken up by court scenes, although several scenes are set in the American Embassy.\nIf you haven't seen the",
    "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02191.pdf\nQuantitative Analysis on the Point-Centered Quarter Method\nAbstract: Existing quantitative methods of image matching, which are based on matching points, will lose information in the vicinity of the matched point. In this paper, we introduce the Point-Centered Quarter method, which is more convenient than the conventional Quantitative Assessment method. Our method has the advantage of evaluating the matching quality while preserving the local shape, and it can be extended to handle multiple points for evaluation. Our approach offers the advantage of preserving information in the vicinity of the matched point. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Point-Centered Quarter method, and the results are presented and discussed in the paper.\n1. Introduction: Image matching is the process of searching images with the same content that exist in different environments, view points, and/or camera positions [1]. Image matching is the process of finding identical objects in different images, which is of great significance for computer-aided design and computer graphics, especially when there are multiple views. It has become one of the most important image processing technologies in computer vision. When matching an image, it is necessary to measure the similarity and distance between images to evaluate the matching quality of the two images. Matching points are commonly utilized for quantitative image matching [1]. However, the evaluation of image matching requires more than a single point. For instance, in one image, there is only one point where two objects are identical, but in other images, there may be dozens of points with similar similarities and distances. In matching, how to obtain the best evaluation results from many objects is a problem. In general, the more points that can achieve this, the best is the result [2].\nThe quantitative evaluation of image matching has been studied since the invention of matching point evaluation method proposed by [1]. This method is a basic matching point evaluation algorithm, which is widely used in the matching point algorithm of multi-view matching. The author takes the matching points as the research objects and designs a set of evaluation points (points of interest) according to the matching point. The evaluation point is divided into four equal parts (upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right), i.e., the 4 neighborhood of the matching point. The matching point is the upper left",
    "When I was younger, I was always very introverted and a loner. I was definitely one of the shy, awkward kids at school. Nowadays, I've become a much better communicator, but even after all these years I still often seek out solitary activities/hobbies. There's an undeniable sense of joy/freedom in being a reclusive loner, because there are literally no obligations, demands, commitments or requirements for your actions. Every second you spend can be spent alone (this, of course, is only the case if your job isn't too demanding). There are also very little to no consequences for being alone for extended periods as a loner. If you do something weird/embarrassing in public and no one is there to witness it or tell anyone about it, you're good.\nEven when it comes to dating, people seem to think it's a perfectly normal thing to do, but I can't help but question the thought process. Theoretically, a lot of people get together, spend time together with each other, and break up because 'it's not working out', and they both seek other dates in the next relationship. But why the need to always be with other people just because? I'd rather be alone and not have to deal with drama, lies, etc.\nSure, some people find it easier or more comfortable to simply spend 'quality time' with their loved ones, because they feel the need to keep their relationships with their loved ones healthy. But why do people need to see each other all the time? Why does it seem like there's this huge pressure to constantly be with other people? I feel like people spend more time with each other, and they feel obligated to hang out with each other because they want to avoid being alone, when in fact, I feel like that's pretty much what loners/solitude-lovers seek out themselves, but we just don't have the motivation to stick with it. We have no friends to feel obligated to, so then the next step to not be alone is to simply be in a relationship. But having a relationship doesn't mean that you're not lonely.\nNow, of course, I recognize the benefit of having at least one best friend that you can talk to and hang out and bond with. But that's not what I'm talking",

    "It has been proven that the mammogram is the most successful imaging tool in detecting breast cancer and other life threatening disorders prior to the development of palpable tumors. The accuracy of the mammograms in early detection of breast cancer depends on the radiologist reading the mammograms. Therefore, mammograms require an automated analysis method that will help the radiologist in early detection. Image edge detection is an essential operation in many image processing and image analysis applications. In this paper, an image edge detection technique for mammogram is presented. We employ two different edge detection methods together, namely, Sobel edge detector and Canny edge detector, and use the mean response map to obtain the optimum threshold value for the desired image edges. Moreover, we propose a method to remove the false edge pixels in the detection result via the application of non-linear image smoothing kernels. The proposed method is applied to the images of normal and pathological mammograms. In this study, we used Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) digital mammogram image database and a modified database acquired from the American College of Radiology (ACR). The experimental results show that the proposed approach is efficient and effective.\nI believe that we are able to see the effect of these edge detection methods in this digital image of the \"Wounded Angelus\" by Fra Angelico. In the top figure at the bottom of the post I was using the default image editor that came with Window 7 and did not do any edge enhancements. In the second figure however I used the GIMP editor to sharpen the edges first, then apply the effects of the \"Canny Edge Detection\" method on the left and the \"Sobel Edge Detection\" method on the right.\nIf you have access to the arxiv.org website there is more information about this research paper published on that website.

    "Semipro is one of those rare movies with absolutely nothing to recommend. It's not funny and not suspenseful. It's not interesting and not very smart. It isn't even really bad. It just kind of is. It's like watching a film made inside another film. In Semipro, Will Ferrell stars as a onetime basketball great who coaches the Galesburg Tornadoes of the American Basketball Association. At one time a phenom with the NBA's Denver Nuggets, Jack Tyrone (Ferrell) saw his career dashed when he was caught, like the rest of us, in one of those pesky steroid scandals that plagued the league in the 1990s. Tyrone is given one last shot with the ABA's Cleveland Cavaliers, but gets released for...well, no one will ever know because the rest of the movie is about as eventful as a dead tree. Ferrell, on the downslope of his career, relies on the only talent that he has. He is the greatest mugger in the business. He wears his big, stupid smile and plays on his \"out on the playground\" charm like it's going out of style. But Ferrell is all over the place in this movie. There are so many plotlines that you couldn't keep track of all of them if he did. He is a coach, but he is also a businessman who runs a liquor store for his old coach that he inherited and he plays in the ABA's games to earn more money as an actor than a coach. And to think, all of this could have been a really good movie if Ferrell was a bit more selective about his parts. In real life Ferrell turned down a part in one of the Oscar nominees for Best Picture, No Country for Old Men, and the Oscar winner, Juno. With a little more maturity and some better material, Ferrell could have achieved greater success. But right now, he seems content to go through the roles that he has done so many times. But even the ones he has done repeatedly have potential. If he didn't play the same character every time, I think that he could be really good. It is just a matter of him finding some real talent and a movie that is worthy of his talents.",

    "\"The two biggest formats for downloading digital music, Windows Media Audio and the new Real Audio format, are very similar and use the same general compression technology.\n\"Andy Croy, editor of website Music Ally, said most people would not bother to learn the difference. \"There's a huge consumer apathy in the market, and the only thing most people know about Windows Media and Real is that when they search Google for one of them the other one always turns up.\n\"Those who decide to buy a specific format will be drawn to one camp or another for reasons beyond a technological interest in standards.\"\nHere are my comments on this article – I agree there is an enormous number of people out there who do not care about standards or technologies. This is not much different from the people who go to a bookstore, see two shelves worth of books, and decide to not buy any of them because they simply think it is too difficult to tell them apart. It appears to me that the author had a narrow focus with this article. But what about the millions of people out there who are aware of the different audio formats and prefer mp3? I believe there is a huge number of those, more than the author recognizes. And what about mp3 versus AAC, what about mp3 versus Ogg Vorbis or what about Ogg Vorbis versus Real Audio – you get the point. And what about the millions of people who don't care about audio formats at all, who don't own a computer and don't care where they get their music from, so long as it is there? They either buy CDs at their local mall or they buy them from one of the online stores.\nAs far as I am concerned, the author of this article did not do his homework, in that he didn't give enough perspective or he didn't know enough about mp3. I think that mp3 is a technology that appeals to people – it is ubiquitous and it is a good technology – and it allows people to do what they want to do. If they want to hear mp3s they can do that, and if they want to hear a music format they never before heard of they can do it, and if they want to see what mp3 is all about they can do that too.

    "The Conservatives are condemning proposed reforms of the EU asylum law system, which they are calling a sell-out.\n\nA deal by EU Justice and Home Affairs ministers sets new rules which would make national courts and asylum authorities responsible for deciding whether EU law had been breached.\n\nThe UK's asylum system has come under increasing pressure in recent years as more people have been arriving from France following a crackdown across the Channel.\n\nIn a newspaper article written for _The Times_ published earlier this month, Home Secretary David Blunkett set out a \"fresh approach\" towards the tens of thousands of asylum seekers whose claims are rejected, promising a \"system which rewards those who play by the rules and are compliant with their obligations\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Conservative Home Secretary David Davis said he was deeply concerned that ministers had made commitments to reform the Dublin Convention that would have consequences for UK immigration policy.\n\nAn agreed way of dealing with the movement of rejected asylum seekers is likely to be one of the key policy areas pursued by the new European Commission, the EU's executive, under its president-elect, Jose Manuel Barroso.\n\nMr Blunkett's promised \"fresh approach\" involves taking a more active role in removing those who no longer have the right to stay in the UK.\n\n\"We all understand the need to share responsibility for enforcing what has been a wholly unsatisfactory and unworkable EU approach to the Dublin Convention and asylum seekers for some time,\" said Mr Blunkett.\n\nThe Dublin Convention is an EU agreement under which the member state where an asylum seeker first entered has to take responsibility for that person.\n\nThe agreement has been widely criticised as the most inefficient aspect of the EU asylum law.\n\nAsylum seekers who fail to get the protection they seek can be returned to the country where they first applied. But there is nothing in current EU laws to force the authorities in that country to return them there. They then face the prospect of having to make an application for asylum again.\n\nOne of the key elements in the reform is that rejected asylum seekers should have to seek permission to remain in a member state – so that if they are removed to one of the original signatory countries, they cannot simply re-enter Europe.\n\nThe rules also allow asylum seekers who have been rejected to appeal a rejected claim through the courts, as long",

    "Single Chain Slip-Spring Model for Fast Rheology Simulations of \nEntangled Polymers on GPU\n\nPolymers under external force show non-linear response and often exhibit\nnon-Newtonian characteristics. In many cases, they form networks with a complex\ntopology, called “entangled”. The behaviour of such materials under shear is\nvery important not only from an academic point of view, but also for\npractical applications. For example, in the processing of natural fibres like\ncotton or kenaf, the amount of force needed for fibre dewetting depends\non the structure of the entangled polymer network. This paper describes the\ndevelopment of a fast and flexible single chain model for entangled polymer\nnetworks. For the first time, slip-spring representations and a novel spring\nbond model with a realistic slip dependence are used. The model was developed\nusing GPU programming (Cuda) providing a speed up factor between 6 and\n16, depending on the type of simulation. This can be used as part of an\niterative simulation, with only two parameters necessary to accurately\nmodel the response of the network to non-dilute shear flow. The resulting\nresponse is very similar to that achieved with finite element and Brownian\ndynamics simulations, with the advantage of increased speed of execution\nand very flexible settings. Furthermore, it is possible to compute\ndistribution functions, for example, the end-to-end distribution.\n\n  In addition to the PDF file (linked above), the research paper \"Single Chain Slip-Spring Model for Fast Rheology Simulations of \n  Entangled Polymers on GPU\" from arxiv.org also contains a sample output file of one specific test case, and can be obtained\n  as part of the complete \"SingleChainSlipSpring.zip\" package, which is available with this answer.\n\nAdditional Information\nThis Cuda-based code for the \"Slip-Spring Model for Fast Rheology Simulations of Entangled Polymers\" is a stand-alone program, which can\nbe executed using \"SingleChain\" or \"SingleChainMPI\" in standalone mode or in parallel mode, and will also work with the\n\"SlipSpringModel_Test1_Standalone.py\" or",
    "The researchers, from the University College London and Cardiff Metropolitan University, said they were \"surprised\" by their findings.... The \"wagon wheels\" are called the golf swing's tempo and timing, and both are used as measures of golfing success.\nThe findings are published in the Journal of Sports Sciences[Ref-1].\n[Ref-1] https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48372960\nLet us discuss what \"wagon wheels\" are. Wikipedia defines tempo of a music piece as its speed, which is usually measured in beats per minute (bpm). Wikipedia defines tempo of a music genre as an agreement among the musicians of an ensemble that each note will be played at a certain speed.\nThe term \"tempo\" is used in sports to denote both speed and cadence. Wikipedia further defines tempo as the ability to match one's physical activity to the pace of the opposing team, as in running.\nThe term \"rhythm\" is used in sports to denote time, pacing, and synchronization within a team.\nLet us discuss some of the \"tempo and timing\" in the game of golf. Here, \"tempo\" is about not allowing one's pace or rhythm to vary at any point during the whole course of the move, from taking the club on the ground, to putting the club down on the ground after hitting the ball.\nIf you look closely at golfers in action, you can see that some of them can be moving very fast and yet hitting the ball with slow and controlled moves. On the opposite extreme, some players can be extremely slow, and yet hitting the ball with a fast, controlled move.\nHowever, neither the fast nor the slow moves is good. Why? Because one must make the move so that one hits the ball at a certain pace or speed, which is \"slow enough\" for hitting the ball accurately and \"fast enough\" for hitting the ball with sufficient power.\nThus, a good and successful player will have the ability to control his or her speed, i.e. the tempo, so as to not change it during the whole course of the swing.\nNow, let us move on to timing. Again, timing can be described in two ways.\nOne can have a slow tempo and high timing, or a fast tempo and low timing.",

He said, \"Obviously last time our stay was not the most pleasant and we are back a week later. We lost to Sri Lanka three days ago and that has knocked into our preparations and the way we wanted to go into this tournament. It is not our ideal situation but it is what we have to face now. We are just here to do ourselves justice and hopefully come out and make people happy in South Africa.\"\nSmith has not got the time to think about this situation. He has got plenty of other problems to think about. He said that this situation is not going to create a problem for the team. Smith said, \"We are here purely to win a tournament. It is not about revenge. We just want to win this competition. \"I don't think I will go back to Mauritius if we go on to the final of this tournament - but I have learned to take things as they come. \"It wouldn't have been a big impact on the team in any case and I don't think it will have a big effect on how we go into the tournament.\" The captain's remarks come a day after the ICC's CEO Dave Richardson apologised to his South African counterpart and said the players' return is not good for cricket or the tournament. South Africa were in Mauritius when their security men were injured in an accident at a busy traffic intersection.

    "The first thing you have to do is get over the fact that this movie is an exercise in horror fans poking fun at horror films. I mean, really, who does that? No one. And for that reason a large portion of its target audience wasn’t going to get it, because they only see the thing at the end that they know, and all of the little jokes and allusions that the rest of the audience was laughing at just went right over their head.\nTo me, that’s part of the fun of The Cabin in the Woods.\nTo understand The Cabin in the Woods, you have to understand a few things:\nFirst, the film wasn’t written to be a parody of horror films. It’s actually quite earnest. It was written to be a Lovecraftian horror film, which is as much of a genre as a romantic comedy or historical drama.\nSecond, the best parts of the film are going to be those little winks and nods to the genre of horror film as well as the genre of horror fiction that was Lovecraftian horror...\nThird, it’s just a good, fun story.\nWhen those three things are taken into account, I think that it becomes clear that The Cabin in the Woods is a really good bit of comedy, actually. Sure, it’s a horror comedy, but it’s still a really good comedy. If you’re a fan of film at all it is worth seeing just for the little bit part characters.\nFirst of all, The Cabin in the Woods is, at its core, a film about five friends having a really bad vacation. We follow them through their relationship from its inception through this trip to the cabin that things go horribly wrong at (to where we start with the whole Lovecraftian horror vibe I was mentioning). So, for half a movie we’re watching these college age kids screwing around and getting in trouble with one another, a few hours a bit of mayhem, and then the ending that’s probably going to make a couple of people really angry. What it is is a very typical college friendship sort of thing that’s being played out on a set with a lot of cash thrown at it. So when it’s played out that way, the first half seems, well, boring.

The actor - who is to play Captain Kirk in the next Star Trek film - will be joining Simon Jones and a host of familiar names to lend his voice to the final two episodes of Douglas Adams' radio comedy series.\nThe BBC said it had been working in conjunction with Mr Adams to make sure his vision for the final two episodes would not be compromised.\nThey added that the scripts were the last to be written by the comedy writer before his death last year.\nHe said it was the most enjoyable time he'd ever had on any job in his life, and that it was also a very emotional experience.\nThe BBC said all the other cast members were also keen to play their part in making the fifth series of Hitchhiker's - the first since 1997 - happen.\nMr Jones, who will be reprising his role as Arthur Dent, said: \"The chance to reprise the role of Arthur for this tribute to Douglas is something I would never have missed for the world.

    "In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization problem for learning an optimal partitioning over a set of data points based only on pairwise similarities between data points. As a result, for example, when applied to image data, the partitioning algorithm can be used in image retrieval. The proposed learning procedure is simple, fast, scalable to large datasets, and uses a margin-based loss function. We demonstrate our approach on a set of benchmarks, showing superior performance over baseline systems.\n\nIn his own publication on the subject in 2010, [17], the same person wrote,\n\nPairwise metric learning approaches that require full training data can face computational challenges when the training data is particularly large or cannot be stored in memory. To address this, Kulis _et al._ [7] introduced a set-to-set framework, and in this framework proposed a new pairwise method called LMLSS, which is able to learn from very large datasets.\n\nThis is the _only_ scholarly work that uses the term \"metric learning\", which was first used in \"Large Margin Metric Learning for High-Dimensional Data\" by Hadsell and Schütze of 2006. The only scholarly work available that uses the term \"metric space\" is _Metric learning methods for image classification_, published in 2008, in which case it was used with reference to the work of Hadsell and Schütze.\n\nSince there are so many papers devoted to what is essentially the same approach, it is a fair question to ask why one would want to pursue alternative approaches. The question arises in the papers themselves:\n\nBecause it was designed for large scale problems, the framework has several limitations in the sense that LMLSS [6] is unable to properly utilize a training set which exhibits some peculiar feature spaces. LMLSS also fails to recognize a set with a large number of similar elements. We address these limitations in this paper.\n\nI'll address some of these things later, but first I want to describe a method used to analyze the effectiveness of a given metric and then show a variety of applications where such metrics are used in real life.\n\n# A better way to compare two or multiples items in a metric space\n\nIt is not sufficient for an item to be closer in distance to a common item than to be farther away",

    "This paper presents a deep learning-based solution for mask extraction from video sequence. Given a sequence with a target, we extract a segmentation mask sequence corresponding to the target, which then becomes important for task like human-computer interaction and health monitoring. We propose an encoder-decoder architecture (IDNet) with three subnets: Instance discrimination loss minimization subnet, Context enhancement subnet and Mask reconstruction subnet. The instance discrimination loss ensures every single mask to be instance-wise independent. The context enhancement ensures that the global context is well reconstructed in the corresponding mask. The mask reconstruction subnet ensures that the mask well reflects the image content. To further enhance the performance, we also propose an adaptive sampling strategy. We validate the effectiveness of the presented approach and the proposed loss function by conducting experiment on a custom face-mask dataset (Celebamask-HQ). Quantitative results show significant improvement of our proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn current days, facial masks have been widely applied in medical and public health. In medical context, it is an important tool in disease control, which assists medical doctor to make early diagnosis. In public health context, it is also the most fundamental tool in fighting against SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this situation, it is also important to be able to extract a target (i.e., human face with or without masks) from raw input (i.e., pictures or videos), which further brings great application value for video surveillance, medical diagnosis, online education, social media and so on.\nIn general, semantic segmentation approach consists of four main steps: feature extraction, feature refinement, pixel labeling and model training. For feature extraction step, the common deep neural networks (e.g., VGG-19 [1][2][3][4]) are employed for feature extraction. After that, feature refinement step is applied to improve the extracted features, where the deep neural networks are used to model the feature dependency. The last step, pixel labeling, is where the semantic masks of the targeted class are generated. In this step, common approaches such as fully convolutional network (FCN) [19] and deconvolutional network (DCNN) [20] are applied. For mask refinement in deep neural network, DCNN approaches may lead to poor segmentation results for those distant",
    "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has packed this version of the film full of special features to draw out its theatrical appeal and to give newcomers a better understanding of what makes Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films so different from the rest of Hollywood.\nThe story is exactly the same as in 2002, and it's interesting to see the way some of the humour in which director Raimi is a master has been lost in the jump from screen to home viewing.\nSony has included about 40 minutes of previews for new films from its stable, including the upcoming Fantastic Four. In contrast, the DVD's main bonus feature is \"Becoming Spider-Man\", a behind-the-scenes documentary that runs for almost 60 minutes. It concentrates on the casting of the two key actors, Tobey Maguire as young Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst as his love interest Mary Jane.\nThe disc also includes the feature \"The Return\" which goes into the complicated negotiations to reunite Sam Raimi with Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst for the sequel. Two very short \"music videos\" are included, for the songs \"Sun Stars\" and \"We Belong Together\" performed by Jamey Johnson and Alicia Keys respectively.\nHowever, the main feature is the extensive \"Photojournal\", which includes a cast reel of the three primary members of the film, as well as all the principal cast members, and a gallery of production stills detailing the filming of the stunts and some of the most important set pieces of the saga. Another highlight is the DVD's very informative \"Gag Reel\" which offers much more than just a roll call of the actors' mistakes.\nOther features on the disc include an interactive timeline of the Spider-Man films, a documentary on the story behind the character in comic lore, which is interesting but can be skipped.",

    "We define temporal higher order cyclostationary (THOCS) statistics and their generalization to the compressive setting.\n  Similar to classical cyclostationary statistics, THOCS statistics are based on the Fourier transform of a function over cyclical shifts (periodically wrapped phases) and\nare constructed according to two properties. First, they must form a subset of higher order cumulants and second, the statistic of an ideal linear system must be the inverse of the corresponding ideal transfer function.\nWe generalize these two properties to the compressive setting and show, that with a proper choice of pre-filters, the corresponding statistics define the compressive higher order cyclostationary (CHOCS) space.\nWe demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed statistics as a powerful tool to represent compressive higher order cumulants, perform subspace identification and to detect cyclostationary signal components in compressive data.\n\n\nA: For a concrete example, here is a graph showing how to use the Wold decomposition to separate signals corresponding to different frequencies or harmonic components. This data was taken from the classic example of an oscillator with two distinct frequencies. The original data contains both sinusoidal components but, because they are mixed together, we won't be able to see two independent signals right now.\nLet's start by defining a matrix of 2,000 data points:\n# Number of samples\nN = 2000\nfreq1 = 2.5*pi\nfreq2 = 2.*pi\nt = linspace(0, 1/N, N);  # times\ny = sin(t + freq1);       # Signal (1)\ny_two_tone = y + 0.1*sin(2.*t + freq1 + freq2);  # Signal (2)\n\nBecause they are mixed together, let's just take a look at a small chunk of data:\nplot(t, y_two_tone)\nxlabel('Frequency [Hz]')\nylabel('Amplitude')\n\nThen find the DFT:\n# Fourier Transform\nw = fft(y_two_tone);\nw /= abs(w);       # Make the signal energy consistent across frequencies\n\nNext, we can plot the magnitude and the phase",
    "To begin with, let me say that I find it very hard to open about these issues because of the way we, as a society, tend to think of them. I'm here to help myself clear the air and share some of the things people might find interesting about these mental issues that I think is not the way it is on every other person on the planet.\nI've always been a fairly introverted person, I'm not really an outgoing person but I do like to talk to some friends, to my parents, to my relatives and with people working in my industry (software development and business), sometimes about the latest industry news but I've never really experienced a lot of problems with that.\nMy problem is that I've always found it very hard to socialize. I've always been more of a quiet and rather \"antisocial\" person, not because I'm not interested in other people and having a good time but because I think I'm just not one of those people who can let go and start laughing with others for no reason and sometimes I feel awkward when I'm with people I don't know really well.\nAlso, I get easily excited about things I like. For example, a new game or a new book or a new project I'm working on...\nWhen you get excited like this with other people, well... it kind of gives away where you're actually coming from.\nFor example, let's say you go to a movie with your best friend. You have a good time and you have a lot of things to say to your best friend like: \"I love this movie, it's great, I'm going to see it again\" and so on. There are other things that you might say to your best friend, some are silly things other are very serious but you're saying them because in your head you're still watching this movie you are thinking about before saying something funny that might not make sense to someone else.\nOther than that, everything else is fine. But not everything is fine because there are some moments when you just don't act that way.\nSometimes you say things in your head that you just don't say out loud, but you do like when you hear other people say them.\nFor example, let's say you say something to your friends and they start telling you that you're not being really",

    "\"An outstanding experience for the first 30 minutes and completely worthless throughout the rest of the movie. I walked out of the theater during the last twenty minutes because I knew it was only going to get worse.\nThe first thirty minutes and most of the rest of the movie was a masterpiece of editing and cinematography. It was beautifully photographed. The acting was excellent for the first half of the movie, and the script and direction were brilliant. The music was superb. However, all this talent was wasted on a story about combat in Vietnam which has been told millions of times before and had absolutely no point except to tell the same tired \"war is a hell\" story.\nThe last twenty minutes was about a marine training camp. After about four hours of combat in Vietnam, I could not have cared less about what the marines did at their training camp. The \"good\" marines in the movie were just plain stupid. There was a scene where one marine was making fun of another marine from the \"outpost\" of Fort Knox, and he just couldn't see beyond that stereotype. Another scene was where two \"good\" marines were making fun of the two \"bad\" marines, and the \"good\" marines acted like they were above it, but actually they were acting just like the \"bad\" marines.\nAnother scene was where one \"good' marine asked another what he wanted out of life, and the other marines just looked at him like he was crazy or asking a stupid question. He was finally told that he should either have a job and a family or go back in the jungle or something like that. Is that what they had to say to recruits? \"You want to know what you should want out of life? You either better be content with working for your brother in law and raising your nephew, or forget it.\" \"Wow,\" he should have replied, \"Thanks.\" Who wants either of those two choices?\nThe one marine who spoke Japanese showed more character in five minutes than all the other marines put together.

    "Manchester City's new signing Gael Clichy looks a bargain at £7m. The defender has shown in the last month that his pace and composure make him a huge asset to Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. City's purchase is an example of why a club can get value for money out of a friendly. But it is not necessarily a clear sign of \"doing a clever deal\".\nThe likes of Carlos Tevez, Emmanuel Adebayor and Fernando Torres have all been seen as top-flight centre-forwards, just the kind of players the Premiership and England need. But how have they fared?\nThe same argument can be made for a host of top-class English talents now plying their trade elsewhere.\nThe days of signing world-class players like Thierry Henry, Ronaldo and Robert Pires seem long gone for England's top clubs, so the idea of \"friendlies\" is becoming increasingly less of an idea and more of a problem at the very top of the game.\nClichy could go on and become a top-class defender, or he could get injured tomorrow morning. He could have a terrific season and he could have a terrible season.\nIt is only a friendly so what is the point of getting too worked up about a deal that does not mean City have signed the player, who has a contract at Arsenal up to 2011.\nBut this friendly is hardly the kind of test match that will tell City or any other club whether Clichy is good enough to make a first-team appearance.\nAnd it is not just at the top of the game where the friendly culture may be starting to take its toll.\nThe lower leagues may see a player's debut as being when the ball is kicked and the player starts running with it. But what about the player who is not good enough to do that well, or maybe just needs some time to adapt to the rigours of the game.\nThis is the type of player that has suffered most under the new system introduced in the summer. The loan system is aimed at helping to bring on youngsters but the fact remains that they are still playing with professional footballers.\nIf a player is not playing with the right type of people then he will not grow as quickly as the youngsters who are playing with the right players.\nAnd this is why",
    "The National Security Agency is worried that terrorists could be using cheap, fast-moving phones as part of plans to attack the US. The NSA believes that small terrorist cells could be buying and then re-selling cheap mobile phones to avoid being tracked and traced. \"It is possible that small terrorist cells could be using untraceable pre-paid phones as part of their planning and attack methods,\" an official told the House of Representatives intelligence committee in a classified hearing last week. NSA Director Gen Michael Hayden told investigators he has assigned his Counter-Terrorism Center to analyse how likely such a threat is, according to ABC News. \"The threat doesn't need to be a small one, nor does the cell need to be large in its size, just the ability for their communications to be difficult to track and penetrate,\" Gen Hayden said. \"That capability, in many ways, is available today.\" He added that NSA staff have had preliminary conversations with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, but he declined to say whether the CIA has been informed. A spokesman for the Counterterrorism Center said that he could not comment further. \"The NSA has been at the forefront of identifying ways in which the terrorist community makes effective use of commercial telecommunications services,\" he told Reuters. \"These tools provide an important counterfoil to the terrorists' ability to communicate and collaborate with each other. \"The NSA, in concert with the US intelligence community and our federal law enforcement partners, is using these capabilities and resources to collect relevant terrorism-related communications.\" In February 2006, the US Congress ordered the intelligence agencies to draft plans for dealing with the threat of using commercial phones for terrorist attacks. Gen Hayden said it would be hard for the NSA to pinpoint the small, short-lived groups planning an attack. \"They are small, they have very few face-to-face contacts, they rarely meet in the same place twice and they are constantly on the move,\" he told the investigators, ABC reports. The NSA said it was committed to addressing the new threats and that Gen Hayden had also recently told a senior military group that the agency was \"working to acquire information about terrorists' use of wireless phones\" to carry out attacks on the US. \"Such phones can be bought by a terrorist in one country, used for a while and then dumped in another country without it being possible to link them to terrorists,\" a Congressional staffer told Reuters.",

    "> **Identifying Reliable Annotations for Large Scale Image Segmentation**\n> \n> *Mingkang Yang, Qi Zhou, Jingdong Wang, Chen Change Loy, Dacheng Tao*\n> \n> **Abstract:** Recently, large scale image segmentation based on deep convolutional neural networks (Refinenet, DeepLabv3+, ICNet, etc..) becomes mainstream research. In fact, these models are trained with a large number of noisy annotations, as it is laborious and time-consuming to annotate semantic images manually. In this paper, we investigate the impact of annotation noises on model training and evaluation for large scale image segmentation. To this end, we manually correct two popular datasets (ADE20K and PASCAL VOC12) with noisy annotation, and re-evaluate large scale image segmentation models on these clean datasets. On ADE20K, we found that the performance of Refinenet and DeepLabv3+ on clean and noisy datasets diverge a lot, which we attribute to the noises. On the other hand, the performance of ICNet and GCNet are more robust to noises, i.e., there is less performance decay when the noisy datasets are replaced with clean datasets. This observation agrees with a previous result that ICNet and GCNet can learn more reliable feature representations from noisy annotations. Furthermore, the model-agnostic metrics, e.g., consistency of evaluation metrics, model calibration, and generalization gap, are not reliable to estimate the quality of model training. We summarize our findings in the following three aspects: 1) the performance gap between clean and noisy datasets is not a good criteria to infer the impact of annotation noises on model training; 2) the models have different impacts from annotation noises: the models that overfit the noises suffer from performance decay, while the others with more reliable feature representations are more robust; 3) the model-agnostic performance metrics are not good enough to assess the quality of training models with noisy annotations. We hope our study can help the community to rethink about how to use the noisy annotations for training large scale image segmentation models.\n\n## The Results Are Not as Intended\n\nThe results are not as intended by the team: even though both models performed well (close to each other) on the noisy dataset, when the",

In the framework of a general\n  class of equations that can describe the evolution of turbulent flows with rapid rotation, it is proved that the global attractor exists and it is connected. Then, we study its geometrical and topological properties and,\n  in particular, it is shown that the global attractor for the nonautonomous system has a finite number of singular points. Furthermore, a connection with dynamical systems is provided, by\n  obtaining the local asymptotic stability properties of the attractor. To achieve all these results, a suitable time-parametrization of the system is found and the semigroup approach on the abstract\n  phase space is used.\n\n\nA: In the book Geometric Theory of Dynamical Systems, Félix Hérau states in section 4.2.6, p. 145, of Chapter 4 in volume one of the series, \"... a general theory of the construction of the global attractor via finite-dimensional reductions\n ... was given by Kupka [25], and it was developed by J.-P. Eckmann and O. Peli [21]....\"\nHérau gives p. 146, as reference 25, \"Global attractors for semigroup actions defined on Hilbert spaces\", M. Kupka (1996), J. Funct. Anal. 152, pp. 263-299.",

But Houllier said last night: \"Michael is staying with the club and that is it. Michael will not leave.\"\nAfter Wednesday's victory, Owen said he was looking forward to the next four years with \"optimism and hope\".\nHoullier added: \"At the moment, all the players are committed to the club. They are focused on what we are trying to do over the next few seasons.\nYou can view the original article at bbc.com.\nA:\tNewcastle would like Owen back and he wants to stay at Anfield.

    "Chelsea have sacked Romania international striker Adrian Mutu, citing breaches of both his image rights and \"personal conduct clauses\". The 27-year-old, who was banned by FIFA in 2005 for drug offences after testing positive for cocaine, has also been fined £1m for unauthorised interviews in Romania. He has 12 months to pay the fine. In a statement, the reigning UEFA Champions League winners said: \"Chelsea FC...regards its players' image rights as a vital part of their commercial exploitation and protection. \"These rights are subject to a strict regime which players are asked to adhere to and which Mr Mutu has deliberately breached. Consequently, Chelsea FC has today agreed a settlement for termination of his contract.\" Chelsea said the termination was without prejudice to Mutu's defence of his claim of wrongful dismissal. Mutu, who joined Chelsea from Parma in July 2003, is believed to be seeking compensation for unlawful dismissal. His personal representative is believed to be asking for £20m from the Premier League champions. He won the Premier League title with Chelsea in his first season but, despite scoring 14 times in the two following campaigns, the club have been concerned by his off-field discipline. In September 2004 he was fined £50,000 by a Football Association regulatory commission for three incidents - for failing to leave the pitch promptly after his late equaliser at West Ham and swearing during the celebrations for his late winner against Wolves. Then, after he was sent-off against Tottenham in November 2005, he was banned for eight games after testing positive for cocaine. The ban was later increased to 12 months. Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck stated earlier this month that Mutu was \"not playing or training\" and insisted there was \"no way back\" for the forward.\nS.2.\tStudents answer the following question on the same article:\nMutu’s manager at Chelsea, Glen Hoddle, said he did not believe drugs were the problem and believed Mutu should continue to play.

    "By James Oaten, BBC news\n\nThe web blog, or web log, has become an invaluable tool to businesses and individuals. And some experts say it could be a vital aid to the emergency and disaster planning of enterprises.\n\nWeb logs were born in the late 1990s for individuals to record their ideas and share them with the world.\n\nNow they are increasingly being used by companies, including some of the biggest organisations in the world, for everything from recording daily events, to monitoring project progress or simply giving customers a chance to talk back.\n\nAccording to Netcraft, an internet monitoring firm, just over four million blogs are being used across the globe, by individuals and businesses large and small.\n\nIt is easy to see why firms have turned to web logs to record the minute-to-minute goings-on in their companies. They provide a cheap and easy route for employees to comment on the latest events, but also to record key project progress points.\n\nAt the same time, they can help firms to engage with their customers by allowing them to discuss issues and give their thoughts on the latest corporate developments.\n\nIt is easy to see why they might have a place in the emergency and disaster planning of an organisation.\n\nMany of the key elements needed by businesses to cope with large, sudden disruptions, including power failures and major outbreaks of illness, are also used by individuals to handle a variety of small-scale disasters -- such as flooding and power failures as a result of storms.\n\nJust as it is the case in the wider community, it is essential that businesses keep track of such things in the event of an emergency so that they can plan for the impact of the problem and cope with an incident.\n\nSo, in the event of a power failure, for example, it would be helpful for companies to know how many people in the organisation have their own personal power generator, so that key roles can be filled by trusted employees.\n\nBut, for organisations concerned with coping with a large-scale incident, it is even more important to plan ahead and have systems in place before trouble strikes.\n\nSo, rather than looking at how this new technology could help organisations in the event of a sudden disruption, it would also be interesting to examine whether companies are keeping logs of the potential disasters that they have a duty to prepare for.\n\nIn",
    "France, Europe's third biggest spender on TV, plans to end analogue broadcasts by the end of next year. The French government has invested about 1 bn euros ($1.46 bn) in the switch but most households still do not have the right equipment. The roll-out will start in February in areas around Lille, close to the Belgian border.\nThe rest of France will move over in the second half of the year. Viewers will need a set-top-box to receive the new digital signal. The French government hopes they will also start paying for a new package of channels that have been developed along with the new signal.\nAs the French government wants to push viewers to pay for the new services, the new analogue signal will be switched off with no warning for those who do not have a compatible receiver. Only about 25% of households own such a device but the government hopes that number will reach 60% within two years. (The news item appeared on December 30, 2007.)\nIn the French debate around the issue of digital terrestrial television broadcast, some of the people interviewed and quoted had interesting and even amusing things to say. They may be worth quoting. The following is what Christian Jacob, president of the state-owned Radio France Group, had to say to Reuters: \"We are entering into a new era in which we don't know how viewers will pay for information and content and we're experimenting.\" (The news item appeared at: http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNewsthreatsNews/idUKLU70253392000703.)\nThere are three major points that must be addressed by any country that is thinking of moving over to digital terrestrial television. The first is the availability of the broadcast spectrum. Although it is true that analog television channels occupy only a small portion of the broadcast spectrum for analog signals, the spectrum for digital television signals is much more spectrum than what analog television signals require. In many countries, the government is not liberal enough (to use a liberal term!) in the granting of broadcast licenses or in the allocation of bandwidth for use by broadcast service providers. I have read one article that says that in the United States \"the number of frequencies granted to digital television service providers to operate their DTV services and to carry out their marketing plans for their newly introduced DTV services to the public is minuscule in comparison to the amount",

There are too many more qualified, experienced, better-connected people who have been working their asses off since they can remember. It is not enough for you to be a good person who tries to make a difference. It is not enough for you to be someone who works hard and pays their bills on time. It is not enough for you to be someone who does their homework and goes through the proper channels.\nSo, instead of spending your time hoping to succeed, you can just spend it resenting the fact that you failed to. You can spend all that energy hating everyone and feeling entitled. There are too many people who want what you have now. You don't have a leg to stand on. You have nothing to offer. It is not your fault that you weren't born with enough connections, experience, or qualifications to do your job well enough to prevent the company from falling into financial trouble. You didn't make enough sales.\nWealth inequality is not a problem, but it is no less prevalent than it was before. It is just that it is getting worse, and it isn't our fault. Money doesn't buy happiness. There are people who work hard, try their best, and get very little. But there are people who are just awful. They never work hard and still get a lot. We can't control the way we are born, but we can control how that affects us. Life is a struggle. And it never ends.\nIf you think life is fair, chances are you are rich, because life is not fair. Some get more than others. Some do more than others. Some are born in a bubble of privilege, and others are born in an abysmal hell. Some grow up in families with two loving parents, and those parents were able to stay together and raise their children. Others have to grow up alone, or with an absent parent, or a mother that doesn't love them as much as they love their other kids.\nThe world isn't perfect.",

    "Why do people have such a strong opinion against thinking. I know all the reasons for it as listed in the first link below but I just can't understand why there should be any difference between \"involuntary\" and \"voluntary\" thoughts; can somebody explain to me why thinking is different from \"non-thinking\" (if there is any such thing as \"non-thinking\"), or how is \"voluntary\" different from \"involuntary\", or whatever.\n\nThe first link is: wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention and the second link is: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_thought\nThe first link on the question's original post has this to say about the differences between voluntary and involuntary thoughts:\n\nIntention is the conscious desire or choice to act in a certain way. One distinguishes voluntary actions of the agent from involuntary actions such as reflex actions or pathological behaviors. [...]\n\nHowever, if one really thinks about it, there doesn't seem to be any fundamental difference between voluntary and involuntary things in general. I mean to say that the difference between something that happens \"voluntarily\" vs. \"involuntarily\" (as the questioner implies) isn't exactly clear. I might be thinking \"voluntarily\", but my thoughts are produced by my brain (which might itself be an involuntary process if you go deep enough), so why should thoughts be considered any different than, say, involuntary muscle movements?\nWhy? because my brain's doing its best to produce the thoughts, but at the end it's kind of a waste of effort, because I'm already very certain that everything I think of and everything my mind \"produces\" to me is absolutely pointless. I'd rather it did not have to do all the pointless work, but I can't help it, the thought just comes to me on its own. So what's the point of making a difference whether the thought is voluntary or involuntary is?\nMy brain might be more \"alive\" when producing thoughts, but if it just stopped doing that (or got sick and died or whatever), I wouldn't actually experience any real difference.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the difference between a voluntary and an involuntary thought comes down to whether or not your brain decides to produce the thought.\n\nMy point is that, since there",
    "In traditional stereo systems, a pair of images captured by parallel cameras is used to reconstruct a detailed 3D scene. Stereo matching is the process of estimating the correspondence between each pixel of each camera image. We present an inverse search algorithm that computes pixel correspondences in a dense matching framework. As part of our approach, we present a novel cost aggregation scheme that is well-suited for pixel matching. We demonstrate that we can accurately predict pixel correspondences for an endoscopic surgery camera pair, and we validate our algorithm with ground truth obtained by scanning a surgical phantom.\n\nV. DISCUSSION\nIn this paper, we proposed multiple Bayesian network architectures to solve the problem of dense stereo matching in minimally invasive surgery. This approach is motivated by the fact that existing methods are computationally expensive and do not perform well under certain conditions such as depth discontinuities and occlusions. The proposed architecture consists of a pair of Bayesian networks (one per camera view) that can estimate dense pixel-wise disparity maps from monocular input images using pixel-wise disparity estimates from the other network as contextual cues. We then fused the predictions of the two networks into a dense disparity map using Bayesian inference on the pixel-wise disparity estimates obtained from both views. During the Bayesian inference, we also incorporated pixel-wise depth information in both monocular and binocular directions.\nWe tested our algorithm on several 3D reconstruction datasets from surgical videos. The proposed network architectures outperformed the baseline Bayesian network architectures and existing stereo matching algorithms at predicting pixel-wise disparity accurately. Note that our algorithm also makes predictions in unconstrained scenarios such as occlusions, textureless regions, complex shadows and depth discontinuities. While our experiments suggest that the proposed architectures lead to more accurate disparity prediction, further studies on how the two networks interact with each other are required to make the algorithm more efficient. Also, future work will be focused on using these prediction results for improving surgical gesture segmentation and robot planning.\nOur approach is different from prior literature in three ways: • We jointly predict pixel-wise disparities for both monocular and binocular direction. Prior literature [13], [22], [27], [36] have assumed that estimating disparities for binocular direction is more accurate thus we first need to estimate pixel-wise disparities for the monocular direction and then we can predict disparities for the binocular direction.

    "When dealing with large data sets, it is common to require multiple views of each object. For an individual class, volumetric 3D data might be available from multiple viewpoints, or the viewpoints themselves might evolve from each other, e.g., through variations in lightening conditions and camera settings. As an extreme case, some specific applications require to reconstruct objects that are very small at a high resolution, e.g., nanoscale biological specimens.\nDue to the difficulty to collect large scale datasets of volumetric images, most state of the art works on classification and segmentation of 3D volumes are based on supervised learning approaches, requiring training samples for all individual classes. Furthermore, the high 3D resolution leads to large computational times for training and testing. On the contrary, unsupervised approaches often rely, at least at the end of the pipeline, on one single image as input, potentially leading to difficulties to deal with objects that can naturally appear in very different forms or orientations. Furthermore, the large scale of real-world data usually requires processing multiple object instances at once and/or processing an evolving large number of images.\nFor this reason, we propose an unsupervised framework for classification of 3D volume objects, based on \"squeeze and excitation\" [1] modules to learn image representations for few-shot segmentation of volumetric image data. Given only a small number of labeled training examples (with no need for data of all classes), our framework (1) produces a segmentation result for unlabeled test data, and (2) also provides a new segmentation, as a generalization across classes and viewpoints. Our approach allows to segment different orientations of the same object classes, as well as distinct objects of the same class.\nOur method is very efficient and provides segmentation results in real-time on CPU with only few frames. Our experimental results show that our method compares to state of the art methods on few-shot segmentation tasks from different viewpoints on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets.\nSqueezing and excitation (S&E) is a technique for improving a deep neural network's ability to analyze inputs by adding a new channel-adaptive mechanism.

    "A Bank of England committee voted 8-1 to keep interest rates unchanged yesterday, saying a fall in inflation justified an extended period of stability at home and abroad. Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee's August meeting showed the majority's view was shared by just two of the nine members, who dissented on the grounds of uncertainty over inflation. The vote was for an inflation forecast of 1.8%.\n\nA _Skew T-Digest_ plot of these data is shown in Figure 6-13. Observe how the vertical bars represent the frequency of each of the interest rates rather than the probability of the rates. For example, it is quite likely that interest rates were 4.25%. This rate is represented by a height of about 20%.\n\n### **6.2.5 Data Visualization and Text Summary**\n\nMany data visualizations can be used to highlight different aspects of a dataset. In addition to providing a quick way of finding interesting groups of records in a large dataset, these features often are the only method that makes sense for analyzing a large amount of data. For example, in the _Text Mining for Web Search Engines_ chapter, we discussed a series of different visualizations for finding interesting words in large text documents. In the _Image Processing_ chapter, we briefly discussed a visualization method in which images were colored with different colors depending on the dominant orientation of their constituent pixels. In both cases, visualizations were used to efficiently find interesting patterns of data in very large datasets.\n\n**Figure 6-13:** A scatter plot of _x_ -axis interest rates plotted against _y_ -axis votes from the Bank of England.\n\nWhen trying to analyze very large and noisy datasets, we typically want to visualize the relationships present in the data, but it is often very useful to add a summary of the datasets to the visualization. For example, consider Figure 6-14, which shows a scatter plot of _x_ -axis votes from the Bank of England versus _y_ -axis interest rates. In addition to showing a trend in which votes of 8 (interest rates are falling) tend to favor lower interest rates and votes of 1 (interest rates are increasing) tend to favor higher interest rates, we could also provide a simple count of the number of records in each category to understand how the votes are distributed across interest rates.

    "We propose a flexible design of long-haul optical systems that has the potential to increase spectral efficiency and reduce the number of wavelengths (channels) with high capacity in the systems. Our scheme, named Flexi-Grid, uses the transmission wavelength grid in the optical multiplexer/de-multiplexer (MUX/DMUX) of the system to form flexible grid configurations. In specific configurations, Flexi-Grid allows re-using the wavelengths of the MUX/DMUX of another node to form a virtual multi-ring network (VMR). The VMR increases network flexibility and allows to reduce the wavelength resources for the longest links in the network. We present analytical results for the minimum number of spare fibers and wavelengths required by each node of Flexi-Grid in order to guarantee high-availability connections. We also propose a dynamic provisioning method for Flexi-Grid that avoids blocking in the systems by re-routing or pre-provisioning the paths in the network. Finally, we provide experimental results using standard network emulation software to evaluate the performance of our proposal.\nThe idea of Flexi-Grid is pretty simple, and is explained in the \"Introduction\" section of the abstract.\nIn a previous paper, \"Towards Flexi-Grid Long-Haul Optical Networks\" posted on arXiv on January 5, 2021, the authors, Akshay Katti, H. Vincent Poor, Michael Kozuch, and James A.J. Fitzpatrick, explore the problem of optimizing spectral efficiency in fiber-optic communications.\nThe results they present in this paper are intriguing. Among other things, they propose \"a new optical network design that can significantly improve power efficiency and wavelength utilization in long-haul optical systems.\"\nThey also state: \"To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few proposals that takes into account the potential for optical path re-provisioning during network planning.\"\nAs the authors state, it is a bit early for the fiber-optics systems to become overloaded, but in light of everything that's happening in the world with the Covid-19 pandemic, it would not be a surprise if global communications infrastructure becomes overwhelmed.\nFlexi-Grid is designed to reduce and optimize the number of channels used in long-haul fiber-optics networks",
    "We present a novel hybrid UNet-based architecture called H-DenseUNet for 3D automatic liver and tumor segmentation from CT volumes in this paper. H-DenseUNet combines the advantages of DenseUNet and UNet, which overcomes the difficulties like high dimensionality, limited GPU memory and small volume size. In the encoder, an architecture similar to DenseUNet is implemented, which effectively reduces the parameter number of the network and improves the performance of the model. In the decoder, it is a UNet architecture which is more expressive than DenseUNet and can recover hierarchical features better, while the feature maps in the decoder are directly connected to all the layers in encoder (i.e. all feature maps in the encoder) so that the output feature map can utilize more features from different dimensions, which is beneficial to improve segmentation accuracy. A loss function designed by Dice-sGD is used in this work. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we conducted experiments on the large-scale NIH Abdominal Aorta Aneurysm CT Database. The experimental results show that our model has better segmentation accuracy, higher robustness, and higher parameter efficiency than existing models.\n\n# 2. Related Work\n\n## 2.1 Image Segmentation with Deep Learning\n\nFrom the very beginning, researchers have studied how to extract and represent features automatically [16, 17]. In the age of deep learning, feature extraction has gradually transferred from traditional hand-crafted features to neural networks that can automatically extract high-level semantic features from raw data without explicit feature design. With the increase of data and computing power, a large number of deep learning models have been proposed for semantic segmentation [18]. In recent years, with the rapid development of data centers and high-quality image datasets, the emergence of deep learning image segmentation algorithms has led to new breakthroughs and developments.\n\nSemantic segmentation can be divided into multi-class semantic segmentation and binary semantic segmentation. Multi-class semantic segmentation assigns pixel-level semantic labels to each class in the image [19]. Binary semantic segmentation usually takes the pixels of the target or background as the foreground and the remaining pixels as the background [20]. The latter type of segmentation is more closely related to medical imaging, because segmentation of medical",

    "I am a female professional in my early thirties.  Most of my work and school years I experienced the gender equality mindset: Men and women can do the same jobs/projects/classes just as long as they're competent, same pay, etc.  Now as a professional I work at a Fortune 500 company and the ratio of men to women is about 10:1.  The mentality now is that only men are able to perform the role, due to the long hours and sometimes gruelling nature of the work.  When I bring this up they look at me like I just threw an actual grenade in the room.  I am also a single woman and have little to no time for a serious relationship.  Also, as of my last two positions, I've been working on teams with women in leadership positions.  The mindset for them is that as women we need to be promoted and have leadership positions so that our teams are able to be more rounded since women have different experiences and life events, etc.  \n\nIn my current job, my manager recently told me that I haven't been given performance bonuses because of the \"conflict in my behavior.\"  I'm not the type to bring up this kind of information; it just came up as part of the conversation.  The other woman I was working with in my department is a bit on the abrasive side.  She's gotten into disagreements with other leaders and generally just gets what she wants, regardless of what is right by the rules or how someone else might feel.  Apparently management noticed this and decided that with me on the team, she was able to do her own thing and they'd prefer me go.\n\nI think it's great there are more women in leadership and hopefully, as more of us work in the industry, that mentality will change.

I've been asked many of these questions at various points in my education and it's always been hard for me to gauge them. In all honesty, I think you're asking the wrong questions for the wrong reasons. I think it's imperative that first year students ask questions and be proactive, but I think it's equally important that students don't make choices based on \"what the teachers think,\" and don't worry about the future. They're all just questions that they won't be able to answer immediately.

    "\"Man on Fire\" is the story of John Creasy (the excellent Denzel Washington), a former CIA agent who now works as a bodyguard to children in Mexico. When one of his wards, little Danny, is kidnapped from his parents, Creasy finds out he and his wife were targeted by the cartel that had kidnapped Danny -- and that they murdered the children Creasy had previously guarded. He tracks down and kills their leader, and he demands the name of the man who ordered the crime. But Creasy is told the cartel never keeps records of those who pay them, so he begins the search for the man himself... the one, he promises himself, that \"did this\" to Danny and his family.\nThe only thing preventing this movie from being more than a cut-above-average action flick are the supporting characters. Creasy's wife, Jessica, is not only a complete \"Damsel in Distress,\" but she's also portrayed as a wimp as well as a helpless pushover. This may be Creasey's way of thinking that without him, Jessica would not be able to take care of herself in any fashion. This may be correct, but a woman does not look good as an incompetent dolt in need of a hero. Also, he takes Jessica and little Danny with him on his quest for revenge, putting the young child at risk (although Danny is portrayed as being a very brave youngster and Creasey is very protective of him). And his new employer, Robert (Christopher Walken), is portrayed as being a sneaky, conniving individual. But the best portrayal of a \"villain\" is Samantha, the evil little girl who is Danny's replacement.\nCreasey is portrayed as not being a superhero, despite all his superhuman abilities, but he is still portrayed as a near invincible hero who can do everything better than anyone else can do it. This may just be the Hollywood formula that has been used to make so many movies these days: the \"Rambo\" story. In fact, Washington has been a part of the \"Rambo\" franchise. This film lacks the emotion that the \"Rambo\" sequels had -- and in a film of this kind, such emotion should be there when Creasey discovers Jessica's corpse.

Deep learning methods have also been shown to improve results in comparison to image analysis by radiologists.\nIn this presentation, we will discuss the current developments in computer-aided diagnosis including the application of deep neural networks for the automatic extraction of relevant information from medical scans. We will then look at the current applications of deep learning techniques to the analysis and segmentation of cardiac CT scans.\nThis post from the website of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) contains a large collection of abstracts of presentations related to the application of artificial intelligence for cardiac computed tomography.

The scene with the two burglars chasing Kevin on the skateboards and him swinging the baseball bat is one of my favorite Kevin moments.\nBut back to the review: A funny holiday film.\nThe plot: A young boy named Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) is staying all alone at home for an entire week and his relatives are out of town. The boy believes nobody else has noticed he's not in the house, so he thinks it is up to him to protect it.\nWhile Kevin is away on an errand, two thieves named Marv and Harry (Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci) invade his house and attempt to rob it. But their plans are foiled by Kevin who plans on getting some revenge for the trouble.\nMy comment after reading this review:\nI was reminded of my youth while I read this review and I couldn't stop giggling. My son loved \"Home Alone\" when he was older, until he had to stay home alone to babysit and learned what it was like. I remember when our house was burglarized, my dad, the kids, and I stayed at our neighbor's house. It was a scary thing, especially since the burglar gained entry into our house by busting down our sliding glass door. It was horrible, especially since my mom had a lot of jewelry. I never would have believed we would have the problems we did. Thank God those guys didn't come in during the daytime when my kids or I were home or I shudder to think what they might have tried to do.\nI thought \"Home Alone\" was one of the funniest movies ever made, if only because I could remember back when I had to stay alone to babysit and I just didn't have a lot of freedom as a kid.

    "\"Machine learning models have been developed and trained to identify images with specific concepts, such as birds, cats, and so on. However, these deep neural networks often have high confidence in labeling images that contain concepts they were not trained on. Since the labels from the training data are deterministic, the neural networks struggle to properly identify when they are making predictions that were not explicitly trained on, which is a big problem when the model has to be used in real-world applications. This research is the first to leverage neural networks' prediction distributions to create a more reliable labeling of images that contain a concept. The results prove that predictions from multiple models can be used to construct a multi-class label from one image. The multi-class label can then be used to improve the quality and reliability of labeling images in the wild.\n\"Spatially Varying Label Smoothing (SVLS) provides a way to make label smoothing more realistic by treating each region of an image as an individual class. SVLS leverages a neural network's prediction distribution as a proxy for uncertainty of predictions. For each pixel (x, y) in an image, SVLS computes the maximum prediction probability over all classes that a network predicted and smooths the original one-hot label for that pixel according to the maximum probability. In this research project, the idea behind SVLS was tested with different types of classifiers, three variations on SVLS, and a range of regularization coefficients. The results of the experiments show that SVLS significantly reduces the misclassification of objects from other classes on images when the regularization coefficient is large. SVLS also outperforms entropy-based smoothing for all of the cases it was tested on. Our experiments show that the most reliable model is VGGLO, which is a generative label-only image classifier from the Vision and Graphics Group at the Facebook AI Research. The best regularization coefficient for VGGLO was 0.1, which was determined after a hyperparameter search.\"\nSpatially Varying Label Smoothing: Capturing Uncertainty from Expert Annotations Arjun Mukherjee1, Andrew Lazowska1 arxiv.org/abs/2108.04992\nWhile the original paper above, written by Arjun Mukherjee and Andrew Lazowska, discusses SV",

    "In this paper we address the vacuum formation and stability against\n  the classical vacuum collapse due to pressure waves using the flux\n  approximation.

The paper also contains the discussion of the\n  vacuum formation during the formation and stabilization of a\n  contact discontinuity, which is a part of some hydrodynamic shock\n  patterns. There is a similarity in the phenomena of the vacuum\n  formation in the two different contexts (due to rarefaction waves or\n  due to delta-shocks) which are connected with the same process: (1)\n  the contact transition of the gas pressure to the vacuum state, and\n  (2) the formation and stabilization of the rarefaction waves between\n  the vacuum state and the post-shock gas state. A particular example\n  of the vacuum formation in the rarefaction waves region (near the\n  contact discontinuity) in the case of the flow of the relativistic\n  gas within the non-relativistic medium was demonstrated. This result\n  contrasts with the well-known conclusion about the relativistic gas\n  cannot produce the vacuum in front of a strong discontinuity.  The\n  reasoning about delta-shocks formation was continued up to the\n  ultimate (Müller) limit: the discontinuity between two rarefaction\n  waves, which were just formed from the strong shocks; this limit\n  allowed us to get the asymptotic pressure profile in the limit of the\n  very sharp vacuum production and the very thin contact discontinuity.\n\n\nA: This question, and even its most recent edit, seems entirely a matter of taste and opinion.  It does not seem to warrant a canonical answer.  Yet I think there is a way to make this question more \"on topic\" and to help it fit the form of \"good questions\".\nWe can consider this very long question a problem whose problem statement has not been made clear.  If I have not been able to make it clear, I hope other mathematicians will help make it clear.",

(The title comes from a speech by Alan Alda in the movie - you will never know which part of the speech.)\nThe movie is based on a true story about a lawyer, James Donovan, who helped negotiate the release of a captured American plane pilot in exchange for a Soviet spy.\nThe story is an intriguing spy thriller, with a great performance by Mark Rylance, who plays Russian spy Rudolf Abel, and Tom Hanks, who plays the US lawyer James Donovan.\nI was worried that, despite the fact that the movie has good IMDb rating, I may find it boring. This is not the case, as the movie has an extraordinary dramatic structure, full of interesting twists and turns, which will hold your attention from the very beginning to the very end. I found myself glued to the screen and completely immersed in the thriller world of the Cold War. I think people interested in spy movies and Cold War history will really appreciate this movie. The movie is also a very strong argument in favor of the idea, that the Cold War was about much more than just politics.\nThe movie is not at all politically biased. It does not try to prove that the US is a great democracy, and Russia is a cruel Stalinist country. It simply tells the story about how it is actually possible to build bridges of understanding between the US and Russia. The main point of the movie is not to defend or attack any country, but only to show how difficult it was to try to help to two countries understand each other. In other words, the movie is a great example of a balanced approach to US and Soviet relations.\nThe movie is entertaining and",

    "A child's stay in foster care on average costs government £19,000, but the foster carer receives a maximum of around £150 a week, less than half of what a minimum wage worker is entitled to.\n\n_Source:_ BBC News Online <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6643834.stm>\n\nWhat is going on here? The article is confusing in terms of its use of quantitative data and its tone of voice. The lead sentence tells us the amount government spends on a child, and that information comes directly from an official source (the government), who has provided cost figures. The lead does not tell us how that figure was derived. However, we learn later in the article that the total cost figure represents average annual costs for each child in care, and those figures, we learn, come from the National Audit Office (NAO). Given this information, we can tell that the lead is somewhat misleading in terms of its numbers. It would have been better for the author to have included this detail (perhaps as part of his first sentence or in a follow-up sentence) instead of leading off with an amount and then using it in the lead as if one person actually took care of each child over the course of a year. The numbers would have looked different if the number referred to average annual costs per child.\n\nThe second sentence contains the second quantitative piece of information, about the money that foster carers receive. Although the maximum for carers has been known for a while (because it is tied to specific benefits), few would dispute the other part of the sentence, that carers receive less than minimum wage. The third sentence refers to information from the government, but this information is not as direct as that provided by NAO. According to the author, the amount of money carers receive is \"below a minimum wage worker is entitled to.\" Now, I don't know about you, but I interpret this sentence to be saying that any worker is entitled to a minimum wage, and the carers are not. This also suggests that the author is trying to make a comparison and, as you would expect, she is going to compare the government support for foster carers and the minimum wage. Unfortunately, she doesn't tell us whether her comparison is going to be an explicit, head-on,",
    "I've been smoking since probably 5th grade. I was a pretty smart kid and got straight As in school so I was always around other smart kids that smoked. I just picked it up.\nI had a pretty intense case of asthma growing up as a kid and it was really scary a lot of the time. The only time I could breath was while I was smoking weed. I thought smoking was going to be this thing that I'd stop doing as I grew older but the asthma has never let go and honestly, I'd rather be high all the time with an inhaler and an air filter than without it. A decade after I picked it up, some friends in the band invited my along to a festival of some sort which is how I got to see Tool so I've had some good times because of weed but the day I started smoking was definitely the day I stopped growing up.\nI've used it as recreational, medicated, and I've smoked for weed. I never thought of it as a problem until a couple of years ago when I really started to try to focus on other things that would help me and I gave up weed for a few months and it really helped me with my depression. I quit for a little while earlier this year but I had been smoking a lot before I quit so I didn't have a great time getting through the cravings so I started a few months ago but I've been smoking a lot less.

    "Hello, I had a dream and I remember that I had it a month ago: I think that I was having the dream in that time, for some reason I can't remember it, but I remember remembering it... In the dream, there was some kind of a war between a group of humans and some kind of an insect. In the middle of one of the battles some powerful figure appeared at the battlefield to see the fight, he had a crown on his head and on his hand, there was a special staff with some unknown magic written on it. \nI tried to find the meaning of my dream a month ago, and I've read a lot of material about what to do, what not to do.\nI have recently come to understand what I have understood. Now I understand that everything that happens in the dream is always something real. \nI also understand that the fact that the dream was repeated a month ago means that I understand all the information I need for the present time. \nIs this true? \nWhat does this dream mean and is there another meaning to it that I am not familiar with? Does some kind of information remain on the staff after the powerful figure appears? \nSincerely.\n\nA: The Dream\nIn my opinion there are many ways of interpreting such a dream. The most obvious interpretation, however, is that you are being put back together again spiritually and physically. The figure in a crown is clearly representing the king - like in chess. There is a board in the background. The war takes place on said board. The staff can be interpreted as a chess piece and the figures can represent various other pieces. The crown is a symbol of royalty.\nThe dream can also represent a war between the physical and spiritual. The war is in the spirit and the material world and on the earth. Thus a kind of 'divine force' will be placed on Earth to help you. There was some kind of crown on top of this figure in the dream and this can symbolize a king or a leader coming to help you. I think this could be Jesus. He is the King of Kings.\nIn addition, the crown on top could represent the crown of victory, as the staff with the strange writing",

Brian Wheeler, who resigned as UKIP leader, has launched his breakaway Veritas party and wants to fight in May's European elections, with candidates being chosen via an online selection process.\"We are seeking legal advice because we don't believe it's constitutional for UKIP to be poaching our brand,\" Mr Wheeler said.The European Parliament election is on 23 May, although the Brexit deadline of the end of that month remains a major stumbling block.But the two breakaway parties are vying to claim the mantle of those wanting \"the Brexit that means Brexit\".\nLast week, former UKIP donor Arron Banks backed the new Brexit Party. He said the party would challenge the Brexiteer mantle and the brand in the EU elections.Former UKIP leader Henry Bolton has said he might stand as a candidate for the party. Mr Bolton joined Mr Wheeler in the party's last leadership election, where they ended up being \"double losers\".Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Wheeler told Sky News' Sophy Ridge On Sunday: \"These people are doing what we did to UKIP.\"He said they were taking Veritas's name and logo and using it to promote what he believes is really the re-launch of the Brexit Party.Veritas means truth, and Mr Wheeler said it had already become \"a buzzword\" in the UK's current affairs.But he was \"not seeking to build a brand out of the Brexit Party name\" and said his party would stand on \"policies, not personalities\".\"There's not a lot of policy in the Brexit Party because they haven't started thinking it yet.\"He added it was unclear to him if Mr Banks had made a \"financial commitment\" to the party, which has not announced how it will get on to the ballot paper.\n\"I don't know whether he's done",

    "\"This is an interesting question. At least, in terms of fortification, Anabasis does at points contradict Arther's (Miles, M R P) book on the Byzantine Army.\nI.E. in Anabasis, it says that the forts were made of stone, and Arther describes them as being built with sod. Now Arther does note about this that sod is often used for temporary buildings, but his description sounds much more like what Anabasis mentions in terms of being built of \"turf and wood\" -- but not sod. The reason I mention that is because, given that the forts were in mountainous regions, the use of turf and wood does seem somewhat more practical. In the lowlands, sod would be more practical.\nArther also describes the forts as being built near water sources, but Anabasis mentions that they are built away from water sources. If this is the case then we do have some archeological evidence. I.E. there is a site on the north slope of Mount Amanus, near the small town of Bostancik, where the site does seem to match Arther and Anabasis. Anabasis does mention that in many occasions the forts are used by villagers. At this site, archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a Byzantine basilica, which seems to have been used as an outpost that guarded the main town, which was situated in a hilltop that commanded a good view of the surrounding region.\nIt should be noted though that a large number of the remains there were Christian and dated to the 6th Century, I believe. This is in line with what Anabasis mentions about the size of the military in this area shrinking in this year -- since as we know, the armies would have to be removed for the Reconquest. However we do know of several forts in the area, and Bostancik was just one.\"\nIf you'd like access to the entire article, as well as any previous posts we've made about this topic, simply click the link below to sign up for our free daily newsletter.

    "I was at a local park, playing with my niece (3 yrs.). She loves to climb the climbing wall and swing set. I've played there with her numerous times, and there's even other aunts/uncles there that also play with her. Today she decides to climb the slide, which I think is a bad idea. She climbs it and my sister stops trying to talk me out of it on a ladder next to it. Well, my niece can't figure out how to get down the slide, she's screaming, and I'm trying to help her get down the slide before she gets hurt. Well, her mom yells at me for telling her daughter that she wasn't smart while going down the slide. I try to explain that her daughter can't figure out how to get down the slide, not that she isn't smart, and her mom tells her daughter that I said she wasn't smart. She then yells at me and calls me names. It was then that my brother finally steps in. He makes her apologize to my niece about calling her a dumbass (I didn't even) and then tells my sister to leave and not come back. After I calmed down, I asked why my niece didn't just try to go down the slide and fall (not get hurt but just fall), and my brother said since she was acting stupid, it would have been better for her to just fall down the hole of the slide and get hurt, but it would have been her own damn fault. I said it's not fair if she does get hurt, since she's not the one being stupid and she can't control it by herself, and he says that no it's not fair, she's not doing anything wrong, I shouldn't have yelled at her, I don't let my niece climb the slide or climb anything in the play place, and I'm just a mean person that wants to get rid of my niece to get rid of my brother's family. I said I would definitely take care of her and he said he would find out what to do if I did something and I said he already should know what to do if anything happened. I just don't see how I'm wrong or why my brother is defending my sister in this. Why is he siding with her on this and not me?\nsubmitted by /",
