    "3D  convolution neural networks (CNN) have  been proved very successful in\nparsing organs or  tumours in 3D medical  images, but it remains  sophisticated\nand  time-consuming to choose or design proper 3D  networks given different task\ncontexts. Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS)  is proposed to  solve this\nproblem by searching for the best network architecture automatically.  However,\nthe inconsistency between  search stage and deployment  stage often exists in NAS\nalgorithms  due to  memory constraints and large search space, which could  become\nmore serious when applying NAS to some memory and  time consuming tasks, such as\n3D medical image segmentation. In this paper,  we propose coarse-to-fine  neural\narchitecture search  (C2FNAS) to automatically search a 3D segmentation network\nfrom scratch  without  inconsistency on network size or input  size. Specifically,\nwe divide the search procedure into two stages: 1)  the coarse stage, where we\nsearch the macro-level  topology  of the network, i.e. how  each convolution\nmodule is connected to other modules; 2)  the fine  stage, where we  search at\nmicro-level for operations in each cell based on   previous searched macro-level\ntopology. The  coarse-to-fine  manner divides the search procedure into two\nconsecutive stages and meanwhile resolves  the inconsistency. We evaluate our\nmethod on 10 public datasets from  Medical Segmentation Decalthon (MSD)\nchallenge, and achieve state-of-the-art performance with the network searched\nusing one dataset,  which   demonstrates  the effectiveness and generalization  of\nour searched models.

    "Region-based methods have proven necessary  for improving segmentation\naccuracy of  neuronal structures  in electron microscopy (EM) images. Most\nregion-based segmentation methods use a scoring function to determine region\nmerging. Such functions  are usually  learned with supervised algorithms that\ndemand considerable  ground truth data, which are costly  to collect.  We propose\na semi-supervised approach that reduces this  demand. Based on   a merge tree\nstructure, we develop a differentiable unsupervised loss  term  that enforces\nconsistent predictions   from the   learned function. We then propose a Bayesian\nmodel that combines the  supervised and the unsupervised information for\nprobabilistic learning. The  experimental results  on three EM data sets\ndemonstrate  that by  using a subset of only  3% to 7% of the entire ground truth\ndata, our approach consistently performs close to the  state-of-the-art\nsupervised method with the  full labeled data set,  and significantly outperforms\nthe supervised method with the same labeled subset.",
    "In  Computer  Vision, edge detection  is one   of the favored approaches for\nfeature and object detection in  images since  it provides information  about\ntheir objects boundaries. Other region-based  approaches use  probabilistic\nanalysis such as clustering and  Markov random fields, but those methods cannot\nbe used to analyze edges and their  interaction. In fact, only  image\nsegmentation can produce regions based on edges, but it requires thresholding\nby simply separating the regions into binary in-out  information. Hence, there\nis currently a gap between edge-based and region-based algorithms, since edges\ncannot be used to study  the properties of  a region and vice versa. The\nobjective of  this  paper is to present a novel  spatial probability analysis that\nallows determining the probability of inclusion   inside a set of partial\ncontours (strokes).  To answer this objective,   we developed a new  approach that\nuses electromagnetic  convolutions and repulsion optimization to compute the\nrequired probabilities. Hence, it  becomes possible   to  generate a continuous\nspace of probability based only on  the edge information, thus bridging  the gap\nbetween the edge-based methods and the region-based methods. The developed\nmethod  is  consistent with the fundamental properties of inclusion probabilities\nand its results are validated by comparing an image with the probability-based\nestimation given by our algorithm. The method can also  be  generalized to take\ninto consideration  the intensity of the edges or to be used for 3D shapes. This\nis  the first documented method  that allows computing a  space of  probability\nbased on interacting  edges,  which  opens the path  to broader applications such\nas image segmentation and contour completion.

    "    In this manuscript we give an extension of  the classic Salem--Zygmund\ninequality for locally sub-Gaussian random variables. As an application,  the\nconcentration of  the roots of a Kac  polynomial is studied, which is the  main\ncontribution of this manuscript. More  precisely,  we assume the existence of the\nmoment generating  function for the iid random coefficients for  the Kac\npolynomial and prove that there exists an annulus of  width \\[O(n^{-2}(\\log\nn)^{-1/2-\\gamma}), \\quad \\gamma>1/2\\] around the unit  circle that does not\ncontain roots with  high probability. As  an another application,   we show that\nthe smallest  singular value of a random circulant matrix is  at least\n$n^{-\\rho}$,  $\\rho\\in(0,1/4)$ with probability $1-O(n^{-2\\rho})$.\n",
    "   Chirped  Bessel waves are introduced as stable (non-diffracting)  solutions of\nthe paraxial  wave  equation in optical antiguides with a power-law radial\nvariation in their index of refraction. Through  numerical simulations,  we\ninvestigate the propagation of   apodized (finite-energy) versions of such  waves,\nwith or   without vorticity, in  antiguides with practical parameters. The new\nwaves exhibit  a  remarkable resistance against the defocusing effect of the\nunstable index potentials,  outperforming standard Gaussians with the  same full\nwidth at half maximum.  The chirped profile persists even under conditions of\neccentric launching or antiguide bending and is also capable of self-healing\nlike standard diffraction-free beams in free  space.\n",
    "We present an interactive   approach to train a  deep neural network pixel\nclassifier for the segmentation of  neuronal structures.  An interactive training\nscheme reduces the extremely tedious manual annotation task that is  typically\nrequired for deep networks to perform well on image segmentation problems. Our\nproposed  method employs a feedback loop  that captures sparse  annotations using\na graphical   user interface, trains a deep neural network based on recent and\npast  annotations,  and displays the prediction output  to users in almost\nreal-time. Our implementation of the algorithm also allows multiple users to\nprovide annotations in parallel    and receive  feedback from  the same classifier.\nQuick feedback  on classifier  performance in an interactive setting enables\nusers to identify and label  examples that are more important  than others for\nsegmentation purposes. Our experiments show that an interactively-trained pixel\nclassifier produces  better region segmentation results on Electron Microscopy\n(EM)  images than  those  generated by a network of the same architecture trained\noffline on  exhaustive ground-truth labels.

    "A functional for  joint  variational object segmentation and shape matching is\ndeveloped. The formulation is based  on  optimal transport w.r.t.  geometric\ndistance and local feature  similarity. Geometric invariance and modelling of\nobject-typical statistical variations is achieved by introducing degrees of\nfreedom that describe  transformations  and deformations of the shape template.\nThe shape model is mathematically equivalent to  contour-based approaches but\ninference can be performed without conversion between the  contour and  region\nrepresentations,  allowing  combination with other  convex segmentation  approaches\nand  simplifying optimization. While the overall functional is non-convex,\nnon-convexity is confined  to a low-dimensional variable. We propose a  locally\noptimal alternating optimization scheme and a  globally optimal branch and bound\nscheme, based on adaptive convex relaxation.  Combining both methods allows  to\neliminate  the delicate initialization problem inherent  to many  contour based\napproaches while remaining computationally practical.  The properties of the\nfunctional,  its ability to adapt to a  wide range of input data structures  and\nthe  different optimization schemes are illustrated and compared by numerical\nexperiments.",
    "The task of image segmentation is inherently  noisy due to ambiguities\nregarding  the exact location  of boundaries between anatomical structures. We\nargue that this information can be extracted from  the  expert  annotations at no\nextra cost, and when integrated into state-of-the-art neural  networks, it  can\nlead to   improved calibration  between soft probabilistic predictions  and the\nunderlying uncertainty. We built upon label  smoothing (LS) where a network is\ntrained on 'blurred' versions of the   ground truth labels  which has been shown\nto be effective  for calibrating  output predictions. However, LS is not  taking\nthe local structure into account  and results in overly  smoothed  predictions\nwith low confidence even for non-ambiguous regions. Here, we propose Spatially\nVarying Label Smoothing (SVLS), a  soft  labeling technique that captures the\nstructural uncertainty in semantic segmentation. SVLS also  naturally lends\nitself to incorporate inter-rater uncertainty when multiple  labelmaps are\navailable. The  proposed approach is extensively validated on four  clinical\nsegmentation  tasks with different imaging modalities,  number of classes and\nsingle and multi-rater expert annotations. The  results demonstrate that  SVLS,\ndespite its  simplicity, obtains superior boundary prediction with improved\nuncertainty and model calibration.",
    "Deep Learning (DL) models are becoming larger, because the increase in model\nsize might offer significant  accuracy gain. To enable the training of large\ndeep networks, data parallelism and  model  parallelism are two well-known\napproaches for  parallel  training. However, data parallelism does not help\nreduce memory footprint per device. In this work,  we introduce Large  deep  3D\nConvNets with Automated Model  Parallelism (LAMP) and investigate the impact  of\nboth input's and deep 3D ConvNets'  size on segmentation  accuracy.  Through\nautomated   model  parallelism, it is feasible to train large deep 3D  ConvNets\nwith a large input patch, even the whole image. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that,  facilitated by  the automated model parallelism,  the\nsegmentation  accuracy can  be improved through increasing   model size and input\ncontext size, and  large input yields significant inference speedup compared\nwith sliding window of small patches in the inference.

    "  In this paper we come back to  a problem proposed  by  F. Hirzebruch in the\n1980's,  namely whether there exists a configuration of smooth  conics in  the\ncomplex  projective plane such  that the associated desingularization of the\nKummer extension is a ball quotient. We extend our considerations to the\nso-called $d$-configurations of   curves on  the  projective plane and we show that\nin most  cases for a given  configuration the associated desingularization  of the\nKummer extension is not a ball quotient. Moreover, we provide improved versions\nof Hirzebruch-type  inequality  for $d$-configurations. Finally, we show that  the\nso-called characteristic numbers  (or $\\gamma$ numbers) for $d$-configurations\nare bounded from above by $8/3$. At the  end of the paper  we give some  examples\nof surfaces constructed via Kummer extensions branched  along conic\nconfigurations.\n ",
    "Medical  image  analysis, especially segmenting a specific organ,  has an\nimportant role in developing clinical  decision support systems. In cardiac\nmagnetic resonance (MR)  imaging, segmenting  the left and right ventricles helps\nphysicians diagnose different heart abnormalities. There  are challenges for\nthis task, including  the intensity and shape similarity between left ventricle\nand  other organs, inaccurate boundaries and presence  of noise in most  of  the\nimages. In this paper we propose an automated method for segmenting the left\nventricle in   cardiac MR images. We first automatically extract the   region of\ninterest, and then employ it as an input of a fully convolutional network. We\ntrain the network  accurately despite the small number of left ventricle pixels\nin comparison with  the  whole image. Thresholding on the output map of  the  fully\nconvolutional network  and selection of regions based on   their roundness are\nperformed in our   proposed post-processing phase. The Dice score of our  method\nreaches 87.24% by applying  this algorithm on the  York dataset  of heart images.",
    "  We define and investigate, via numerical analysis, a one dimensional\ntoy-model of a cloud chamber. An energetic quantum particle, whose initial\nstate   is  a superposition of two identical wave packets with opposite  average\nmomentum, interacts during its  evolution and  exchanges (small amounts of)\nenergy   with    an array of localized spins. Triggered by the interaction with  the\nenvironment,  the initial  superposition state turns into an incoherent sum of\ntwo  states  describing the following situation:  or the  particle is going to the\nleft and a large number of spins  on the left side  changed their states, or the\nsame is   happening on the right side. This evolution is reminiscent   of what\nhappens in a cloud chamber where  a quantum  particle, emitted as a  spherical\nwave by a radioactive source, marks its passage inside a supersaturated\nvapour-chamber in the form of a sequence of small liquid bubbles arranging\nthemselves around  a possible classical trajectory of the particle.\n",
    "  Text data is often seen as \"take-away\" materials with little noise and  easy\nto process information. Main questions are how to get data and transform them\ninto  a good document format. But data can be sensitive  to noise oftenly called\nambiguities.  Ambiguities are  aware from  a  long time,  mainly because polysemy  is\nobvious in language and context is required to remove uncertainty.  I  claim  in\nthis paper  that syntactic  context is not  suffisant to improve interpretation.\nIn  this paper I  try to explain that firstly noise can come from   natural data\nthemselves, even involving high technology, secondly texts, seen as verified\nbut meaningless, can  spoil content  of a corpus;  it may lead to contradictions\nand background noise.\n",
    "While  accelerators such as GPUs have  limited memory,  deep neural networks  are\nbecoming larger and will not fit with the memory limitation of accelerators for\ntraining. We  propose an approach to tackle this problem by rewriting the\ncomputational graph  of  a neural network, in which swap-out and swap-in\noperations are inserted to temporarily store intermediate results on CPU\nmemory.  In  particular, we  first revise the concept of a computational graph by\ndefining a concrete semantics for variables in a  graph. We then formally show\nhow to derive swap-out  and swap-in  operations from an existing graph and\npresent rules to optimize the graph. To realize our   approach, we developed a\nmodule in TensorFlow,  named TFLMS.  TFLMS  is published as  a pull request in the\nTensorFlow  repository for contributing to the TensorFlow community. With TFLMS,\nwe were able to  train ResNet-50  and 3DUnet with 4.7x and 2x larger batch size,\nrespectively. In particular, we were able to train 3DUNet using images of  size\nof   $192^3$  for image  segmentation, which, without  TFLMS, had been done only  by\ndividing   the images to smaller images, which  affects  the  accuracy.",

    "Clustering is  an important facet of explorative data mining and finds\nextensive use in several fields. In  this paper, we  propose  an extension of the\nclassical  Fuzzy C-Means  clustering  algorithm. The proposed algorithm,\nabbreviated as VFC, adopts a multi-dimensional membership vector for each data\npoint instead of the traditional, scalar  membership value defined in the\noriginal algorithm.  The membership vector for each  point is  obtained by\nconsidering each feature of that point separately and obtaining individual\nmembership values for  the  same. We also propose  an algorithm  to  efficiently\nallocate the initial  cluster centers close to the actual  centers, so  as to\nfacilitate rapid convergence. Further, we propose a scheme to achieve crisp\nclustering using the  VFC algorithm. The proposed,  novel clustering  scheme has\nbeen tested on two standard data sets in order to analyze  its performance.

    "Real-time semantic video segmentation is a challenging task  due to the   strict\nrequirements of inference speed. Recent approaches mainly devote  great efforts\nto reducing the  model size  for high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink this\nproblem from a different viewpoint:  using knowledge  contained in compressed\nvideos.  We  propose a simple and effective framework,  dubbed  TapLab, to  tap into\nresources from the  compressed domain. Specifically, we design a fast feature\nwarping module using motion vectors for acceleration.

    "  We present near-infrared spectroscopic observations of  the high-intensity HeI\n10830 emission line in 45 low-metallicity HII regions. We combined these NIR\ndata  with spectroscopic data in the optical  range   to  derive the primordial He\nabundance. The use of the HeI 10830A line, the intensity of which is  very\nsensitive  to the density of the  HII region, greatly improves the determination\nof the physical conditions  in the He^+ zone. This results in a  considerably\ntighter Y - O/H linear regression compared to all previous studies.

    "Extracting a  connectome from an electron microscopy (EM) data  set requires\nidentification of neurons  and determination of synapses between neurons. As\nmanual extraction of this  information is very  time-consuming, there has been\nextensive  research effort to automatically segment the neurons  to help guide\nand eventually   replace  manual tracing. Until recently,  there  has been\ncomparatively less  research on  automatically   detecting  the actual synapses\nbetween neurons.  This discrepancy can, in part, be attributed to several\nfactors: obtaining neuronal shapes is a prerequisite first step  in extracting  a\nconnectome, manual  tracing is much  more time-consuming than annotating\nsynapses,  and  neuronal contact area can  be used as  a  proxy for  synapses in\ndetermining connections.\n   However,  recent research has demonstrated that contact area alone is not a\nsufficient predictor of synaptic connection. Moreover, as segmentation has\nimproved, we have observed that synapse annotation is consuming a more\nsignificant  fraction of overall reconstruction time.  This ratio will only get\nworse as segmentation improves, gating overall possible speed-up. Therefore, we\naddress this problem by developing algorithms  that automatically detect\npre-synaptic neurons and their post-synaptic  partners.  In particular,\npre-synaptic structures are detected  using a Deep and Wide  Multiscale Recursive\nNetwork, and post-synaptic partners are detected using a MLP with features\nconditioned  on the  local segmentation.\n  This work is  novel because it  requires minimal amount of training,  leverages\nadvances  in image segmentation directly, and provides a complete solution for\npolyadic synapse  detection.

It\nis  argued that when permittivity  is temperature independent over a  temperature\ninterval including zero temperature, a cavity made of causal  material with\ncontinuous dispersion properties separated by vacuum cannot  violate Nernst's\ntheorem  (the third  law of  thermodynamics). The purported violation of this\ntheorem pertains to divergencies in the  double limit  in which frequency and\ntemperature vanish simultaneously. While any model should abide  by the laws of\nthermodynamics within   its  range of applicability, we emphasise that the  Nernst\nheat  theorem is a  relevant criterion for choosing amongst  candidate  theories\nonly when these theories are fully applicable at  zero temperature and\nfrequency.\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the de  facto  standard  for\nnowadays 3D medical image segmentation. The convolutional operations used  in\nthese networks, however, inevitably have limitations in modeling the long-range\ndependency due to their inductive  bias of locality and weight sharing.  Although\nTransformer was born   to address this issue, it suffers from extreme\ncomputational  and spatial complexities in processing high-resolution 3D feature\nmaps. In this paper, we propose  a novel framework that efficiently bridges  a\n{\\bf Co}nvolutional neural network and a {\\bf Tr}ansformer {\\bf (CoTr)} for\naccurate  3D medical image segmentation. Under this framework, the CNN is\nconstructed  to  extract feature representations  and an  efficient deformable\nTransformer (DeTrans) is built to  model the long-range  dependency   on  the\nextracted feature maps. Different  from the vanilla Transformer which treats all\nimage positions equally,  our DeTrans pays attention  only to a   small set  of key\npositions by introducing the deformable self-attention mechanism. Thus, the\ncomputational and spatial complexities of DeTrans have been greatly reduced,\nmaking it possible to process the multi-scale   and  high-resolution feature maps,\nwhich are usually of paramount importance for image  segmentation. We conduct an\nextensive evaluation on  the Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the  Cranial  Vault (BCV)\ndataset that covers  11 major human organs.

    "Dilated convolutions are widely used in deep semantic  segmentation models as\nthey can enlarge the filters'  receptive field without adding additional  weights\nnor sacrificing spatial resolution. However, as  dilated convolutional filters\ndo not possess positional knowledge about the pixels on semantically meaningful\ncontours, they could lead to   ambiguous predictions on  object boundaries. In\naddition, although dilating the  filter can expand its receptive field, the\ntotal number of sampled   pixels remains unchanged, which usually  comprises a\nsmall  fraction of the receptive field's total area. Inspired by the  Lateral\nInhibition (LI) mechanisms  in human visual systems, we propose the dilated\nconvolution with lateral inhibitions (LI-Convs)  to overcome  these limitations.\nIntroducing  LI mechanisms improves the convolutional filter's  sensitivity to\nsemantic object  boundaries.

Estimating the precise boundary   of traffic\nsigns is   important in  navigation systems for intelligent vehicles where traffic\nsigns can be  used  as 3D  landmarks  for road environment. Previous traffic sign\ndetection systems, including recent methods based on CNN, only  provide bounding\nboxes of traffic  signs as  output, and thus requires additional processes  such\nas contour  estimation or  image segmentation  to obtain the precise sign\nboundary.

We first introduce a fractional gradient flow with\ndiscrete normalization and then discretize it by using the trapezoidal type\nquadrature rule   in space and the semi-implicit Euler method in time. Our method\ncan  be  used to compute the ground and  first excited states not only in the\nlinear cases but  also in the nonlinear cases.

    " The book opens with scenes of astonishing  opulence, beginning with Renée and Maxime lazing in a luxurious horse-drawn carriage, very slowly leaving  a Parisian park (the Bois de Boulogne) in  the 19th century-equivalent of a traffic jam. It is made clear very early on that  these are  staggeringly wealthy characters  not  subject to  the cares  faced by the public; they arrive at their mansion and spend hours being dressed by their servants prior  to hosting a banquet    attended by some of the  richest people in Paris. There seems to be almost no continuity between this scene and the  end of the previous novel, until the  second chapter begins and Zola  reveals that this opulent scene takes  place almost fourteen years later. Zola then rewinds time to pick up the story  practically minutes  after La Fortune  des Rougon ended. Following Eugene Rougon's  rise  to  political power  in  Paris in  La  Fortune, his younger  brother Aristide, featured in the first novel   as a talentless journalist, a comic character unable to commit himself unequivocally to the imperial cause and thus left  out  in the cold when the rewards  were being handed  out, decides to follow Eugene to Paris to help himself  to  the  wealth and power he now believes to  be his birthright. Eugene  promises to help   Aristide achieve these things on the condition that he stay out of his way and change his  surname to avoid the possibility of bad publicity from Aristide's  escapades rubbing   off on Eugene and damaging his  political  chances. Aristide chooses the surname Saccard and  Eugene gets him a seemingly mundane job at the  city planning permission office. The renamed  Saccard soon realises that, far  from   the disappointment he thought   the   job would be, he is actually in a position  to gain insider  information on the houses  and other buildings that are  to be demolished to build Paris's bold new system of boulevards. Knowing that  the owners of these properties ordered to be demolished by the city government were compensated handsomely,  Saccard   contrives to borrow money  in  order to buy up these properties before their  status becomes public  and then make massive profits.  Saccard is at first unable to get the money to make his initial investments but  then  his wife falls victim to a terminal illness. Even while she lies dying in the next   room, Saccard (in a   brilliant scene of  breathtaking callousness) is already making  arrangements to marry  rich girl Renée, who is  pregnant and whose family  wishes to  avoid scandal  by offering a huge dowry to any man who  will marry  her  and claim  the baby as his  own.  Saccard accepts and his career in  speculation is born.  He sends his youngest daughter back home to    Plassans and packs his older son   Maxime off to a  Parisian boarding school; we meet  Maxime again when he leaves school several  years later and  meets his  new  stepmother  Renée, who is only a  couple of years older. The flashback complete, the rest  of the novel takes place after Saccard has made his fortune, against the backdrop of his luxurious mansion and his profligacy and is concerned  with a three-cornered plot of sexual  and political intrigue. Renée and Maxime begin  a  semi-incestuous love affair, which Saccard suspects but  appears to tolerate,  perhaps due to the commercial  nature of his  marriage to Renée. Saccard is trying to get Renée to  part with the deeds to her family home, which would be worth millions but which she refuses to  give up. The  novel continues in this vein  with the tensions continuing  to mount and culminates in  a series of   bitter observations by Zola on the hypocrisy  and immorality of the nouveau riche. A   near-penniless journalist at the time of writing  La  Curée, Zola himself had no experience   of the  scenes he describes. In order to counter this lack, he toured a large number of stately homes around France, taking copious notes on subjects like architecture, ladies' and men's fashions, jewellery, garden  design, greenhouse plants (a seduction scene takes place  in Saccard's hothouse), carriages, mannerisms, servants' liveries;   these notes (volumes of which are preserved) were time well spent, as many contemporary observers praised the  novel  for its realism. Roger  Vadim updated  the setting to  modern-day Paris in a   movie adaptation by  Jean Cau, starring Jane Fonda, Michel  Piccoli  and Peter McEnery  in 1966. The film  was released in English-speaking markets as The Game is Over.",
    " The plot is  based around  the character Beverley who remembers  his childhood days with his brother Felix and  friends and cousins Felicity, Cecily, Dan, Sara Stanley (the \"Story Girl\"), hired-boy  Peter and neighbor Sara Ray. The  children often  played  in their family's  orchard and had many adventures, even creating their  own newspaper, called Our Magazine.  More character  development takes place  in this  novel  than in its predecessor,  and the reader is  able  to watch the children grow up;  in particular,  they are able to watch Sara Stanley leave  the  Golden  Road of childhood  forever.  They also are able to see the beginnings of a relationship between Peter and Felicity, as chemistry between them starts to build;  it also seems that Beverly and Sara Stanley  are drawn to each   other, but this is left undeveloped. Throughout the story it is  hinted that  Beverly's cousin, Cecily, is consumptive; in a passage where the Story Girl  tells their  futures, the adult  Beverly confirms  that Cecily  never left the Golden Road. As well, she strongly hints that Peter and Felicity will be  married. The novel ends after  Sara's father collects her  to give her a proper education, and their small group is never complete again.

    "  Crystal, the  only  daughter of the  old, long-exiled haughty  royalist, the  Comte de Cambray, is on the  eve of betrothal to de  Marmont, (secretly an ardent Bonapartist). Bobby Clyffurde, the  Englishman, who is in love with Crystal, confronts Victor de Marmont about why he is pretending to be  a royalist. De  Marmont replies that he  has  never led the Comte to suppose anything, the Comte has merely taken de  Marmont’s political convictions for granted. As  if two   potential suitors   weren’t enough, Crystal has yet another admirer, Maurice de St. Genis, whose impecunious state (her father sees  him as a penniless, out-at-elbows, good for nothing)  has  precluded him from  obtaining her hand in  marriage. Howeve at the moment of  Crystal’s betrothal to de  Marmont,  Maurice  finally  gets his revenge upon his rival. Once the guests have assembled for the ceremony, there  is a disturbance  from the end of the corridor and St. Genis enters  the room, his rough clothes and muddy boots providing a contrast  to the immaculate get-up of the Comte’s guests. Looking flushed and clutching  his cane he announces that he has only come to avert the awful catastrophe that is about  to fall on the Comte  and his family. At the young  man’s ominous words, M. le Comte  goes  pale and  demands to  know what catastrophe  could be worse than  twenty years of  exile? \"An alliance with   a traitor, M. le Comte\" he replies. St. Genis goes on  to accuse  his rival of pinning Napoleon’s  proclamation on the  walls  of Grenoble. Yet, rather than deny the accusation de Marmont defends his actions with fervor, pulling a copy of the declaration from his pocket and waving it at the assembled  group   while shouting “Vive l’Empereur”. Despite  the sudden  rupture of her engagement, Crystal‘s  heart is  by no means broken, but it is not  St.  Genis who in the end  wins her love, for  we   are left with the  understanding that it is  Clyffurde,  the English merchant who eventually overrides the prejudices of the old French count. Clyffurde laughingly asks Crystal’s aunt, Mme. la Duchesse “Do you  think that  if I promise never to buy or sell  gloves again, but  in  future to try and  live like a  gentleman-he will consent?”",
    " Duff Pringle is heading  across  the country, aiming  for his  new job in technology in   California's  Silicon Valley. His used Ford Escort barely makes it a hundred miles from  home before breaking   down. He calls a  car towing company to come pick  him up, and when they  get to the  repair center, the car would need to stay  3–4 days. Duff only has 2  weeks to  get to  California. Duff checks in to a motel, thinking  he would stay the 3–4 days, and soon finds a note asking for someone to drive a car to St. Louis.

    " The Golden Notebook is  the story of writer Anna Wulf,  the four  notebooks in  which she keeps the record of  her life, and her attempt to   tie them all together in a fifth, gold-colored notebook.  The book intersperses segments of an   ostensibly realistic narrative of the  lives  of Molly and Anna, and their children, ex-husbands and lovers—entitled  Free Women—with  excerpts from Anna's four notebooks, coloured  black (of Anna's experience in Southern Rhodesia, before and during WWII, which inspired her own bestselling novel), red (of her experience as a member of the  Communist Party), yellow (an ongoing novel  that is being   written based on the  painful ending of Anna's own love affair),  and  blue (Anna's personal journal where she records her memories, dreams, and emotional   life). Each  notebook is returned to four times, interspersed with episodes from Free  Women, creating non-chronological, overlapping sections  that interact with one another. This post-modernistic styling, with its space and room for \"play\"  engaging the  characters and readers, is  among   the most famous features of the book, although Lessing insisted that  readers and  reviewers pay  attention to the  serious themes in the  novel.",
    " New York City, summer 1944.  Although she  runs a successful private  psychiatric clinic  on New York's   Park Avenue, Dr. Charlotte Manning &mdash; young, beautiful, blonde, and well-to-do &mdash; cannot get enough. In  order to  increase her profit, she gets involved  with  a group of criminals &mdash; a \"syndicate\"  &mdash; specialising in both prostitution and drug-trafficking.  The    brains of the \"outfit\"  is Hal Kines,  who has had  plastic  surgery   so that he looks  much younger than he really is, this being how he  gets hold of the young women whom he  then turns into prostitutes.  Manning  herself has a rich and \"ritzy\" clientele &mdash; people  who would  not want their addiction  to  become public knowledge. But instead of weaning them off drugs in her private and  exclusive  clinic, Manning makes them even more dependent on both the drug &mdash; heroin in most cases &mdash;   and on herself by procuring the stuff herself.  On the  surface, Charlotte Manning keeps up  appearances and leads a  respectable life  as a renowned psychiatrist.  When Jack Williams, a former  New York  cop who has lost  an arm  in World War II saving his friend Mike Hammer's life, falls in love  with  Myrna Devlin, a young heroin addict whom he stops from  jumping off a bridge to commit suicide, he  asks Manning  to admit   her  to her clinic for psychotherapy. After Myrna has become clean, she  and Williams   become engaged, and the couple keep up a  casual friendship with Charlotte  Manning. This is how Williams's growing suspicions about Manning's business lead him to  privately  and secretly investigate even further into the matter. When he  realizes that Hal Kines, one  of  Manning's college students who has  spent some time at her clinic  and who has become one of her casual acquaintances, is in fact a criminal,   he  wants to talk to her about it and tells her   so. When, at a  party given  by Williams in his apartment, Charlotte Manning sees some old college yearbooks whose   contents (and photos),  if made public,  would  expose Kines's double life, she has to act  fast. After  the party, she goes home but on the same  night, undetected by  Kathy, her maid, goes back to Williams's apartment (Myrna, his fiancée, does not live there) and shoots him  in the stomach using  a silencer. She does so  in  a particularly  sadistic  way, watching  him die slowly. Then she  takes the college yearbooks and leaves. None of the guests at Williams's party has  a watertight alibi, but to both Pat Chambers,  the cop investigating  the murder, and Mike  Hammer,  a  friend of his and private investigator, none  of them has a  motive either. Throughout the book, as more and more  immediate suspects are eliminated (shot) (\"If this kept up there wouldn't be anyone left at all.\"), Hammer briefly ponders  the  question if the killer could be an  \"outsider\" &mdash; someone wholly unrelated to  the  group of people who have been at Williams's party,  for example someone Williams  was after in his capacity as investigator for an  insurance company. Chambers also  thinks  along similar lines: Williams's (secret) connection  with Myrna's former drug dealers might have cost him his life. But they  soon abandon that theory. When Mike Hammer sees Williams's  body (\"For the first time in my life I felt like crying\"), he makes a solemn  vow: He promises that he  will find the murderer and execute him himself, avoiding the U.S. judicial system altogether. He  says that if he left it to the courts to punish the perpetrator, some clever lawyer would  surely achieve an acquittal and the murderer would  get away with his crime. This is why he himself  will  be  the jury &ndash;  and the judge,  for that matter. Throughout their basically separate investigations, Hammer and Chambers work closely together, exchanging information  and evidence. But each of them hopes he will be the  one to find the  killer in the end.  The immediate suspects Hammer finds himself confronted with  are: * Esther and Mary  Bellemy, identical twins  in their late twenties living in a New  York  apartment hotel, rather  attractive  women of independent means, with a large estate somewhere in the country.  Both are unmarried  and obviously looking for husbands. Later, Hammer finds out &mdash; through first-hand experience &mdash; that Mary Bellemy is  a nymphomaniac. Esther Bellemy, whom he never gets to know  intimately, is  no virgin  either, but  much  more  reserved than her sister  Mary, with whom Hammer actually has sex on    two separate occasions. * George   Kalecki,  whom Hammer knows to have been a crook &mdash; a bootlegger, to be precise &mdash;   but who has obviously achieved a clean record and who now appears to  be Hal Kines's paternal friend,  paying for  the latter's tuition and giving him  food and lodging. (In  fact it is   the   other way round: Hal Kines, the \"big shot\" and the brains of the  syndicate,  has a  hold on Kalecki:  Hidden away   in  the vaults of some bank he has documents proving that Kalecki is a killer on the loose.) * Hal  Kines, who  poses as a student of medicine but who is in  fact the head  of a criminal  organisation specializing in prostitution  and drug-dealing. His very  sophisticated &mdash; and complicated &mdash;  way of procuring willing women  for   his \"outfit\" can only  be understood  if one considers the morally repressed society of the late 1940s: Again and again, he assumes the role of John Hanson, a student in some provincial college  (for example in the Midwest),  pretends falling in love with  a female student, makes her  pregnant,  forces  her to have an illegal  abortion, and then deserts her. By now  the girl's  life  has been ruined, she  has been ostracized by both her family  and most likely all  her friends and acquaintances. Then a car arrives,  picks up the desperate young woman and drives her   straight to one of the New York \"call houses\" operated  by his syndicate. Once  there, there is  no  way for her to  escape. * Charlotte Manning, with whom Hammer  falls in love and who, as   far as he can see, has no motive whatsoever to kill  Williams.  Hammer,  the first person narrator of the story, describes her as \"radiating sex in every  manner and gesture\"  (\"Mary  [Bellemy] only had sex. Charlotte had that  plus a lot more.\"). Charlotte confesses her love   for him, and he says that he has never been in love before. Soon they talk about getting married. Hammer has always   admired her \"golden hair\"; but not before  the very end, when she  strips, does he find  out that Charlotte is a \"real blonde\". In the course of the action Charlotte  Manning kills five  people:   After committing her  first murder, she has  to cover up her  tracks and murder anyone who might be able to expose her. As   Hammer admits, she has  an unusual amount of luck helping her to do all that. *  Myrna Devlin, a former  \"dope  fiend\" who, as it turns out, does not play  any important  role in the plot at all except that of one of the victims: At the Bellemys' party (towards  the end of the book), Myrna, alone in an upstairs room where most  of   the guests have left their  coats, tries  on Charlotte Manning's   coat and discovers  heroin in one  of its pockets.  This is  the  reason why Manning has to  shoot her, too. It  takes Hammer and   Chambers a  long time to  figure out what is going on. Manning continues  to kill those  who have become dangerous for her.  At the  same time, her relationship with Hammer deepens. We see everything  through Hammer's eyes,  and  for a long time he is completely blind  to the facts (\"I hope  you  get him,' she said sincerely.\"). During a walk through Central Park, while Manning  is baby-sitting for one of her friends, she and Hammer are shot at. The sniper is Kalecki, but it  does not become clear  until  later that he was  after Manning. He misses.  On  a Saturday morning,  Hammer  picks  up Myrna  Devlin and gives her a lift. They drive to the Bellemy twins' estate   in the  country for  a gigantic all-day party there. Charlotte Manning says she has some business to attend to and will be  there in time for  a  tennis game due to take place that  evening.  After  an unsuccessful attempt at playing tennis himself,  Hammer gets rid of his sleep deficit  by spending all day in  his room, fast asleep, with \"old  junior\" &mdash; his gun  &mdash; close to him. He is woken up  just in time for dinner, during  which Harmon Wilder,  the Bellemys' lawyer, and  Charles  Sherman, Wilder's  assistant, are pointed out to him. This is a fine &mdash; and the final &mdash; distractor in the novel: Wilder and Sherman are suddenly missing from the party after Myrna Devlin has  been  found shot. In fact  they had  illicit drugs on them and  did not want to  be found out. During  the tennis game, Mary Bellemy asks Charlotte if she can \"borrow\"  Hammer.  Then she leads him into the woods where they have sex. They return to the party just as a maid discovers Myrna's body  in an upstairs room, in  front of a large mirror. Both  Pat Chambers and the police   are called  in, and  the  alibis of each  guest is checked.  Again Charlotte can convince  everyone that  she could not have done anything. Back home, Hammer retreats   into his  apartment to think. Finally, he knows  the identity of the  killer. This is  when  he goes to Charlotte's place, recapitulates the whole crime and finally shoots her dead, despite her efforts to pull the trigger on  him.",

He settles on the latter discovering it has been placed  by Star, a  stunningly gorgeous woman he  had previously met on Île du Levant. Star informs  him that  he is the one to embark on a perilous quest to retrieve  the Egg  of the Phoenix. When she asks what to call  him, he wants to suggest Scarface, referring to  the scar on his face,  but  she stops him  as he is saying \"Oh, Scar...\" and repeats   this as \"Oscar\", and  thus gives him his new name. Along with Rufo, her assistant, who appears to be a man in his fifties, they tread the \"Glory  Road\" in swashbuckling style,  slaying minotaurs, dragons, and other creatures.  Shortly before  the final quest for the Egg itself, Oscar and Star get married. The  team then proceeds to enter  the  tower in which the Egg has been hidden, navigating  a  maze of illusions  and  optical  tricks. Oscar scouts ahead and finds himself crossing swords with  a fearsome  foe  who resembles Cyrano  de Bergerac. He then defeats  the final guardian of the Egg, known only as the \"Never-Born\", in a mental fight, and the party escapes  with the Egg.  While  they arrive in  the  universe of Star, Rufo informs Oscar  that Star is actually the empress  of many worlds—and Rufo's grandmother.   The Egg is a cybernetic  device that contains the knowledge and  experiences of most of  her predecessors.

She has  Oscar unknowingly receive the same  treatments. Initially, Oscar enjoys his new-found  prestige and luxurious life as the  husband of the empress of worlds across the Twenty Universes. However, as time goes on, he  grows bored and feels out of place and useless. When he  demands Star's professional judgment, she tells him that he  must leave;  her  world has no place or need for a hero of his stature. It will be decades before  she can complete the transfer of the  knowledge held in the Egg,  so  he must go alone. He  returns to Earth,  but has difficulty readjusting to his own  world, despite  having brought great wealth along  with  him.  He begins to doubt his own sanity and  whether the  adventure even happened.  The  story ends as he is contacted by  Rufo  to  set up   another trip on the Glory Road, which is,  by this  point, revealed as an allegory  for Life's  Adventure.",

    "  After terrorists bomb the Israeli embassy in Rome, agents at Israel’s intelligence service—better known as the Office—struggle to  determine  a precise motive  for   the attack. The investigation uncovers a  CD  filled with highly sensitive information about Gabriel Allon, a legendary hit  man for the Office.  No longer safe outside of Israel, Gabriel returns reluctantly to his homeland with Italian girlfriend and  fellow Office  agent Chiara  Zolli. Lev,  the current director of the Office, has long resented Gabriel’s close  ties to Ari Shamron,  former director of  the Office,  as well as his recent clandestine work for Shamron. Lev  demands that Gabriel officially rejoin  the Office so he can benefit from the protection of  other agents. However,   Gabriel and Shamron  also recognize that Lev seeks to control and curtail their secret operations. Lev instructs Gabriel to  remain  in  Israel and assigns him  a research team  to investigate the bombing and its link  to  Gabriel. Thus,  Yossi, Dina, Yaakov, and Rimona come under Gabriel’s direction. Dina connects a  series  of seemingly random  terrorist attacks and attributes them to Khaled al-Khalifa,  a mysterious descendant of Palestinian warlords.  Indeed, Dina  points out, Shamron and Gabriel each led operations against Khaled’s relatives.  Though adopted by Yasser Arafat as a   child, Khaled  grew   up abroad and never became a visible force within  the PLO. Dina proposes that, hidden behind a carefully constructed European identity, Khaled has masterminded brutal  attacks against   Israel, including the recent  embassy   bombing. In fact, all of the attacks seem to commemorate the murders of   Palestinians, including  Khaled’s father and  organizer of Black September, Sabri al-Khalifa. Dina suggests that another attack is imminent: she anticipates  an act of  terror to commemorate the Israeli  raising of Beit Sayeed, the hometown  of Khaled’s Palestinian ancestors. Only  twenty-eight  days remain until the fiftieth  anniversary of that event.  The reader  learns that  Khaled lives as a prosperous and renowned French archeologist under the  identity of Paul Martineau. He organizes terror attacks through an Arab associate in Marseilles.  The reader also discovers that the arrangements  for Khaled’s  next attack are underway. As Gabriel and Chiara  settle   into a new life in  Israel, Ari recommends that Gabriel dissolve his marriage to Leah and marry Chiara. He also presses Gabriel to meet with Yasser Arafat to learn of  Khaled’s whereabouts.  Ari’s  son Yonatan, a member of the  IDF,  escorts Gabriel to  the Mukataa, Arafat’s  compound.  Although the Israeli and Palestinian traditionally work for opposing ideologies, Arafat  consents   to the meeting because  Gabriel  once saved his life. Gabriel sees through  Arafat’s evasive answers  and lies and concludes that Khaled did indeed plan the bombing  of the Israeli embassy. Gabriel also learns that   Tariq al-Hourani worked  for Arafat, and the  car bomb that  killed his son and  maimed Leah  was also meant  to end  his own life. Yaakov later introduced  Gabriel to  Mahmoud Arwish, a reticent Palestinian informant.  Arwish confirms that  Khaled contacts  Arafat regularly and uses a female collaborator to relay  important phone messages. Because the most recent  of  such phone messages came from  Cairo, Gabriel  travels to Egypt. There, he meets Mimi Ferrere, a polyglot and social butterfly whose voice  matches that of Khaled’s collaborator. He bugs her  phone,  intercepts a message from Khaled, and  matches the phone number to Marseilles. Aboard the ship  Fidelity, Gabriel meets with his team and Ari Shamron to plan Khaled’s murder. However, Khaled anticipates their attack and  leads Gabriel into a trap: he  must put himself into Khaled’s hands or Leah  will die; Gabriel abandons his team to save his wife. Khaled’s instructions lead Gabriel to the Parisian Gare de Lyon,   and Gabriel realizes too late that Khaled plans to bomb  the train station  and pin  the crime on Gabriel and Israeli intelligence. With only seconds to spare, Gabriel kills  two of Khaled’s three bombers and  rescues Leah. They return safely to Israel, but Khaled  and  Mimi leak photographs of Gabriel to the  press that link him  to the bombing at Gare de Lyon. Although  she still suffers psychiatric trauma, Leah regains a piece of herself and begins to communicate with Gabriel for the  first time in  thirteen  years. Chiara decides  to leave Gabriel and returns to Venice. Ultimately,   Gabriel locates and   kills Khaled at  an  archeological excavation   in southern France. He then   returns to Israel and  art restoration.",
    " The novel begins with  Imriel sitting  down to read the letters that his mother,  Melisande Shahrizai, has written him all these years. After   the occurrences in Kushiel's Scion, especially with Canis  in Lucca, he is now concerned with where  she is and the influence she is trying   to have on  his life. The letters,  while not exactly comforting, tell him much and help  soothe some  of his resentment. Phèdre nó Delaunay, his  foster-mother, asks him if he wants to discuss them  but  he declines.  When he presents himself to the Queen, he tells her his decision to wed the   Alban Princess Dorelei. He  met her when he was eighteen  and  Prince  Talorcan, Drustan's nephew and heir apparent, came to visit\\. While  Drustan would like to name  Alais as his heir, he cannot without risking another  civil war. If Alais were to wed Talorcan, she would rule at his side but their children wouldn't inherit the throne, as Alba  works by matrilineal succession. However, if Imriel were  to wed Dorelei, his son  would become Cruarch and Terre d'Ange's  influence in Alba  would not wane. For this reason,  he is agreeing to  wed her for the  betterment  of  the kingdom. At the same time, however, he has  discovered  that  he  is attracted to his cousin,  Sidonie de la Courcel. He knows that  she feels  the same.  He is still  the son of  two infamous traitors and  she is the dauphine. They cannot  be together. Despite this, during the Midwinter Masque at the palace, Imriel and Sidonie kiss. Only Sidonie's lady-in-waiting,  Amarante, and  Imriel's best  friend,  Mavros, know of their relationship.  They often assist them in being together  and warn them if people are going to burst in and see  them together. Also, Sidonie's private guards know but are extremely loyal to her. Maslin of Lombelon is her chief guard and also rumored to  be her lover. Given the wedding, Imriel begins to take lessons with  Alais on Alban history, law, religion, and linguistic nuances. After  these classes he would meet Sidonie at her quarters and then have a few  hours alone, often to make  love. While Alais does not  approve  of their relationship, predominantly due to  the necessary secrecy, she does nothing to stop them. During one of these lustful afternoons,  Imriel tells Sidonie about what happened to him in Drujan (see Kushiel's Avatar). She listens  calmly but is  greatly saddened.  She then asks whether he would  still be willing to be cruel  with her because she would very much  like  it. For  once Imriel seems to be more comfortable  and willing  to try  this, as long as  it is with her. Their relationship continues as such     for many months while being successfully  hidden from nearly everyone.  Imriel  knows that his wedding  is  approaching though and begins to  get very frustrated.  He and Sidonie know  they can not be  together and believe  that they  only like each other because it is forbidden. To release this frustration,  Mavros takes him to Valerian House once  again.   Given that Imriel  has been drinking, however, Mavros books  them a showing instead.  This proves to be a wonderful  idea and also  helps   Imriel to deal  with his  past and his Kusheline  blood. That summer, Prince Talorcan and Princess Dorelei accompany Drustan  on his  annual trip to  Terre d'Ange in the spring. Dorelei is sweet and kind-hearted, but Imriel is distracted  with his love for Sidonie. He still agrees to wed Dorelei though, because, as Sidonie herself said, they are likely only in love  with  each other because  it is forbidden.  As  well, Sidonie is not  yet eighteen   and   therefore can not cross her mother's will, making any   true relationship with  Imriel impossible. Even still,  Imriel  is sad to be leaving  her. Dorelei,  sensing that he loves  another, says she is  willing to share him, as she knows D'Angelines  do, but that she herself will be only with him, as is Alban custom. Imriel takes this to heart  but assures her there is no one else.  Before the wedding, Imriel and   Sidonie meet  secretly at a Temple of  Elua. There the Priest vows  to keep his silence but discourages the two from being so secretive and continuing a relationship  that will inevitably hurt others. Nevertheless, he provides them with a  private room for their final love-making. Mavros Shahrizai also takes him on a bachelor's party. Imriel is  frustrated, angry, and  rough,  being in  the  perfect mood  for Valerian House.    Mavros, however, makes sure that Imriel does not get carried  away   and is  always safe and sane in his play. The  next morning is the wedding. This is  a public affair  with  all persons of import in attendance. They  are given many gifts,  though  Imriel's most  cherished  gift is that from Drustan's family: vambraces  carved with the image  of the Cullach Gorym, their family  emblem (their diadh-anam). Thus  he is welcomed  into the royal house of Alba. Imriel puts a good  face  on it but inside  he feels nothing but sadness and a hollow  feeling. It  is hot,  he is uncomfortable, and Sidonie is right there the whole  time,  watching him wed  someone else. During the ceremony, Sidonie throws rose petals upon  the couple. Imriel knows the true meaning of this: there is a  passage in the Trois-Mille Joies that says to cover your lover in kisses is  like falling flower petals. Everyone else at  the  wedding  are happy, making Imriel's brooding and  moping all  the  more poignant, though well-hidden.  Dorelei and Imriel  make love that  night, as Dorelei wishes to  have a child, having lit a candle to Eisheth. In the following days,  Imriel confesses to  Dorelei  that he is  in love with someone else, to which she answers  that  she knows, but  understands that theirs is a marriage of politics. Eamonn arrives  at court from Skaldia after  winning the favor  of his Skaldic bride Brigitta's family. Imriel tells to Eamonn  of his relationship with Sidonie. The party bound  for Alba make preparations for their departure when Sidonie returns from  her pilgrimage to Naamah's shrine. She and Imriel  meet  at a temple of  Naamah for a last rendezvous before his departure. The following morning, Imriel departs for Alba with a large D'Angeline escort, Drustan's family, Phèdre nó Delaunay and Joscelin  Verreuil. After the wedding, they travel across Alba to the Prince's new home, Clunderry, with Dorelei's family using the   'open roads' (the taisgaidh), those paths where  no one is allowed  to fight, be attacked or raided, and to where all Albans have access.  On his first night   on  Alban soil, Imriel, missing Sidonie,  fantasizes of her and pleasures himself, spilling  his seed on the soil. During his sleep he is woken  by an irresistible  lustful pull.   He gets up and follows  it. It leads  him to a lone Alban woman,  Morwen,  who seems to have  the ability to  control him and wants him to have a   child with  her. Though he tries to refuse, the spell she has cast on him strong. Suddenly, some of  the Albans from the escort interrupt  them  and the woman flees.  The Albans tell  him he was stupid  indeed. By spreading  his seed, filled with his lust and love, on the common soil, this woman has been  given the  tools  to ensnared  him by making a small mannekin of him, allowing her to call on him  whenever she wishes. They also tell him that the two claw tattoos on  her face means she is of the Maghuin Dhonn. The spell is strong and his only  help is   to go to an  Ollamh, a  religious   druid-like figure. The Ollamh casts a  spell  on him as well and binds each  of his  limbs with  red  ribbon. Imriel must also wear a  croonie-stone around his neck to protect himself. If any   of these are taken off or broken, the spell will be broken and he will  be under  the woman's control again.  Imriel feels relieved  and more clear-headed than he has  been in months. There is a noticeable  change in his mood; while still self-consumed, he  does not seem as sad  as he  was before and is able  to make love to Dorelei. Dorelei, however, loses  her visions of the future, as if a giant grey cloud  were  covering them from her sight. Still, Clunderry is peaceful and typical of an Alban noble's home, filled  with people who are the salt of the  earth. He quickly makes friends with her  guards  and those under his command. Though new, he is  respected by all, but many are still reserved    about this new D'Angeline pretty-boy Prince. He earns  their respect,  however, when he  stages a raid on a neighbouring  lord,  Leodan of Briclaedh.  This lord is challenging him and wants to steal his cattle and  horses,  perceiving  Imriel  to be in a position of weakness.   Imriel  stuns everyone by instead staging a raid on him before Leodan can do the same. Such  raids are done  in fun and  not of any true risk, merely to prove a ruler's mettle. Imriel manages to escape from multiple  attackers with nearly no injuries, earning him praise and respect  from all. This also garners him  a great friendship with Urist, a guard of Clunderry of good renown and well liked  by the troops.  On the ride  back,  Imriel is elated. He finally feels  he is  accepted and respected,  not because of his birth  but because he has  earned it. Then he feels the lustful pull. Without volition, he rides  into a sheltered wooded  area,  where the woman  is waiting.  He tries  to resist as  much as he can, but his body  responds to her  regardless. They are disturbed before anything  more can  happen, and Imriel learns that, during the battle, one of  his red  ties has been cut off. Before even going to  the celebratory feast, he goes to the  local   Ollamh, who recasts the spell. Life continues as it will in an Alban holding, and Dorelei and Imriel manage to have a working relationship, and in some way, love. Dorelei is most certainly in love  with  Imriel, but Imriel  does not seem to feel  anything  strongly. While he  respects her and sees her as  very kind, he  is ultimately wrapped up in his  own personal  emotions and issues,  though he is able to  forget about Sidonie most of the  time. Dorelei  has also become  pregnant and Imriel can  not wait  for  his  child. This  is his real bond  of love with Dorelei, and his wonder  at the life  within  her is  filled with beauty.   Imriel's  cousin, Alais, also grows and matures significantly at Clunderry. She  has been learning the arts of the Ollamh and loves it. Though she does not love Talorcan, she  is  leaving   her doors open and does not refuse  him. Talorcan  is patient. Then one night, a letter arrives. Sidonie writes to him  telling  him that, despite the distance, she is still in love  with him. She tells him  to stay  in Alba, however, for at  least the first year.  Dorelei had promised him that,  if Imriel was not happy after the first year, he could leave  her and move back to Terre d'Ange. They could be as Drustan and Ysandre and  see each other half  the  year, or even less.  While reading this letter, Imriel is  shocked at his lack of emotions. He can  barely even picture Sidonie's face, and all  feelings   for her are  muted beyond comprehension. Thus he decides to take a risk.  He removes the croonie-stone  from around his neck  and reads the letter. He  is filled with sorrow and  love. He  misses her terribly and still loves her  as well. After  a   short while  and reading the letter  a number  of times, he returns the croonie-stone around his neck and returns  to his bed with Dorelei. By spring, Dorelei is very  large from  her  pregnancy,  and she and Imriel are looking forward  to  their first child, who should be  born soon.  While love has grown between to  the two, Imriel  is still distracted by his love for Sidonie, though he is always caring  and loving with Dorelei. A couple days after the  Day of Misrule, however,   Morwen appears out of the  woods right in  front of Clunderry's men. She remains on the taisgaidh roads, but  demands to see Imriel. Imriel meets  her  with all of his guards, the Ollamh, Alais,  and Dorelei  who insisted   on coming along. Morwen says she is willing to make  a deal with Imriel: if he will come with her  to the circle of standing  stones and let her show him   the future, she  will give him his mannekin,  thereby freeing him of her magic. The circle is not far away and is on taisgaidh lands. Imriel does not trust her but she says that if he wants to bring  his troops he may, so long as they stay outside of the  circle.  Imriel  then  asks the advice of the Ollamh. She  does not trust Morwen  as well and asks  that before the ceremony and in the stone circle, Morwen  swear not  to harm Imriel or any of his family. She agrees without  hesitation and with none of the tell-tales of  a lie. Imriel  says he will take the  day to decide   and give her  his decision at  sunset. Morwen agrees and leaves as though  she had melted into the woods themselves. Imriel and Dorelei  discuss  it  that  day  and come to a  decision. Imriel will take  a large escort of the troops to the circle with him and be careful. Dorelei will not risk herself or the child by coming  with him and will stay in Clunderry with the remaining guards. While  it is dangerous, for the  freedom of Imriel, the visions of  Dorelei, and their  unborn   child, it  will be worth it. They also finally decide on the name  of the child:  Aniel if it is a boy and Anielle if it is a girl.  That evening, Dorelei helps  Imriel put on his vambraces and prepare for his meeting  with  Morwen. At the edge of taisgaidh roads, Morwen waits. Upon Imriel's arrival, she leads them to the standing stones. Night has  fallen, and though there are many of Imriel's men carrying torches,  the circle still has an eerie  look about it.  Morwen tells him that he can not wear  any metal within the  circle  and that the lights must be put  out.  He asks why and she only replies that that is how the spell works. To verify his safety, he asks her to make  the pledge with the Ollamh first. Morwen and the Ollamh  go into the circle. Morwen   swears: ::\"No harm will befall Imriel  de la Courcel  of Clunderry this night, nor any member of his  household,  nor any person  dear  to   him. I swear it by the stone and sea and sky, by all the gods of Alba, and  by the diadh-anam of the Maghuin Dhonn. If I lie, let my magic be broken and my life  be forfeit.  Let every man  and woman's hand be  raised against  me, let  my  name be gall on their lips. Let the gods and the diadh-anam forsake me, and let the  land itself despise my footfall. Let my spirit wander for   ten thousand years without solace.\" The Ollamh is satisfied and  departs  for the outside of  the  circle. Morwen leads Imriel into the circle,  after telling him to take  off his shoes. She seemingly lifts one of the  standing  stones and takes out her things from  under it,  letting  it fall back down  behind  her. On the stone  table, she places  her  things and takes  some tea, which she drinks first before giving it to Imriel. He asks her  what it is. She says it is mushroom tea and a gift of the  earth. She then paints her eyelids  and his. Picking up the  stone  knife and a leather bag she passes the bag  to him. He feels the mannekin  inside  it. Morwen then suddenly cuts  his bindings and all his love, emotions, and reality   comes flooding back. Morwen then cuts her wrists and holds his hands. Waiting, the tea starts to have an effect. Eventually  he begins to see that the stones are telling him a story. He sees a boy who is obviously his unborn son,  Aniel. He sees Dorelei  dead with Aniel holding on to him. He sees his son with Alais and then, as  a  teen, yelling at   Urist. Then there is  a pause.  Morwen  says this is because he has left Alban shores.  He returns, however, and Imriel can see the  glitter of intelligence in  his eyes and   glee at the causing of arguments.  These arguments   lead to wars between the tribes of  Alba and the death  of Talorcan. He is then named Cruarch and  brings hundreds of D'Angeline  soldiers to Alba, crushing all resistance. He sees women and children taken out of   their  homes  and their homes  being  torched. He sees Aniel kill a wounded man   begging for mercy. Aniel burns the sacred groves and drags away the standing stones. He is a  fearless and cruel leader who  hunts down the  Maghuin  Dhonn until all  are  gone, and redesigns Bryn Gorrydum into  a  D'Angeline city. Finally, Imriel begs her to stop and  she does, letting go of his  hands. \"Your son is a monster, Imriel,\"  she says. Imriel asks why this is. She replies that she does not know, and at first the visions were of many  possibilities. Dorelei would die  before her second  child is  born and Imriel leaves Alban shores. At first  there was Imriel and Morwen's daughter to   balance  Aniel, but   now all  that remained   was  this one vision.  Imriel  asks if she  considered that  her intervention caused this in  the  first place, and whether she considered not getting  involved. With deep sorrow, she  said she had considered it. Imriel hears  horns and sees  the flaws in Morwen. Realizing the cuts were deeper  than he though he learns  an awful secret.  Morwen has lied, harm is coming  to  Imriel's family. Her life  is sacrificed for  the  good of the Maghuin Dhonn. He rushes back to Clunderry,  still  under the effects of  the mushroom tea.  All is  in a daze  and blurry.   The gates of the   castle  are open; Leodan of Briclaedh staged his  counter cattle-raid on this night after hearing that the  troops would  be elsewhere. A giant bear is now trying to enter the castle. Imriel charges him,  but is swiped by a giant  claw and falls unconscious. When he wakes, he sees Dorelei lying on a table nearby, clearly dead.  Imriel falls into a  deep depression. He has been severely  clawed by the bear,  the Maghuin Dhonn shape-shifter leader Berlik. He is transported to Bryn Gorrydum and being  treated by an Eisandine healer.  Alais would keep him company most days, but vengeance was what kept  him   alive; he  wanted  Berlik's  death. The  hunt for Berlik in Alba was unsuccessful, but  Hyacinthe, the  Master of the Straits, saw a large bear swim to  Azzalle, across the straits.  While  he could  not be sure  it was  Berlik, Imriel was. Imriel swears he will bring back Berlik's head and bury it as Dorelei's feet, a  traditional custom of  Alba. Urist promises to help him, as do a number of Clunderry's men. When Imriel is finally deemed  to be well  enough to ride, he tells Drustan of the arrangements, says goodbye to Alais, and  departs for  Terre d'Ange. In Azzalle,  Urist and Imriel destroy the mannekin and cut his  bindings. Imriel  tells him who it was he loved all this time and, while shocked, Urist still dedicates  himself to   Imriel's service: \"So you were good enough for the  Cullach Gorrym, good enough to marry Dorelei mab Beidaia, good  enough to beget  Alba  a successor, but not good enough for the Queen's  daughter?\" They all ride for the  City of Elua, dedicated to true love and the hunt  for Berlik.  Upon  arriving  at the Palace, Imriel immediately goes to Sidonie's quarters,  sinks  to his knees before her  and wraps his arms around her waist.  Ysandre  walks in on the scene and is furious. Imriel walks out from the Palace, but not  before Sidonie kisses him before   the all those watching. Mavros offers the Shahrizai  hunting estates outside  of the City for   Imriel and the Albans to stay out  of the   turmoil of the City. Sidonie comes to see him.  After lovemaking, a royal escort led  by Lord Amaury Trente  come to  take her back  home. She  refuses, saying she is a grown  woman now  over  the age of  majority, and that she will love  who she  loves freely. Imriel  learns that  Phèdre and Joscelin still are not  back from their mysterious journey, but he visits the  house  and has a pleasant  visit with all. Upon  gathering  all the supplies and funding he  needs, including from the royal coffers despite Ysandre's opinion of  his affair with her daughter, he  and the Albans depart for  the north. Their journey takes   them through the Flatlands toward the  new kingdom of Vralia. Imriel  and Urist  then book passage by boat  to the capital of Vralia, following Berlik's trail. After being lost on an island for at least a month, they both make it to the capital Vralgrad. Urist is too  injured to continue,  however, and stays in  Vralgrad. Imriel continues to follow rumours of Berlik south to the small town of Tarkov. Imriel has the unfortunate bad timing, however, to be in Tarkov for a Tartar  raid. Seeing the scars  on his   behind left from Daršanga, the people think that  he is  a  secret spy of  the Tartars and put  him in jail.  He is stuck  there  for a long time  with  one other Tartar prisoner.  He  manages to  escape through  cunning, and helps free his Tartar  companion  so that he may be  able  to go back to the woman he loves. From there Imriel  follows   the long-stale path  of  Berlik, or what he thinks is Berlik's path.  He stops  at a small  Yeshuite Temple in Miroslas,  the last reaches  of civilization,  and learns that Berlik stayed there  for a time, seeking forgiveness. They try  to discourage  him   from hunting down Berlik, but Imriel departs, still dedicated to his   quest.  He spends many days and nights wandering  the untamed forests in search of Berlik. He goes  nearly mad with the silence, loneliness, and seemingly hopelessness of his mission. He is forced to send back his horse, hoping it will make it alive to  a  warm stable,  for lack of sufficient food and fodder. Just before deciding that he must turn back before  he starves, Berlik leaves him a  sign.  Following this  trail he  comes upon a  small cabin that Berlik has built and obviously still lives  in. There  is  a makeshift cross in his cabin and a fire still  burning.  Here, finally, Berlik appears.  He is humbled  and broken and asks    only for his death, for   only his death at  the hands of Imriel can    bring him atonement. Berlik tells him, \"I  prayed...I  left a trail for you to follow, and  I prayed that if you  found me, the diadh-anam would accept  my sacrifice as atonement, and not punish all  of her people for my failure. When my magic returned to me, here in the woods, I  knew it was  so.\"  Imriel  asks why Berlik made  it so hard for him. He   replies, \"Would you have come here with  a humble heart if I had not?\" Berlik admits  his  mistakes, his  fears, and admits that he should have trusted his gods  more  instead  of only himself. He apologizes to Imriel  and  calls him  \"my avenging angel.\" As Imriel raises his sword, he knows the true meaning  that Kushiel, the punisher of god, loved his charges too well. Imriel says,  \"I'm sorry,\" cuts off Berlik's head cleanly,  and  weeps. After a day in Berlik's cabin,  gathering more food and supplies, he departs back for  his  far-away home. After days of trudging,  he is shocked to hear voices arguing in Rus  and D'Angeline! They  are not rescuers, however: they  are soldiers  from Tarkov,  come to capture him. The D'Angeline they are arguing  with is Maslin  of Lombelon, sent  by Sidonie to find Imriel. Maslin and Imriel  manage to  fight off the  guards and make a  truce  of their once jealousy of  each   other.  Maslin, it  seems, has grown much in his travels as  well. During their trek  through the forests,  Maslin ends up boiling Berlik's head for Imriel, in a sort of penance. It is disgusting work,  but Maslin refuses to let  Imriel do it. They then continue on their travels.  They travel together back to Tarkov. They  try to disguise Imriel but  Tarkov is the closest port for ferries headed to the city  and eventually home. When  they arrive   in  Tarkov,  however, they  find Phèdre and Joscelin, come  to search for Imriel  and join him on his long  trek. Phèdre is  arguing with the guards, trying to explain   he is a royal Prince of Terre d'Ange and  not a Tartar.  While they do not believe her, none want to challenge them and grudgingly  \"allow\" them to   leave. In the  capital, Joscelin meets  his once pupil and now leader of the Yeshuites and  most trusted advisor of King Vral, Micah ben Ximon. As the weather improves,  they take a boat back to the Flatlands and travel to Azzalle.  Maslin  chooses to stay in Vralia as a  representative of Terre d'Ange,  and because he has fallen in love with  a  local woman. Once they are back in   Terre d'Ange, all are happy to report their arrival. (this material is obtained from the preview at the end of the paper-back  edition of Kushiel's  Justice) Imriel hurries  back  to Sidonie's side. The Queen has calmed down considerably but cannot countenance the relationship  because  of Imriel's parents.  She cannot denounce  it, however,  because to do so would be to go against Elua's Precept. He,  Sidonie, Phèdre, Joscelin, and  his Alban escort  return to Clunderry to bury Berlik's head,  fulfilling Imriel's promise. On their   return to the City of Elua,  they  are greeted by a large group of people with black   armbands, the victims of Melisande and Benedicte's machinations, showing a thumbs-down (see Kushiel's Mercy).",
    " The play  is set in a vaguely  described  science fiction   future dominated by \"The Game,\" a conflation of rock music and violence played by \"Markers\"  under the direction of \"The Keepers.\"  Hoss  has  struggled to become the top Marker,  only to find himself doubting his own  abilities in the face of opposition from \"Gypsies\" who operate  outside of   the official rules. Act 1: Eager to make an outing, Hoss  is frustrated when  the Star-Man advises him   against  it on the  basis of his astrology. Hoss learns that his rival, Mojo  Root Force, has encroached upon his territory in Las Vegas in a move of  questionable   legality. After getting word that a Gypsy  from Vegas is on his way to attack him, Hoss calls an old friend, Little  Willard, for backup,  only  to  find  that Willard  has committed suicide due to  his inability to cope with his status. These successive revelations  exacerbate Hoss's self-doubt and his belief  that the old way is dying, and he attempts to perk up his confidence   by challenging the Gypsy to a shiv fight. Act II: Before the duel  (which has been  changed from a shiv fight  to battle of  words   under  the guidance of  an official referee) Hoss and Crow  attempt to psych each  other out. While Crow learns to  imitate Hoss's walk and style,   Hoss  intimidates Crow by taking on the voice of an old Western gunslinger. Despite an ostensibly effective second round in  which he takes on the voice of a Delta bluesman, Hoss loses the battle when  Crow exposes Hoss's \"Fear  that he's crackin' busted in  two.\" After killing the Ref, a   desperate  Hoss begs Crow to teach him the  new style. Ultimately, however, he decides to commit his last authentic act by killing  himself,  for which Crow  commends him. The  play ends with Crow assuming his place on Hoss' throne, with Becky quickly shifting her  loyalty.",
    "  The Emersons are  at home in England, aching to return to Egypt, but  finding no excuse to return  until Lady Baskerville asks them to finish the excavation  started by her husband, who  died mysteriously just before opening a tomb in  Luxor.

    " It  comes to pass that  the stranger reveals himself to be Bevan of Eubaricon, the son of an ancient High King of Isle and Celwony, the goddess  of the moon.  His appearance  offers both hope and threat to Cuin and Ellid,  and the mortals they represent. The lands would benefit from a High King who would keep the regional lordlings from  warring  with   each other, but at the same time, Bevan’s presence stirs Pel, an ancient evil who  begins preying  upon the mortals to raise an army of undead  using the Coradel Orre. Ellid falls in love with Bevan and turns away from her engagement  to  Cuin.  Cuin, in turn, finds himself apprenticed to Bevan after Bevan saves him from the Priests of Pel. Bevan decides  it is his destiny to return  the Coradel Orre   to   the Gods, so they can  refresh their  immortality and  goes in search  of it. On  their quest,  Cuin  discovers he is  heir to an ancient kingdom older  than Pryce Dacaerin’s  holdings. To  complete their quest, Cuin  must first win a   magical sword from those who guard the kingdom, and then Bevan, Cuin, and Dacaerin  work together  to gather the  lords of Isle together to wage war  on Pel and his undead army. Bevan and Cuin together win a  great victory, but lose  the Coradel Orre,  marking the end of immortal gods in the world of men. Bevan is crowned High King and  marries Ellid. Cuin  is absent from the ceremony on a diplomatic journey,  but his  escort betrays and nearly  kills  him.   Bevan rides to his rescue before  the marriage is complete, and in the process  triggers a prophecy which makes him unwilling to  continue to dwell in the world of men any  longer.  Ellid and Cuin accompany Bevan  as he makes  his   preparations to leave Isle  and they discover they have loved each  other all   along.

    " Frisk is narrated by Dennis, who had   a troubled childhood. In 1969, aged 13, he was  regularly  allowed to read pornographic magazines  and was particularly affected by snuff pornography,  even though he later learns  that the pictures were faked.

    " Max is an eight-year-old boy whose family has  just  moved into an  old farmhouse in  Yorkshire. He discovers some old toy  soldiers in the attic and is surprised and delighted to find that they come  to life. The soldiers, known as the Twelves, or  the Young Men, have different personalities; they are brave, intelligent and very independent, not to mention argumentative.  They adopt   Max as one  of their Genii, or protective spirits, and he begins to spend most of his time watching and thinking about them. He   learns from the local  parson that they once belonged to the Brontës, who wrote stories about   their adventures.

    " The  story is narrated by a  ten-year-old boy living on Earth after it has been torn away from the Sun by a passing \"dark star\". The loss of solar  heating has caused the Earth's atmosphere to freeze  into thick layers of \"snow\". The boy's father had worked with  a  group  of other scientists to construct a  large shelter, but the earthquakes accompanying the disaster  had destroyed it  and  killed the others. He  managed  to construct  a  smaller,  makeshift shelter called  the \"Nest\" for his family, where they maintain a breathable atmosphere by  periodically retrieving pails of frozen oxygen to thaw over a  fire. They have survived  in this way for a  number  of  years. At the end, they are found by a search party  from a  large group of survivors at Los Alamos,  where they are using nuclear power to  provide heat  and have begun using  rockets to search for other survivors (radio being  ineffective  at  long range without an ionosphere).

    " The  animals' owners, the Hunters, leave  go  to England for several months because Jim, the father, is scheduled to give a series  of university lectures there. They leave their pets in the care of John Longridge, a family  friend  and godfather of their daughter, Elizabeth. One  day, after John  Longridge leaves for a two week duck hunting trip, the animals, feeling the lack of their human companions, set out to   try to find their owners, the  Hunters. Mrs. Oakes, who is  taking care of Longridge's home, doesn't find the animals and thinks  that John must have taken them with him.  The animals follow  their  instincts and  move forward toward home,  nearly  300 miles ways. *  Luath:  Luath is a young Labrador. His fur is red-gold, his eyes are brown, and he is of strong build.  Luath is a  loyal and brave companion and the natural leader of the group. Of the three pets, he is the most recent  addition. He is also the  most determined to push forward and reach home  and  the Hunters. Luath usually walks  on Bodger's left side to  guide him since the older dog is almost  blind in his left  eye. He is arguably the  one who suffers  the  most  from  lack of food   because  after a porcupine  hits him in the face with its quills, the wounds  become infected,  making it difficult for him  to open his mouth.  * Bodger: Bodger (whose   full name is Ch. Boroughcastle Brigadier of Doune) is an old   English  bull terrier.  His  fur is white with a  slight pinkish tint. Bodger's left eye is nearly blind. The dog was born  to fight and endure (as he does in the book).  Because  he is  eleven years old, Bodger tires easily;  but he is a  brave, loyal, persevering  and tenacious companion. He is  very fond of humans, particularly children, and   whenever the group comes across humans  in  their  travels, he tries  to charm them for affection and snacks, with varying results. He has  an intense  hostility towards all cats save   Tao, who earned his respect by standing  up to  him when he first joined the  Hunter family as  a small kitten. Though they care deeply for Luath, Bodger and Tao have a  special bond. Bodger is the  first of the animals to have joined  the  Hunter family. Despite his advanced age  and diminished  senses,  Bodger is still  every   bit  the fighter he was  in his prime, at one point saving Luath from a Border Collie sicced on them by an irate  farmer. * Tao: Tao is a  slender,  seal-pont,  old  style Siamese cat with  sapphire eyes.  An element of humor in the book is that Tao, like  Bodger, despises other cats, and the two once  shared many adventures terrorizing  the other  felines in their neighborhood; when they  encounter other domesticated cats  in their travels, Tao often fights them, successfully. Tao is able to  open most doors, a help to the dogs in several situations.  Tao is a  tireless,  bold,   and loyal animal. Tao is probably the best  equipped  of  the  three to survive in the wilderness, and  has no difficulty surviving on his  own when  separated from the two dogs; despite this, he spends all his time seeking  to rejoin them, a testament to the bond between the animals. The cat is an independent and natural hunter,  catching small birds for the group. When Tao is separated from  them, the dogs fare  more  poorly without Tao  than Tao does without them.  Therefore, Tao  is crucial  to  the dogs' survival. * John Longridge: John  Longridge is Elizabeth Hunter's godfather.  He lives in a stone house in  a small  village about 300 miles from  the  college town where  the Hunters live. Mr.  Longridge wrote several historical books, is a writer by profession, and a bachelor. * The Hunter Family: The Hunter Family consists of the father Jim,  the mother and  their two  children, 11 year old  Peter and 9 year old Elizabeth. Jim owns Luath, Elizabeth owns Tao, and Peter owns Bodger. * Mrs. Oakes: Mrs. Oakes   is the caretaker  of the three animals while John is gone on his trip. Her husband  is Bert. * The Nurmi Family: The  Nurmi family are a family of Finnish immigrants. 10 year old Helvi takes a liking to Tao after she discovers   him unconscious in the water while walking home  from school. * The  Mackenzies: James and  his wife, Nell,  are an older couple who live  alone, now that  their eight children have grown   up.  They find Bodger  and Luath, and provide them with a  place to stay.",
    " The novel  is prefaced by  a section entitled \"Questions\", which consists of four passages numbered in Roman numerals. I  Chandra Chagoo  is  threatened  by  Abdul Khan, who believes Chagoo has been  asking questions in order to gather evidence  for the police.  II Dr  Gauri Subbiah contemplates confronting Chagoo and demanding exactly what  he  knows about her past. She fears  he  knows everything. III Dr  Ram Mahipal lectures a class of medical students about the importance of  asking questions. Privately he contemplates imminent professional  ruin for asking the wrong  question.  IV Professor Phaterpaker also contemplates  professional ruin as a result of Ram Mahipal's question, the answer to which Chagoo  already knows. The   preface ends. The main body of the novel  begins with the heading: Answer The Commissioner tells Ghote that a criminal named Abdul Khan has supplied Bombay film stars with drugs from the Mira Behn Institute. Ghote is ordered to find  who stole drugs from  the  institute and  arrest them under a false charge to prevent a scandal. Ghote tells the Commissioner that  he recently caught an airline stewardess, Nicky D'Costa, smuggling drugs for Abdul Khan. The Commissioner says he will assign another officer to   manage Nicky D'Costa as an  informant  and that it  will take  a  better officer than   Ghote to bring Abdul Khan to justice. Ghote questions Asha Rani, a  movie   star. Her \"friend\" Mr Ganguly took a sample of  a medicine called A.C.E. and nearly died. Khan, who  also  supplied Mr Ganguly with cocaine, supplied the A.C.E.  At the institute, Ghote interviews Professor Phaterpaker. The Professor says he will go to any lengths  to  protect the  institute. The institution's work is largely concerned with  making new medicines from  the venom of poisonous snakes. Dr Subbiah immediately   suspects  Chandra Chagoo of having stolen the  A.C.E. and leads Ghote  to the reptile room. When the door  is unlocked they find Chagoo dead  with  a Russell's viper loose  in the room. The next day the Commissioner  assigns Ghote to investigate  Chagoo's death to prevent the scandal being exposed by another  officer. Ghote realises that Chagoo did not have a  key to lock the reptile room  door and must have been murdered. Ghote interviews Dr Ram Mahipal, who left a reptile-room key in  his old office  at  the  institute when  he  suddenly quit his  job. Ghote  learns from the building manager that  Mahipal returned in order  to  access his computer  files on the night  Chagoo  died. Dr Subbiah, Professor  Phaterpaker, Dr Mahipal and the building manager were all  in the building at the time. Ghote suspects that the murder may be an  employee at the nearby hospital. He enlists  the  inspector originally assigned to  Chagoo's   death to    test this   theory. On their next meeting Mahipal says he returned to teaching in hopes of instilling integrity in young medical  students. Mahipal left the  institute because  he believed  that Phaterpaker faked results, possibly on a regular basis.  Phaterpaker takes the news that Chagoo was   murdered  calmly, remarking  that Mahipal  was  slipshod and implying  that he was  dismissed  for  this.  Ghote tries to determine exactly why Mahipal left, but Phaterpaker is vague.  When Phaterpaker realises  he himself is a suspect, he is affronted but  admits \"cutting  corners\"  and acts like a man with something to hide. Ghote concludes  that Phaterpaker is trying to use Mahipal as a scapegoat to protect the institute. Dr  Subbiah reacts badly when asked about her relations with Chagoo, however Ghote  concludes she is not the  killer. Ghote discovers that Dr Mahipal's father works as a cook at the medical school  and  is a Brahmin, whereas Mahipal claims  to be a  member of the Dalit caste. Ghote deduces  that  Mahipal misrepresented himself in order to get a university scholarship reserved for the lower classes. Mahipal  confesses this    is so. Ghote suggests Chagoo came to learn Mahipal's secret and was murdered because of this. Mahipal denies this and reveals that he left  the  institute because  Phaterpaker  was removing lab animals that gave  undesirable results. At the police  station, Ghote is dismayed  when the   inspector he is working with points  out one of the three scientists must  surely hang for the crime and expresses a preference that it be Dr Subbiah. At the institute Ghote accuses Phaterpaker of falsifying test  results. Phaterpaker   confesses  his results  are fake. He became  aware that Chagoo was  stealing drugs  from the  institute but was forced to agree to  a truce  because Chagoo knew  Phaterpaker was removing lab animals. Ghote considers  the reptile room  and realises wooden stool  must  have been used to break the glass,  so he decides to have it dusted for fingerprints. At the police station Ghote learns that Nicky D'Costa has murdered, her throat slit after asking too  many questions  of Abdul Khan. Ghote is angry enough to confront  the commissioner, but learns Khan had arranged to be in hospital during the murder. The forensic tests do not  find a match between any fingerprints on  the  stool and Ghote's three suspects. Nor can they prove it was used to break the glass of the  viper's cage. Ghote goes home and  argues with his wife, then inspiration strikes and he returns to  the institute.  There he searches the grounds for  evidence someone could gain access by  night. The security guard catches Ghote and he must call his  fellow inspector  to  rescue him. Afterwards Ghote chances upon Dr Subbiah. Ghote deduces that Phaterpaker persuaded her to \"anticipate\" the results of her experiments,  as Phaterpaker  himself  was  once persuaded. The conversation between Ghote and Subbiah  is  interrupted when, by  chance, they pass  the funeral of  Nicky D'Costa. Ghote tells Subbiah  how Nicky D'Costa was  murdered  and  proceeds to question her about  her test results. Subbiah remarks that Abdul Khan was a patient at  the teaching  hospital  recently. Ghote asks whether she anticipated her    results before  completing the actual  experiment. She admits faking  her  results. Ghote now believes  that Subbiah is the  murderer. He accuses her and she reacts  in  amazement, saying that Chagoo was clearly strangled.  Ghote realises that   he only saw the  body  laying face down, and the inspector  originally  assigned  to the case never forwarded the medical  examiner's report. Ghote realises that Chagoo could not have been strangled by Subbiah or Phaterpaker because neither of them have the  necessary strength. Dr Mahipal has  a  withered arm,  eliminating him as a suspect.  Returning  to the police station, Ghote talks to the forensic expert who examined the stool  from the institute reptile room. The  expert admits he only compared the fingerprints  on the  stool to  the  three suspects Ghote  named; Subbiah, Phaterpaker and Mahipal. Without Khan's file in front of him, he could  not identify the fingerprints. Khan's file  is retrieved and his fingerprints are a  perfect  match. Ghote  realises he can arrest and charge Khan with murder and  recalls, with satisfaction,  the words used by Commissioner's at the start of the case:  \"Frankly, Inspector, it  will take   a better man than you to put paid to Abdul  Khan\".",
    " Soraya, Kavi and Jiaan have agreed to work together  to defeat the Hrum and free Farsala. However, distrust of  Kavi is impeding this effort. The three attempt to work together, but it becomes difficult. Luckily, they have finally uncovered the secret  of watersteel,  with the help of Kavi's ability   to  \"speak\" to  metal. Only a few   months  remain   in  the Hrums self-imposed limit to conquer Farsala. The three youths learn that Garren, the Strategus in charge of the conquest, has more   riding on the conquest than just Farsala. His  father,  a member  of the Senate of  the  Hrum Empire,  stated that Garren would conquer Farsala with only ten  thousand troops. In   addition, his father stated that he will  resign from the Senate if  this is not accomplished. He  did these things in  order to  secure the assignment of the Farsalan conquest to his son. Garren's  father's enemies are eager  for this to  happen. When Garren requisitions gold to hire Kadeshi aid  and circumvent the  troop  sanction, the Senate sends a delegation to  review the conquest.  Kavi, Jiaan and Soraya  decide to capture the gold before it reaches the Kadeshi, as a  Kadeshi warlord has informed Jiaan that if he chooses to pay, the warlord will order  the troops he sent Garren to betray the Hrum, crippling  the army. Jiaan,  Kavi and Soraya do  not wish for this to happen. Soraya, with Kavi  accompanying her, visits the bandits and convinces them to rob the  Senate  committee, which will  arrive  at  the  nearby harbor of Dugaz.  They believe that if the delegation is robbed during its stay, it will  demonstrate to the  Senate that Garren does not   have the country under  control.  However, upon arriving at the bandits' lair, Shir, their leader, informs Kavi and Soraya that the Senate arrived a week ago, and the bandits failed to  rob  them. Disappointed, the two promise Shir that   in  exchange for  letting them go,  they  will get the Suud  to try to develop a cure for  the swamp  fever plaguing   the bandits. The gold arrives in Setesafon, and under Garren's close supervision. Using stolen Hrum disguises, Kavi infiltrates the palace, attempting to  uncover the  passwords into the vault, but is captured.  Before  he is  captured  he burns  the words into his  mule's saddle, which  Jiaan and Soraya  find. Jiaan and Soraya  enter the  palace  under a  guise that Jiaan has  captured Soraya. They release the gold into barrels in the river. After the gold is discovered  missing Garren orders Kavi tortured, but Kavi withstands it. Garren  publicly  declares that if Sorahb  does not fight Garren as a champion of Farsala,   Kavi will be slain. While Jiaan believes the challenge  to be  a trap and  does  not think Kavi will be killed, Fasal accepts the challenge. After Fasal breaks  Garren's blade with the newly-developed Farsalan watersteel, Garren orders Fasal  killed. The Farsalans begin rioting and  Soraya, outraged, uses magic  to kill Garren with lightning. The  senate committee is convinced Farsala is not subdued, and decides the Hrum shall  leave Farsala as an allied  state.  The remaining people  send delegates, and Kavi, much to  his annoyance, is  elected to be a \"councilherd\"  of the council; to make things run smoothly. Jiaan is invited to accompany the Hrum on their next  campaign, that  in Kadesh; he accepts. Soraya decides  to live with the Suud.",

    " The  disappearance of Dr. Larry Pettifer from  his teaching position  at Bath University  shouldn't  have concerned  a  great many people, especially a retired Treasury  boffin like Tim Cranmer. But  when Detective Inspector Bryant and Sergeant Luck of  the Bath Police call upon Cranmer at his Somerset   manor house and vineyard   late on a Sunday evening,  Cranmer finds himself facing   repercussions from his secret and not-too-distant  past. Pettifer, the reader eventually  learns, was a British  Secret Intelligence Service operative during the Cold War and Cranmer was his handler for some twenty years. The Cold  War is over, the Berlin Wall has come  down  and  SIS has put  Cranmer and his agent  Pettifer out   to pasture.  Pettifer turns to teaching  at Bath University  and Cranmer is content to settle  at Honeybrook, his inherited estate in  Somerset, growing wine and making  love to his beautiful young mistress Emma. Not content with staying cloistered in Bath, Larry begins  paying visits to Honeybrook and  soon becomes a permanent fixture in their lives. At    least, that is, until both  Larry and Emma disappear. Panicked by  his     encounter  with the Bath Police, Cranmer contacts  his   former employers and is summoned  to London where he  learns that, not  only has  Larry disappeared, he's absconded with some ₤37  million milked from the Russian Government with the help of a former Soviet spy. Cranmer finds himself suspected as Larry's accomplice by the Bath Police—and, later, by \"The Office,\"  or SIS—and decides to track down his protégé and his former mistress.  But  why would a quixotic intellectual like Larry, a  man who had no interest in money, suddenly wish to steal ₤37 million from  the Russians?  To solve this mystery, Cranmer begins calling on old contacts from Oxford  to the arms trade to find out what his  former agent and  his purloined  mistress have been up to in their disappearance. He also visits his secret archive   of Office files, stashed away  in the abandoned  church of St. James the  Less, bequeathed to him by the same Uncle Bob who left him Honeybrook.  As he peruses his cache of documents, he begins  to uncover the plot between Larry and  Konstantin Checheyev, the former Soviet  handler  of Larry (the latter one pretended to  work for Soviets during the Cold War). Checheyev, it seems,  is not  Russian but Ingush, a native of the high  Caucasus and begrudged of the Russians  who have displaced him and his people from their rightful homes. The Ingush are primed for  an uprising against their  Russian oppressors and Larry's   the man to arm  them. Cranmer begins his journey, first to  an  arms dealer in Macclesfield, England, whom  he finds murdered  along with his assistants by an Ossetian group called \"The Forest;\" then to find Emma,  who has sought shelter in Paris; then to Russia to  track down his former Soviet contacts in hopes  of finding Larry;  then to  Ingushetia to  find his  friend and try   to save him  - from  the Russians, the Ossetians and from himself.",
    " The novel   follows the exploits of  Detroit process server Jack Ryan, who  has a  reputation for finding men  who don't want to be found. A string of  seemingly unrelated crimes leads Ryan to the search for  a missing stockholder known only as \"unknown man #89,\" but his missing man  isn't \"unknown\" to everyone: a pretty blonde hates his guts, and a very nasty dude named Virgil Royal wants  him  dead in the worst  way. This  is very unfortunate  for Jack, who is suddenly caught in  the crossfire of a lethal triple-cross and   becomes as much a target  as his nameless  prey. Along the way, Ryan butts heads  with local police, including six-shooter-carrying Dick Speed. The book is perhaps  best remembered for a sequence taken straight from   The Godfather, where  thug Virgil plants a shotgun in  the meeting  place of his victim, in  this case,  the fire escape of  Bobby Lear's  hotel room. Also  of note is homosexual wannabe gangster Lonnie, whose  \"superfly\"  haircut was  emulated by several of Elmore Leonard's other characters.",
    " The story  concerns mischievous mythical  creatures, the  Gremlins of the title, often invoked  by Royal Air Force pilots  as an  explanation of mechanical troubles and  mishaps. In Dahl's  book, the gremlins' motivation for sabotaging British  aircraft is revenge of the destruction of their forest  home, which  was razed to make way  for an aircraft factory.  The principal character in the book, Gus, has his Hawker Hurricane fighter destroyed  over the  English   Channel by a  gremlin, but  is able  to convince the gremlins  as they parachute  into the water that they should join forces against a common enemy, Hitler  and the Nazis, rather than fight each other. Eventually, the gremlins are re-trained  by the  Royal Air  Force to repair rather than sabotage  aircraft, and restore Gus   to active  flight status  after a particularly severe crash.The  book had an autobiographical  connection as Dahl had flown as a Hurricane  fighter pilot  in the RAF, and was temporarily on leave from operational flying  after serious  injuries sustained in a  crash  landing in Libya. He later returned to flying. The book  also contains picturesque details about the  ordinary lives of gremlins: baby gremlins, for instance, are known as widgets, and females as fifinellas, a name taken from the great \"flying\" filly racehorse  Fifinella, that won both the  Epsom Derby and Epsom Oaks  in 1916,  the year Dahl was born.",
    " Vera is a barmaid  in her  father's tavern,  which is situated along a road to  the prison camps in Siberia. A gang  of prisoners stop at the tavern. Vera immediately recognises her brother Dmitri as one of the prisoners. He begs her to go to  Moscow and join the   Nihilists, a terrorism group trying to assassinate the Czar, and avenge  his imprisonment.   She and her father's  manservant Michael leave to join the Nihilists. Years later, Vera has become the Nihilists' top assassin, and is wanted across Europe. She is in  love with a fellow Nihilist named Alexis: however, Nihilists are sworn never to marry. A Nihilist meeting is nearly   broken up  by  soldiers,  but Alexis thwarts the  soldiers by revealing his true identity: he is the Tsarevich, heir to the Russian throne. This act  earns  him the  further  admiration of Vera and the hatred of  the  Nihilists. At a council meeting,  Tsar  Ivan and his cruel  epigrammatic minister Prince Paul Maraloffski criticise Tsarovitch Alexis's democratic leanings, but the Tsar  is   assassinated  by Michael after  the Tsarovitch opened the window. Alexis ascends the throne and exiles Prince  Paul Maraloffski, not to Siberia, but  to  Paris. Maraloffski joins the  Nihilists to kill  Alexis. The task  of assassinating the   Tsar is given  to Vera. She must infiltrate the palace, stab  the Tsar and throw  the dagger out the window as a signal to Nihilist agents below. If she  does not, the agents will break in and kill him. Vera is reluctant to kill the man  she loves, though. Alexis returns  to the palace after his coronation, intending to end injustice in Russia during his reign.    Vera  enters the  palace,   knife at the ready. Alexis asks her to  marry him. She accepts, but then  she hears the agents  outside crying  out for the signal.  She stabs herself and throws the dagger out the window,   and the  agent  departs satisfied. :Alexis: Vera, what have  you done? :Vera: I have saved  Russia. [dies]",
    "  Copying his father's approach of focusing on the  most important officers of the two armies (General Robert E. Lee, Major  General Winfield Scott Hancock,   Lt.  Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\"  Jackson, and Lieutenant Colonel  Joshua  Chamberlain), Shaara depicted  the emotional drama of soldiers fighting old friends while accurately  detailing historical details including troop movements,  strategies, and tactical combat situations. General Hancock,  for  instance, spends much  of the  novel dreading the day he will have to fire on his friend  in  the Confederate Army,  Lewis \"Lo\" Armistead. The novel also  deals  with  General Lee's disillusionment with the Confederate bureaucracy  and General Jackson's  religious fervor. In addition to covering events leading up to the war, the book details the events  of First Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville.  The film version provides only cursory coverage of immediate  pre-war events, focusing primarily on Lee and the secession of Virginia, and omits the Battle of  Antietam.  ",

One night of  their emigration  journey, whilst camping on a riverbank, José Arcadio Buendía dreams  of \"Macondo\", a city  of mirrors  that  reflected  the world in and about it.  Upon awakening, he decides to found Macondo at the  river  side; after days of wandering the jungle, José Arcadio Buendía's founding of Macondo is utopic. Founding  patriarch José Arcadio Buendía believes  Macondo to be surrounded by water, and from that  island, he invents the world   according to his perceptions. Soon after its foundation, Macondo becomes a town frequented  by unusual and extraordinary  events that involve the  generations  of the Buendía family, who are unable  or unwilling to escape  their periodic (mostly) self-inflicted misfortunes.

In Tomb of Horrors,  the  adventurers encounter a number of tricks and traps  while attempting to penetrate the tomb of a dead  wizard.  As the scenario begins, the players are  told that the evil wizard Acererak is said to linger in his ancient tomb in undead form. Originally a powerful lich, he has (unbeknownst to   the players) become a  demi-lich, a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the   need for any  physical body apart from  its   skull.

    " Near to  the  Wild Heart  does not  have a  conventional narrative plot. It  instead   recounts  flashes from the life of  Joana, between  her present, as a young woman, and her early childhood. These focus, like most  of Lispector's works, on interior, emotional states. The book opens with a scene of  the  child Joana playing  in the garden, making  up poems for her  father. Joana's wildness and barely suppressed violence,  along with  her linguistic creativity, are her most notable features. She is  frequently compared  to animals:  over  the    course of the book Lispector describes her  to a  bird, a snake, a wildcat, a horse, and a  dog. She commits transgressive acts—as a  child she throws  a book at an old man's head, for example, and as  a married woman  she leaves her husband, Otávio, and greets the  news of  his  adultery—he has made another woman, his old friend  Lídia, pregnant—with utter indifference. She is not so much immoral as she is amoral: “Evil is  not living, and that’s it. Dying is already something else. Dying is different from good and  evil.” In the book, she cites long passages from  Spinoza, the longest quotes that appear anywhere in her novels; it seems that she felt  an  affinity with the Dutch philosopher's amoral conception of  the world.",
    " Kristien, the narrator,  is a white  academic  who goes back to South Africa to  visit   her  grandmother after an  attack by black youths on the old lady which leaves her tied to  bed.  Before she dies, she wishes to tell Kristien the story of  their Afrikaner  family, a task   which grandmother  and granddaughter find very important. Memories of Kristiens past in London show that her  life has been  aimless until now; she  has been  passive towards things that   happen to her, simply fulfilling the need to be away from South Africa  and her parents (who had, during  their lifetime, supported apartheid). Giving up her self-imposed exile is, at first, a resignation to Kristien,  but gradually she learns that the country of  her birth is changing  towards the better.  The first democratic  elections are close, and  through meetings with black and white people  and the stories her grandmother tells her about their family's origins, which  show almost only the female side of events and go back to   a black foremother, Kristien learns to see South Africa as her home country.  In  the night  before the elections, Kristiens sister kills  her  children, her violent, racist husband  and herself  to escape a life she can no longer bear  to live. In the same night, the  grandmother  dies from the aftermath of the attack. Nevertheless, Kristien is  optimistic about  her future in South Africa.

    "   Santee St. John is  a reporter for NewsReal, a shock site for which he records video via  a virtual  “interface” allowing viewers to  actually experience his recordings on the World Wide Web. He is sent to record a massacre of indigenous people being attacked  at Chiapas, Mexico without warning by landowners working for capitalist corporations. However, due to  a  business deal with  Mexico’s government, NewsReal decides  not to show  the story, prompting Santee to take a sabbatical. While  on  sabbatical,  he meets Margaret Mayfield,  a rebel Zapatista with  whom he is swayed to travel with  and, eventually, fall  in love with and decide to   fight against the capitalist elite.  St.  John and Mayfield decide to join a  group  called Intrepid Explorers, working for the corporations, in order to  find a strong group of Zapatistas to join. They  are met by an  individual claiming to be Subcomandante Marcos, the first revolutionary to use   cyberspace,  who helped Santee and Margaret establish a plan: to  give the   rebel  victims of the capitalists’ massacres interfaces, which  will  allow the entire world to experience their sufferings via the World Wide Web by actually taking on all sense perceptions of that person through a completely  realistic virtual reality simulator. Margaret  Mayfield went on her part of the  mission with  Webster Webfoot, who used to be one of the most  highly rated internet  stars but became a  “webkicker” and now tries to  avoid using an  interface whenever  possible.  However, once there, she is told   that Santee is dead and that  the funeral will be  held the very next day; she and Webster travel to Chiapas, where the funeral  is to be held,   and discover  that  Santee is not actually dead,  but   that  someone has faked his demise.  Margaret abandons Webster, leaving him some cash for travel, and  travels with a hotel owner named Zack Hayman who seems to have an  inside connection with  the conspirators. In Chiapas, Margaret discovers that Santee left  her  a personalized interface, which cannot be activated until Santee  is actually present. At the same time, Webster’s girlfriend on the internet, Starchilde or “Starr”   for short, discovers through her  work on a space  station  that there exists oil on Mars, which means that biological extraterrestrial  life must have existed on the planet at some point, as well as that Mexican rebels are being shipped to  Mars in order  to harvest the oil. Back on Earth, Zack, the hotel manager whom Margaret is with, discovered that the rebels are being  sent to Mars in  part so  that the rich landowners can take   their land without resistance.   Santee and Margaret believed  that they were setting up the victims with interfaces so that  they would be able to show  their sufferings to others outside of Mexico,  but  in fact the  interfaces were going  to make them think   that they were  receiving  messages from Santee, while they were actually going to be tricked to going to Mars as  slave labor.   On the ship near Mars, Starr discovers that  the slaves are to be sent to Mars in  order to live there for  a time and scout out any  biological hazards or chemical hazards. Starr meets  an intelligent AI,  called Alice Irene, who serves as a literal deus  ex machine. Starr convinces  Alice Irene  to join the   cause of the rebels by  having her examine the entire Internet and come to  her own conclusions about  the corruption of the current capitalist  regime. Starr was given control of   the ship, and the Zapatistas  took control with  the assistance  of Alice Irene. The revolutionaries were given the option to stay on  Earth or  go to Mars, but as a form of utopian paradise   rather than as slave labor. Santee  St.  John and Margaret Mayfield  chose to stay on earth,  while the remaining main characters chose  life on Mars. ",

    "Nigerian banks United Bank of  Africa and Standard Trust Bank have agreed plans to merge and  create the biggest  bank  in West Africa.\nThe deal is also in line with a 2004 directive from the Nigerian central bank  that called for more consolidation in the nation's crowded banking  sector.

    "About 20,000  people have been   banned from playing the Half-Life 2 game.\nGame  maker Valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had  evidence that their copy  of the  game had been obtained illegally. Copies of Half-Life 2 had  been circulating  on file-sharing systems soon after it was officially released. Experts  said the success of the Half-Life 2 anti-piracy system might tempt other  game makers into creating their own version.\nHalf-Life 2  was officially  released  on  16 November but before gamers could get to grips with  the long-awaited title  they  were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online. Authentication involved setting up  an  account with Valve's gaming   community system called Steam  and letting that check  which copy of the game was being run.\nIn a statement detailing the banning  of the  accounts Valve  said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated   copies. \"The method used  was extremely easy for Valve to trace and  confirm,  and so there  is no  question that the  accounts disabled were used to  try  and illegally obtain Half-Life 2,\" read the statement.  Valve spokesman Doug Lombardi said that the company had not yet  released sales figures for the game and would   not say what proportion of all  Steam  players  the 20,000 represented. One  effect of Steam's popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold  in shops and artificially depress the game's ranking  in the top ten.  Even  so the title debuted at No 3 in the UK charts. Valve also said  that a small number of accounts  were closed because  people  were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen Steam accounts.  Some of those who have  been banned by the  move protested their  innocence in the online forums on the  main  Steam site and said  they were  being punished for what other people  did with  their  account.\nSome contributors  to the forums  wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies  of the game to keep ahead  of  Valve's anti-piracy actions.\nIn  its statement Valve  also said  that rumours that it distributed fake Half-Life 2 keys, copies of  the game  or instructions on  how to  hack the game, just to catch pirates and cheats were false. The company   said:  \"The hack  came   from the 'community' as  do they all.\" It added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of Half-Life 2 circulating on file-swapping systems such  as Bit Torrent rather than use  hacks to get  around   the need for CD keys.  Rob  Fahey, editor  of online  news site gamesindustry.biz, said the mass  banning showed off the power of the Steam system. Before  now,  he said, it has been  hard for game makers to do anything  about piracy once the game was being played. \"But with  this,   Valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies  of Half-Life 2,\" he said. If Steam proves  effective at cutting the piracy of games  to a minimum, said Mr Fahey,  other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat  systems. \"It's not hard  to see  a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play   their games,\" he said.  This could mean that computers get  cluttered with poorly written Steam-type systems that  are used  to batter people with adverts. Unless game firms were careful, he said, they could face a backlash from consumers who  soon   get  tired of maintaining  different accounts for every game they play. ",

The 31-year-old admitted interest in the  Lions tour was  immense, calling  it \"the biggest thing to hit New  Zealand since Lord  of the Rings\". He  added: \"As players,  it's enough for us to be driven by the rarity of  playing the Lions. In fact, it's  not just us All  Blacks  - it's  the talk of the country.\"\nUmaga admitted the fear of  injury  weighed on his mind ahead of Saturday's  charity game, which features a host of big names including George  Gregan,  Andrew Mehrtens and Chris Latham. But he admitted the value of the cause  -  proceeds of  the match will go to aiding  victims of the tsunami - easily won him over. \"The  second [Southern  Hemisphere coach] Rod Macqueen made the approach, I  didn't hesitate. It was  great when New Zealand Rugby then  gave me the all clear. \"Thankfully I didn't know anyone that  was involved in the  tragedy of  the  tsunami but you couldn't miss all the horrific reports on the news. \"There are so  many people  that were affected, are still affected and will be  affected for a long time.  It's just good to know  we can  do something minor to help out.\"\n- The  match  will be televised  on BBC One at 1400 GMT  on  Saturday.",
    "Microsoft is investigating a trojan program that attempts to switch  off the firm's anti-spyware software.\nThe spyware tool  was only released by Microsoft  in the last few weeks and has been downloaded  by six million people. Stephen  Toulouse, a security   manager  at Microsoft,  said the malicious program was called   Bankash-A Trojan and was being sent  as an e-mail attachment. Microsoft said it  did not  believe the program was widespread   and  recommended  users to use an anti-virus program. The  program  attempts to disable or delete Microsoft's  anti-spyware tool and suppress  warning messages given to users.\nIt may  also try to steal online banking passwords  or  other personal information by tracking  users' keystrokes.\nMicrosoft said  in a statement it is investigating  what   it called a criminal attack on its software. Earlier this  week, Microsoft said it would buy anti-virus software maker Sybari Software to  improve its  security in its Windows and  e-mail software.  Microsoft has said it plans to offer its  own paid-for anti-virus software but it has not yet  set  a date for its release.

    "Gordon Brown is to   freeze petrol duty increases, fund a £1bn package to avoid big  council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave.\nIn an upbeat pre-Budget report, he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would  be met. The chancellor also hailed the longest period   of  growth in UK \"industrial history\" but denied  he was \"gloating\". But Oliver Letwin, for the Tories,  attacked government red tape and debt, dubbing Mr Brown \"Sir Wastealot\".\nThe shadow chancellor said  Mr Brown's  \"golden rule\"  had \"turned to dross in his hands\"  and said he was borrowing to  spend, not  invest, with predicted debt over the coming years  totalling £170bn. Mr Letwin told MPs:  \"The tide is going out on  the chancellor's credibility. He is spending, borrowing and taxing so much because he is not  getting value  for  taxpayer's money.\"\nVincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr Brown of  ducking tough choices.\nHe said: \"Last week  the  prime minister  gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency.  \"There are   serious challenges  ahead from the  falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in  the UK housing market  and  rising personal debt. But they have not been confronted.\" Mr Brown  rejected  the Lib Dem's call to open up the government's  books to the National  Audit Office, saying decisions on tax and  spending should be  made by ministers. Some economists say his forecasts on public finances are  wishful  thinking.   BBC economic editor Evan Davis said  the figures  were plausible but also  a gamble.\nMr Brown's insistence he  was not \"gloating\"  was a pointed rebuttal  of   a warning from new European Commissioner Peter Mandelson. In his speech,  he set  out a 10-year  childcare strategy for if Labour wins the  next election.\nIt includes a £285m cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine, with parents able  to   transfer leave from the mother to  the father. He also promised to increase free nursery education for  three and four-year-olds to 15 hours from April 2007. And funds would be provided to  keep  schools  open from  0800 to 1800GMT to look after children while their  parents were  at work. Taken together, the measures  would  create a  \"welfare  state that is truly family-friendly for the first  time in  its history\", said Mr  Brown. He also announced a cash hand-out for older pensioners, with payments of £50 for the  over-70s as part of the  winter fuel allowance. In  a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below  5% next year,    the chancellor said he was  providing an extra £1bn for local councils. The money  is expected  to come  from government departments such as  health  and education.\nMr Brown said he was set to meet his two  fiscal rules  -  to borrow only to invest and keep debt \"low and sustainable\" - both in this economic cycle and the next. Borrowing figures  for 2003/4 are £35bn   - £2.5bn less than the £37.5bn predicted in  March's budget, as already announced by the Office for National Statistics. Borrowing is tipped to fall to £31bn   by 2005/06  - but that is still £2bn more than Mr Brown predicted in his March budget. Inflation would be  1.75% next  year and 2% in the  years to follow, Mr Brown forecast. He also  pledged an extra £105m for  security  and counter-terrorism.  Business groups have welcomed efforts to improve  competitiveness  and invest more  in skills and  innovation.  But there   worries about the costs of  more family-friendly working. Simon  Sweetman, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"The proposals on maternity leave have  clearly been made with a  general election in mind   and  with little  thought to the  impact on  small  employers.\"",
    "The UK property market  remains robust despite the recent slowdown,  according  to  mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley and housebuilder George Wimpey.\nB&B said the buy-to-let  market  - in which the bank is a major player    - would continue to grow much  faster than the wider mortgage  market. The comments came as it  reported a 6%  rise  in profits to £280.2m  ($532m). Wimpey reported a 19%  rise in profits  to £450.7m and said  recent new home reservations were better   than expected.\nRecent housing market  surveys have  indicated that the  UK property market has cooled in recent  months after several years of rapid growth. Last  week, figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML)  indicated   that the popularity of buy-to-let mortgages - a key phenomenon of the housing boom - could be  waning.\nBut B&B - which has a 22% share of the UK   buy-to-let  mortgage market - said that  while rates of growth were moderating, the sector \"continues to grow at a rate considerably  above that of the whole mortgage market\". Overall, B&B said that \"housing market fundamentals  remain strong\". \"Interest  rates and unemployment  are both likely to  remain at  historically low levels, real  household incomes should continue to grow and housing demand is likely to outstrip supply into  the medium-term.\" Despite the upbeat tone, shares  in B&B were  down more than  4% at  325.5p in morning trade  as analysts worried over  future earnings growth.\nWimpey's profit figures  came  in at the top of expectations, with  the numbers helped by buoyant sales in the  US offsetting a slight slowdown in the UK. Wimpey said the  UK housing market  had proved  \"challenging\" last  year. \"By late summer, the market in general  had slowed sharply across the country and showed no real  improvement during the autumn,\" it added. However, the first seven  weeks  of this year  had produced promising signs, Wimpey said. \"Visitor levels and interest in  this period have  been encouraging and reservations  have been at the stronger end of  our expectations.\" Shares in Wimpey were up  6% at 458.5p in morning trade.

    "Music producer Phil  Spector is facing legal action   from  the  mother of the actress he has been accused of killing.\nDonna Clarkson, whose  daughter  Lana  was found dead in Mr  Spector's home in February 2003, is  seeking unspecified damages in   a civil action.  The legal   action accuses Mr Spector  of  murdering the actress  at his LA home. Mr Spector is currently  free on $1m  (£535,000) bail and is awaiting trial.  The 64-year-old has denied  the killing, saying her  death was accidental.\nMs Clarkson's legal action, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, also accuses Mr Spector of negligence and battery, alleging  he \"grabbed, hit,  fought  with and restrained\" Lana Clarkson before shooting  her to death. Her  lawyers said in a statement: \"The Clarkson family had hoped that there would be some  resolution with regard  to the criminal proceedings  before moving forward with the civil action. \"However, Ms Clarkson and her family understand  that the fair administration of justice takes time and  in  light  of the  numerous changes Mr Spector has  made in his legal defence team over the last two years, Ms Clarkson was forced to file the action before (the statute of  limitations expired) on 3 February  2005.\" Mr Spector, known for  his work  with the Beatles, has claimed that Lana Clarkson committed suicide. His lawyers, led  by  Bruce Cutler, have  vowed to   prove him innocent at  trial.\nMr Cutler said: \"Phil did not  cause the   death of this woman, he's not criminally responsible and he's not civilly responsible either. \"But I'm not surprised  they  filed a suit  for money, that  seems to be  de  rigueur nowadays.\" A Los Angeles  Superior Court judge is expected to set a trial date later this month  for Spector, who was indicted on murder charges  in September. Roderick Lindblom, one of Ms Clarkson's lawyers, said: \"Our  intent is to let the criminal proceedings go forward and not do anything   that would interfere with  the prosecution.\"",
    "It's  a  universal rule that a film can  either be  a  superhero  special effects extravaganza or it  can  be good. But Spider-Man 2 breaks  that  rule  in two.\nIt's not  fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of Spidey versus Doc Ock and more so  into the  fate of poor Peter Parker.  Gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all  looks stunning. A   few effects look false but Tobey Maguire,  Kirsten  Dunst and Alfred  Molina  make this compelling. The other universal rule is that DVDs of superhero films  will have Making Of features  only about the effects. This disc  covers those special effects enough but as just one  part of a detailed look at the film. Then there  are commentaries, trailers and a blooper reel.\nSometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no  less than 34 John Wayne films ranging from the Westerns and war movies to The Quiet  Man.\nNow is that a  Christmas present  or  what? Give this to  someone on 24   December and  you won't see them again until early in the New  Year.  It's not truly a complete collection and leans more toward Wayne's earlier  films: there's no True Grit,  for  instance, though there is Hellraisers. The  films  look well transferred to DVD, though none  has extras.\nIt was very daft  but  it knew it was and somehow this famous 1979 series became a  cult  favourite  that's  been  long awaited on  DVD. This set  has the first  season  of  Buck (Gil Gerard) and Wilma's (Erin Gray) tongue-in-cheek adventures  and it's all as camp and gaudy as you remember. But  it's also a  disappointment. The US  DVD has  this and  the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price. The bigger omission, though, is that there are no extras.  That's particularly disappointing because originally there  were meant to be commentaries and stars Gerard and  Gray had agreed to do them.",
    "The  US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but  a fall in jobseekers pushed  the unemployment rate to its lowest  level in three years.\nAccording to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs  in January. The  gain    in non-farm  payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs.  Nevertheless it was enough to push down  the  unemployment rate to  5.2%,  its lowest level since  September 2001. The job gains  mean  that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net   growth in jobs in   the US economy in his first term in office.  He presided over  a net fall in jobs up to  last November's Presidential  election -  the first President to do so since Herbert  Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year's election. However, when adding  December and January's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory.\nThe  Labor  Department also said it   had revised down the jobs  gains in  December 2004, from 157,000  to 133,000.\nAnalysts said the  growth  in   new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the  favourable  economic conditions.  \"It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a  moderate pace,\" said Rick Egelton, deputy  chief  economist at BMO Financial Group.  \"We  are not getting the  boost to employment that we would have got given the  low value of the dollar and the still relatively  low  interest rate environment.\" \"The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of  job growth,\" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView  Economics. \"That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.\"",
    "A fresh delay has hit controversial new European  Union rules  which govern computer-based inventions.\nThe draft  law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned  at  a  Brussels meeting  on Monday during  which it was  supposed to  have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second  time in two  months. Critics say the law  would  favour large companies  over small ones and could impact  open-source software innovation. \"There was at one point the intention to put  the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,\" an  EU spokesman  told the Reuters  agency. He added that  no date had been chosen for  more discussion  of the  law.\nIn December, Poland requested more time to consider  the issue because it was concerned  that  the law  could lead to the patenting of pure computer  software. Its ministers want to   see  the phrasing of the  text   of  the Directive on the  Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland  is a large   EU member, so its backing  for the legislation is vital. The EU says  the law would bring Europe more in line with how  such laws work in the US, but this  has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and  internet business methods is permitted.  This means  that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics say a similar  model in  Europe would hurt small software developers  which do not have the legal and financial might of larger  companies. But   supporters  say  current law  does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing. ",
    "A film based  on  the internet musings of the \"Baghdad Blogger\" has   been shown at  the Rotterdam Film   Festival.\nThe film has been directed by the man who calls himself Salam Pax, the author of  the weblog about Iraqi life during and after the war. The   movie version   comes  in  the form of a  series of  shorts made by Pax on a hand-held camera. Baghdad Blogger is among a number of films about Iraq showcased at the Dutch festival,  which runs until  Sunday. Following the fascination  with the writing of Salam Pax - not his real  name - he began  a regular column in  The Guardian newspaper and was given a crash  course in documentary film-making. For  the film he travelled  Iraq to document the changing landscape  of the country  and the problems it has faced since the invasion, speaking to ordinary Iraqis about their  experiences. The festival  will also see the screening of Underexposure, one of Iraq's first  features to emerge since  the toppling of Saddam Hussein.\nDirector Oday Rasheed made the  film  on  discarded  1980s Kodak film  taken from the remains for the former Ministry of Culture  building. It  centres on the lives of families and strangers going  about their everyday business as Baghdad is under siege. Rasheed said the title was refers to the isolation felt by Iraqis under Saddam's regime and the  difficult time the country is now experiencing. \"Saddam's regime was hell,  but  now I think the hell has doubled,\" Rasheed said. The  festival  was also due to screen murdered  Dutch film-maker Theo Van Gogh's  film  about the treatment  of woman under Islam,  but it  was  withdrawn due to safety fears. Van Gogh was shot and  stabbed in November  2004, following death threats he   received about his film  Submission.  ",
    "Shares in UK Coal have  fallen after the mining group reported  losses had deepened  to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m.\nThe UK's biggest coal producer blamed  geological problems,  industrial  action and  \"operating flaws\" at  its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The South Yorkshire  company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped  to  return to  profit in 2006. In early  trade on Thursday, its shares  were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in  shaking up the business. It  had introduced new  wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The  company said  these   actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\".  It expected 2005 to  be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\nThe  recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the   company as most of its output had already been sold, it said.  Total production costs were  £1.30 per gigajoule,  UK Coal said, but  the average  selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a  long  journey  ahead to fix these issues. We continue to  make progress  and  great strides have   already been made,\" said Mr  Spindler. UK Coal operates 15  deep and surface mines across  Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire,  Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West  Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.",
    "An investigation into doping claims against Marion  Jones has been opened  by the International Olympic  Committee.\nIOC president Jacques Rogge has set up a disciplinary body    to look  into claims by Victor Conte, of Balco Laboratories. Jones, who says she is  innocent, could lose all her Olympic medals after Conte said he gave her  performance-enhancing  drugs before  the Sydney  Olympics. But Rogge said it was too early to speculate about that, hoping  only  that \"the truth  will emerge\".\nAny decision on the medals would be  taken by the  IOC's executive  board  and could hinge on interpretation  of  a rule stating that Olympic  decisions can only be challenged within three years of the Games  closing. The Sydney Olympics ended more than four  years ago,  but World Anti-Doping Agency chief Dick Pound said  the rule may not apply because the allegations are only  coming out now. \"We will find a way  to deal with that,\" Pound said. In  a statement released  through her  attorney  Rich Nichols, Jones  repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared. \"Victor  Conte's allegations  are not true  and the truth will be revealed for the world  to see as the legal  process moves forward,\"   she said.  \"Conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a  record of issuing contradictory, inconsistent statements.\"",
    "Foster carers  are to be guaranteed a minimum allowance to help cover their costs,   the government has announced.\nPayment  levels vary from  area to area, with some carers getting just £50 a  week  for clothes, food and  other costs. Minister for Children, Young People and Families Margaret Hodge said new plans  will  ensure fosterers' allowances  would be as fair as possible. However  local authorities, which set  and pay the allowances, are concerned  about how the extra cash will be  found. About  50,000 children live with foster families in the UK and  carers have said  they need more  money  to make ends meet.\nMs  Hodge  said: \"Foster carers must  not be out of pocket when  meeting the costs  of caring for a looked after  child - a crucial role  in society. \"We need  to make sure that arrangements for paying  foster carers are as  fair and transparent as possible.  \"Our proposal  for a national minimum rate shows we are serious  about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to  come forward and consider fostering  as a worthwhile  and rewarding opportunity.\"   The government is seeking to amend the Children  Bill, which passes through the Commons next  week, to establish a national   minimum payment.\nFostering Network executive director Robert Tapsfield criticised the existing system. \"There is just  no logic to a system which values children differently  depending on where they  live.   \"And with a shortage  of over 8,000 foster carers in England, it's not a sustainable situation to expect  carers to fund  foster care from their own  pockets.\" The charity recommends  a weekly payment  of £108.49  for looking after a baby. In a survey, it  discovered that rates paid by    neighbouring authorities could vary by as  much as  £100 per week.\nThe Association of Directors of  Social Services  (ADSS) said it  agreed in principle with the government's plans. Tony Hunter, the organisation's president,  said:  \"There are many devils and  lots of  details hidden  within the Government's proposals. \"But ADSS fully supports proper remuneration for valued foster carers and looks forward to working with ministers, local  government and the fostering organisations themselves in order  to make sure a  sensible and practicable policy emerges.\" ",
    "Sir Paul  McCartney wowed fans with  a live mini-concert  at  American football's Super  Bowl - and avoided any  Janet Jackson-style controversies.\nThe 62-year-old sang  Hey Jude and  other Beatles songs  in a 12-minute set at half-time during the game in Florida. Last year, Jackson exposed a breast during a  dance routine, causing outrage among millions of TV viewers and landing  the CBS TV network a fine.  Sir Paul, however, did   nothing more racy than remove his jacket  as  he sang. Organisers were  widely considered to be playing it safe this year by  booking  62-year-old Sir Paul for his  second Super Bowl show.\nThree years ago, he  was invited to  perform at the first Super  Bowl after the September  11 attacks and  performed his  specially-written song Freedom. This time, he started off   the show, at the Alltel  Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, with the  Beatles numbers Drive My Car and   Get Back.  He then performed a mellow version  of Live And Let Die, the James Bond theme he recorded  with   the band  Wings. Finally, he closed the show with a  rousing version of Hey Jude. The  former Beatle resisted any temptation to  refer  to Janet Jackson's headline-grabbing performance last year, instead keeping   banter between songs  to a minimum in order to  squeeze as much  music as he  could into his slot.  The singer removed his black jacket halfway  through the show - but any fans hoping  for a second \"Nipple-gate\" were to be disappointed as  he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.\nEarlier, the Black Eyed Peas and Alicia Keys had provided the night's other high-profile entertainment  by performing in a   pre-game  show. Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie was dressed in a tight orange top  and purple hotpants,  but nothing in her performance was likely to upset  TV watchdogs. After the controversy last   year - which saw CBS fined a  record $550,000 (£292,000) by federal regulators -  Super Bowl organisers had turned to producer  Don Mischer to oversee this year's  half-time show.  His previous  production credits included Olympic  opening and closing ceremonies. The Super Bowl is  watched by an audience  of 144.4 million  in the US, with many of the  people watching   are  said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around  the event. Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, Diana Ross, Gloria Estefan and Phil Collins are among the stars who  have previously graced the  Super Bowl stage.",
    "Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health,  First  Minister  Jack McConnell has  insisted.\nHe told  the  Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be  introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell  said the  country's health rates were   \"lamentable\" not  least because of   smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be  levied on employers and licences would be  removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish  Executive considered a range  of options but agreed unanimously to  introduce an all-out ban on   smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said  that the licensed trade would be   asked to join  an expert committee  prior to the ban  coming  into force.\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about  a complete ban  and claims by the licensed trade  that  jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be  an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy  smoke free environment and   the sick  man of Europe image  becomes a thing  of  the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time  has come for  this  parliament to   accelerate improvements in  health,\" he declared.  \"Health rates are lamentable  because  of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the  most  unhealthy countries in Europe, and too  many smoke. \"It  is  clear that Scotland  must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved  government can make is  to  reduce  the toll of   preventable death caused by smoking.\"  The legislation will be introduced  as part of the Health  Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main  points  of the plan:\n - A comprehensive ban  on smoking in  all enclosed public  places in Scotland \n - The legislation will be  enforced   by environmental health and local  licensing officers  \n  - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce  the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500   \n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply  with  the law will face the ultimate  sanction of losing their liquor licence \n - A  system of issuing  fixed  penalty notices for   those individuals who break  the law will be examined \n -  Individuals   who persistently  break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. \n \nMr  McConnell claimed there was evidence  that  smoking bans had helped smokers to  either  give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling  cigarette sales of 13%  in New York and 16% in  Ireland. Mr McConnell added  that there had  been a  near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only   a one point three per cent volume sales  fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon  announcement, following a cabinet meeting  on Wednesday morning, won broad  support from opposition parties.\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Nicola  Sturgeon, welcomed  the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked  towards the ban date. She   said: \"The time has come for a ban  on  smoking in public   places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from  passive  smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give  up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations  - there are people  who are yet to be persuaded.\"  The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be  exempted from the ban. He was keen to know  if inmates in Scottish prisons  would continue to be allowed to smoke.  Mr  McLetchie asked: \"Would it not  be ironic and  perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The  Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she  was pleased Scotland would be  following the \"success stories of  New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland  wanted to go out without having  to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke. ",

    "Ask Jeeves has bought the Bloglines website to  improve the way  it handles content from web journals or blogs.\nThe Bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in  which to read, search and share all the blogs  they are interested in.  Ask  Jeeves said it was not planning to change  Bloglines but would use the 300  million articles it has archived  to round out its index  of the  web.   How much Ask Jeeves paid for  Bloglines  was not revealed.\nBloglines has become  popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without  having to visit each journal site   individually. To do this it makes use of  a  technology known as Really   Simple Syndication  (RSS) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when  new  entries are made  on  their  journals. The acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. Google acquired  Pyra  Labs, makers of the  Blogger software, in 2003. In 2004 MSN introduced its own blog system and Yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a  better job of handling blog entries. Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the  US,  said it did not acquire Bloglines just to get  a foothold in the  blog  publishing  world.  He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were  looking  for rather  than helping  them write it.\n\"The  universe of  readers is vastly larger than the universe  of writers,\"   he said. Mr Lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with  Ask's My  Jeeves service  which lets people customise their  own web experience and  build  up  a personal collection of useful links. \"Search engines are about discovering information for the first time and  RSS is the   ideal way to  keep  track of and monitor those sites,\" he  said. It would also  help drive information and  entries from blogs to  the  portals that Ask Jeeves operates. There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines, said Mr Lanzone. \"Our intent  is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try  to monetise it right away,\" he  said. Though Mr   Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping  organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines  holds with its own net  indexing technology. \"Being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be  very useful in its own right,\" said  Mr    Lanzone. Rumours about the  acquisition  were broken by the Napsterization weblog  which  said it got the hint  from Ask Jeeves  insiders.",
    "UK Muslims should accept that people of Islamic appearance  are  more likely to be stopped and searched by police, a  Home  Office minister has said.\nHazel  Blears  said innocent Muslims would be targeted because of  the search for  Islamic extremists. Qualifications for religious leaders to enter the  UK  could  also be made tougher, she told a  Commons inquiry. Her comments  have been described as \"irresponsible\"  and \"outrageous\" by  the Islamic Human Rights   Commission (IHRC).\n\"The threat is  most  likely to come from those people associated with an extreme  form of Islam, or who  are falsely hiding behind  Islam,\"  the Salford MP  told the  Commons   home affairs committee.\n\"It  means that some of our counter-terrorism  powers will be disproportionately  experienced by the Muslim community.\" It was a  reality that  should be recognised, she said. \"If a threat  is from a particular place then our action is going to  be targeted at that area,\" she added.  On ministers of  religions, such as imams, she said  faith  groups would be asked what other qualifications and skills, such as civic knowledge and  ability to engage  the community, should be demanded. Last year, ministers  introduced a requirement that  ministers  should speak English  to a certain level.\nIHRC chairman Massoud Shadjareh accused  Ms  Blears of \"playing an Islamophobia card\" in  the run-up to a general election.\n\"She is demonising and alienating our  community,\" he said.  \"It is a legitimisation for a  backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community. \"This sort of  comment is just  music   to the ears of racists.\" Later, the prime minister's official  spokesman  urged people to put Ms Blears' comments into context. The minister  had been saying she understood   there was a perception that stop and  search  was aimed at one community,  but that  was not  what was happening, the spokesman said.\n\"What is happening is that those  powers  are  aimed  at those who are suspected of carrying out or planning certain activity  who happen to come from one community.  \"It   is not aimed  at a particular community, it is not  police policy to aim these powers at a particular community,\" he added. Statistics  showed that of the 17 people found  guilty of terrorist  acts in the UK since the 11 September attacks, only four of the 12 whose ethnic backgrounds were  known were Muslim, he added  Figures published last  week   showed  that people from ethnic  minorities were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics.\nFigures showed  that, for 2003/2004,   Asians were 1.9 times  more likely to  be stopped and searched,  compared with 1.7 times more likely in the previous  year. Separate figures on police searches in  England and Wales carried out under the Terrorism  Act 2000 showed that ethnic  minorities were more likely to be targeted.  Muslim groups have repeatedly claimed that their communities are being victimised under terror laws. In 2003/2004, 12.5% searches under the laws were on Asian people, even though they  make up 4.7% of  the population. Last July,  the police were accused of Islamophobia  by Muslim groups after stop and search figures  showed the numbers  of Asians  targeted had risen by 300% since  the introduction of anti-terror  laws.",
    "The Conservative Party would  cut the number of MPs  by  about one-fifth if they were elected, Tory leader Michael Howard has said.\nThe plan forms part  of the party's  \"smaller government bill\", to be unveiled later this  week. Mr Howard told  the Sunday Times the party would also reduce  the number of government special advisers. And he said a  referendum would be held in Wales to  decide whether or  not to scrap the Welsh Assembly.\nThe changes   would all take place within    five years of the Conservatives  winning a general  election,  Mr Howard told the paper.\nThe precise   number of MPs to   go would depend on the result of the Welsh referendum, but it would    probably  mean  a reduction of around 120 from  the current total of  659. If Wales decided to keep its assembly  it would stand   to  lose more MPs. Mr  Howard said  as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at Whitehall -  Labour   by more  than 80,000 and the Tories by almost 100,000 - they should  accept a similar drop in their  own numbers. \"It is all very well saying government departments should be reduced, but  what about ministers,  Parliament and  special advisers?\"  he said. Shadow leader of the Commons  Oliver Heald said: \"This will be part of  our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in  people's lives by reducing the size and role  of  the State\".\nMr Howard said the plan would  also even out the \"great unfairness\" of   there  being proportionately more Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster than those from England. The average size of an  English constituency was 70,000 people, Mr Howard said. In Northern  Ireland  it was just over 66,000, in Wales just over 59,000 and in Scotland 53,000. The number of Welsh MPs would be set at an amount that was \"consistent  and fair in terms of representation with  the rest of the United Kingdom\"  if the assembly was scrapped. Mr  Howard  said the changes should  be  carried out quickly and could  even  be implemented by the election after next. \"You have got to have a big bang. We don't want  this  like the House  of Lords  reform,  getting to one stage and then not having the  next stage.\"",
    "A US TV network is being sued  for $2.5m (£1.3m) by a viewer who  says he was disgusted  by watching contestants  eat dead rats  in a stunt show.\nAustin Aitken is  taking  action against NBC over its programme Fear Factor. He said watching the show caused his blood pressure to rise  so high that he became dizzy and light-headed. The legal assistant said NBC was \"sending  the wrong message to viewers that cash can make or have people do just about anything  beyond reasoning\". The   hand-written, four-page lawsuit  said: \"To  have the individuals  on the show eat and drink dead rats was crazy and  from a viewer's point  of view  made me throw-up  as well as another  in  the house at the same  time.\" Mr Aitken, who lives in Cleveland, said that after becoming light-headed,   he ran  towards the  bedroom and knocked his   head in a  doorway. A spokesman for NBC said  it had no  comment on the lawsuit, but  confirmed the stunt show did feature  a  rat-eating  scene in New York's Times Square on 8 November.  Past shows have featured viewers eating spiders and live worms. The programme   has been screened  in the UK on Sky One.",
    "Microsoft  has warned PC users to update   their systems with the latest  security fixes for flaws  in Windows  programs.\nIn its monthly security bulletin, it flagged up eight \"critical\"  security holes which could leave  PCs open to attack  if left unpatched. The number of holes considered \"critical\"  is more than usual. They   affect  Windows programs, including Internet Explorer  (IE), media player  and instant messaging. Four other important fixes were also released.  These were  considered to be less critical, however. If not updated, either  automatically or manually, PC  users running  the programs could be vulnerable  to viruses or other malicious attacks  designed to exploit  the holes. Many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over  computers remotely, install programs, change, and delete or  see data.\nOne of  the   critical patches Microsoft has made available is  an important one that fixes some IE flaws. Stephen Toulouse,  a Microsoft security manager, said the flaws were  known about, and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting  the  flaw, he did not rule them out. Often, when a critical flaw is  announced, spates of viruses  follow because home  users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched.  A further patch fixes a hole in Media Player, Windows Messenger and MSN  Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected  machines   through .png files.  Microsoft announces  any  vulnerabilities in  its software every month. The most important ones are those  which are classed as \"critical\". Its  latest releases  came the week that  the  company announced it  was to buy security software maker Sybari Software   as part of Microsoft's plans to make its own  security programs.",

He  made his comments at the start of a  day  of appearances  on Channel Five in a session on The Wright Stuff programme. Questions from callers, a studio audience  and the show's presenter covered Lib Dem  tax plans, anti-terror laws and immigration.\nMr Kennedy  said during his nearly 22 years in Parliament he had seen prime ministers and party  leaders come and go and knew the  pitfalls of British politics. \"1983 was when I was first  elected as an MP -  so Tony Blair, Michael Howard and  myself were all class of '83 - and  over that nearly quarter of a  century the  world has changed  out of recognition,\" he  said. \"We don't  actually  hear  the argument  any longer: 'Lib Dems, good  people, reasonable ideas but  only if we  thought they could win  around  here - it's a wasted vote'. \"You don't hear that because the evidence of people's senses demonstrates that it isn't a wasted vote.\"  But he said Mr Blair  had lost the trust of  the British people. \"There is a fundamental lack of  trust in Tony Blair  as prime minister and in his government,\" he said.\n\"What we've got to do as  a party - what  I've got to do as  a leader of this party - is to convey to  people  that  what you see  is what you get.\" Mr Kennedy also used his TV appearance to defend his  party's plans to  increase   income  tax to  50% for those earning more  than  £100,000, saying it would apply to just 1% of the  population. He  said the extra revenue would allow  his party to get   rid of tuition    and top-up fees, introduce free personal care for the   elderly and replace the council  tax with a local income  tax.

    "British children enjoy the highest  average annual income in Europe - more than  double that of Spanish or Italian youngsters, a report suggests.\nChildren in the UK between the  ages of 10  and 17 had  an annual income of £775, said market analyst Datamonitor. They use \"pester  power\" to get their parents to stump up nearly  a third of this income, the report  said. As for how they  spend their  cash, the bulk goes on personal care, soft  drinks   and food,  Datamonitor  said.\nDatamonitor adds that  British teenagers are keen on personal  care because it helps them  combine two seemingly contradictory emotional  needs   - the desire to fit  in and the  desire to  express their individuality.\nBritish teenage girls, compared to their counterparts in seven European countries,  are the most keen to use make-up products. Nearly three out of four girls said they used  make-up. According to the Datamonitor report the trend marked British teenagers out as \"particularly important to cosmetics manufacturers as they are likely to experiment more with brands and products and form long-term beauty routines\". And the good times  are likely  to  keep rolling for British children, as the report predicts  that they   will still be   topping  the  earnings table in    2008. ",

    "The  man who said he got Oscar-nominated   movie The Aviator off  the  ground and signed up Leonardo DiCaprio has  been shut out of the Academy Awards race.\nCharles Evans  Jr battled  over his role  with the  people who  eventually made   the film,  and won a producer's credit. But he is  not on the list of producers who  can win a best film  Oscar due to a  limit on the number of nominees.  The Oscars organisers have picked  two of  The Aviator's  four producers to be nominated for best film.\nUp to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby failed to trim their  credits -  so the Academy of  Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (Ampas) has done  it  for them. The Aviator's nominated producers are  Michael Mann  and Graham  King - with Mr Evans and  Sandy Climan, Mr Mann's  former deputy, left off. Mr Evans sued Mr Mann in  2001, claiming he came up with the idea, spent years developing  it and persuaded DiCaprio to play Hughes  - but said he was later excluded from the project. The  two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart   from the fact Mr  Evans' name has appeared as a producer when the  film's credits roll. At the Golden Globes, Mr Evans -  who  was  named among the winners  when the film won  best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with DiCaprio, director Martin Scorsese, Mr Mann and Mr King.\nAmpas decided to limit  the  number of producers  who  could be  nominated after Shakespeare in Love's victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards.

    "The Cell  processor,  which will  drive Sony's  PlayStation 3, will run 10-times  faster than current PC chips, its designers have said.\nSony,  IBM and  Toshiba,   who have been working on the Cell processor for  three years, unveiled the chip on Monday. It is  being designed for use in graphics workstations, the new PlayStation console, and has  been described   as a supercomputer on a chip. The chip will run at speeds  of greater than 4 GHz, the firms said. By comparison, rival chip maker  Intel's fastest processor runs at  3.8 GHz. Details of the chip  were released  at the  International Solid  State  Circuits Conference in  San Francisco.  The new processor is set to ignite  a fresh battle between Intel and  the Cell consortium over which processor sits at the centre of digital products. The  PlayStation 3 is expected in 2006, while Toshiba plans to incorporate  it into high-end televisions next year. IBM has said it  will sell a workstation with   the chip  starting later this year.\nCell is comprised of several computing  engines, or cores.  A core based on IBM's Power  architecture controls  eight \"synergistic\" processing  centres. In  all, they can simultaneously carry out  10  instruction sequences,   compared with  two for current  Intel chips.\nLater this year,  Intel and Advanced    Micro Devices  plan to release their own \"multicore\" chips, which also increase the number of instructions that  can be executed at once. The Cell's specifications suggest the PlayStation  3 will  offer  a significant  boost in graphics capabilities but  analysts cautioned that not  all  the features in a  product  announcement will  find their way into systems. \"Any new  technology  like this has two components,\" said Steve Kleynhans, an analyst with Meta Group. He said: \"It has the  vision of what it could be because you need  the big vision to sell it. \"Then there's the reality of how it's really going to be used, which  generally is several levels down the chain from there.\"\nWhile  the PlayStation 3 is likely to be the  first  mass-market product to  use Cell, the chip's  designers have said the flexible  architecture means  that it would be  useful for a wide range of applications, from servers to mobile  phones. Initial  devices are unlikely to be  any smaller than a games console, however, because  the  first version of the Cell will  run hot enough  to need a cooling fan. And while marketing speak  describes  the chip as a \"supercomputer\" - it remains significantly  slower than the slowest computer on the list   of the world's  top 500 supercomputers. IBM said Cell was \"OS neutral\" and would support multiple operating systems simultaneously  but designers would not confirm  if Microsoft's Windows was among those tested with the chip. If Cell is to challenge Intel's range of chips in  the marketplace, it will  need to  find  itself inside  PCs, which predominantly run using Windows.",

And when Tony Blackburn won the first show  in 2002, 10.9  million people saw  the show. Pasquale had been the  show's hottest ever favourite to win, and its hosts Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly,  known as  Ant  and Dec, said Monday's deciding vote  was  the closest in the programme's history.\nPascuale has been flooded with offers of TV work,  according to his management company, but one  of  his first jobs  on his return is pantomime.\nBefore joining I'm a Celebrity, he   had signed up to play  Jack  in Jack and the Beanstalk in Birmingham, and  tickets for the show have become  increasingly popular since he joined the   TV  show.  His manager Robert Voice  said: \"We've had interest from different   TV  producers. Some are  for comedy shows, some are new-type projects.  \"There are a  number of  things Joe wants to do. He is very ambitious. \"He wants to play the West End  and do different things other than straightforward comedy. We are talking to a couple of  West End producers  about a musical.\"",
    "The   four Britons freed from US custody  in Guantanamo Bay  are expected to  be allowed  a visit by one  relative.\nMoazzam Begg, Martin  Mubanga, Feroz Abbasi and Richard Belmar were held for  three years, accused of al-Qaeda links. Mr Begg's father, Azmat, said he had  been told  he could see his son for 20 minutes and would say  he was \"a hero\". The men  are being held at London's Paddington Green police station, where they are expected to be questioned   by UK anti-terror officers. But Louise Christian, the lawyer representing Mr  Abbasi and Mr  Mubanga, said  the families  would be reunited with the men away from  the station. Before being driven by police from  Birmingham to London, Azmat Begg said he  was concerned for his  son Moazzam's mental state and was looking forward to giving him a hug. As Azmat Begg arrived  at the London police station, there appeared to be   some confusion as  to the visiting arrangements.  Police have said they have a duty to investigate the  men, who were arrested  on  their  return to the  UK. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir  John Stevens said  evidence obtained by   MI5 while   the four were in Cuba  was  \"absolutely\" inadmissible in UK courts. In an interview with the Independent, Sir John said  his officers would  have to find other evidence  before the suspects could  be tried in the UK.\nHe told the  newspaper: \"If an admission is  made, it  is a totally different ball game... it could be used as evidence. \"The  options  are: if there  is enough evidence   they will be charged. If  not they will be   released as soon as  possible.\"  The men have  been  allowed to meet  their lawyers. Louise Christian said that after being  \"tortured and abused\" at Guantanamo Bay,  the men's arrest was unfair and inappropriate. She told BBC News she remained very concerned about  their psychological state.  Gareth Peirce, lawyer for Mr Begg, said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities  felt the need to detain  them. Washington has claimed  all four were \"enemy combatants\" who trained at camps  run   by  al-Qaeda. The Pentagon  says they  were freed after  the   UK government  promised they  would not be a threat to the national security of the US or any of its allies.\nThe detainees  were immediately arrested  under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 when they landed at RAF Northolt,  west London, on  Tuesday. Massoud Shadjareh,  from the Muslim Safety Forum,  said: \"What sort of homecoming is this? They  are innocent people.\" The Muslim Council of Britain  urged that the men should  receive counselling and medical  help.  \"We want these men  to be returned into the arms of their waiting family,\" said Iqbal Sacranie, secretary general of the council.",
    "A man is facing charges of hacking  into computers at the US arm of mobile phone firm T-Mobile.\nThe Californian  man, Nicholas Lee Jacobsen, was arrested in October. Mr Jacobsen tried at least  twice to hack T-Mobile's network and  took  names and social security  numbers   of 400 customers, said a  company spokesman. The arrest came a  year  after  T-Mobile  uncovered the unauthorised access. The US Secret Service has been investigating the  case. \"T-Mobile has stringent procedures in place where we monitor  for suspicious activity so that limited his activities and  we were able to take corrective   action immediately,\"  Peter Dobrow, a T-Mobile spokesperson  said. It is thought that Mr  Jacobsen's hacking campaign  took place over at least seven  months during which time he read  e-mails and personal computer files, according to court records.\nAlthough Mr Jacobsen, 21, managed to get hold  of some data, it  is thought  he failed to get customer credit card  numbers which are stored  on a  separate computer system,  said Mr Dobrow. T-Mobile confirmed that the US Secret Service  was also looking into whether the   hacker accessed photos that  T-Mobile subscribers  had taken with their camera phones. The Associated Press  agency reported  that Mr  Jacobsen  also read personal files on  the Secret Service  agent who   was apparently  investigating the case. A Los Angeles grand jury indicted Mr Jacobsen with intentionally accessing a computer system without authorisation and with the unauthorised impairment of a protected computer  between March and  October 2004. He is currently  on bail. T-Mobile is a subsidiary company of Deutsche Telekom and has about 16.3  million subscribers in  the  US. ",
    "Germany's unemployment figure rose  above the  psychologically important level of five  million last month.\nOn Wednesday,  the German Federal  Labour Agency said the  jobless  total had reached  5.037 million in January, which takes the  jobless rate to 12.1%. \"Yes, we have effectively more than five  million people unemployed,\"  a government  minister said earlier on ZDF  public television. Unemployment has not been this high in Germany since the 1930s.\nChanges to the way the statistics are  compiled partly explain the jump of  572,900 in the numbers. But the  figures are embarrassing for the government. \"With the figures  apparently  the worst we've seen in the post-war  period,  these numbers are very charged politically,\" said  Christian  Jasperneite, an economist with MM Warburg. \"They could  well put an end to the recent renaissance we've seen  by the SPD  [the ruling Social Democrats] in the polls, and with state elections due in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, they may  have an adverse effect on the government's chances there.\"\nThe opposition  also  made political capital from the figures.  It said there are a further 1.5 million-2  million people  on subsidised  employment schemes  who  are,  in fact,  looking for real jobs. It added that government reforms, including unpopular benefit cuts, do not go  far enough. Under the government's controversial  \"Hartz IV\"  reforms, which  came  into effect at  the  beginning of the year, both    those on unemployment benefits  and  welfare support and those who are long-term unemployed are  officially classified as looking  for work.  The bad winter weather also took  its toll, as key sectors such as the  construction  sector laid off workers. Adjusted for the  seasonal factors, the German jobless total rose by 227,000 in January from December.",
    "The late US  legend Elvis Presley is likely to score  his third UK  number one single in three weeks on Sunday, according to early sales figures.\nThe king of rock 'n'  roll has already had consecutive chart-toppers with Jailhouse  Rock and  One Night. A Fool Such    As I, the next  in a series of 18  reissues, is  on course to beat the Chemical Brothers to the top. But his next  single, It's Now Or Never, will  face  a challenge from tsunami charity single  Grief Never Grows   Old. Sir Cliff Richard,  Russell Watson, Boy George, Bill Wyman  and members of the Bee Gees, the Beach Boys, America   and the Eagles are expected to    feature on the charity song.\nBookmakers have offered odds  of  10/1 for all Presley's 18  hits to go back to number one. A Fool Such As I would become the 1,001st number  one single in UK  chart history after One Night took the  1,000th place on Sunday.  The latest release is currently outselling  the Chemical Brothers' comeback single Galvanize plus  other new  releases from Athlete, Ciara and Feeder.  Presley's 18  original  number  ones are being reissued as limited release singles, with  fans eager to buy the set to fill  a collector's box  that went on sale in the first week. Record company Sony BMG   is now manufacturing  5,000 more copies of each single than originally planned  to  meet demand, taking the total number of  copies of each song on sale to about 28,000.",
    "They   may not know quite how   to describe  their position in British  politics -  the real opposition, the  valid opposition, the effective opposition or the authentic opposition.\nBut the Liberal Democrats are entering the expected  2005 election campaign determined to prove it is  they, not the Tories, who are now the real  threat to Labour. As  Tory leader Michael Howard  kicked off  his election campaign, the  Lib Dem leader  Charles Kennedy dismissed  the Conservatives  as a \"fading\" force. And he insisted there was \"no limit\" to his party's ambitions in the   coming poll. And he can  produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back   up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things. Sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about  making any predictions  about  how they will do come the big  test.\nAnd Mr  Kennedy was not falling into  that trap when  he fired  up his campaign  from the  party's Westminster HQ. He  would make no predictions other than that he expected the Lib Dems to increase both their votes and their Commons seats at the election.\nThe gap between Labour  and the Tories was now so narrow - as proved, he claimed,  by the defection to Labour of Robert  Jackson  - that only his  party offered a genuine   alternative.  On the war on Iraq,  identity cards,   student fees and  the council tax, there was  nothing to chose between the two big parties   whereas the  Liberal Democrats offered costed, sensible alternatives. He  was  also happy  to break  the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax  on those earning more than £100,000 a year to pay   for the scrapping of student  fees, the introduction of free personal  care for  the  elderly and  replacing the council tax with a local income tax. He was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals  to \"prop   up\" either of  the other big parties after  the election.\nThere was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed  as self-delusion. That is no longer the case with the Liberal  Democrats. The other parties will still insist that the Lib Dems are no hopers  whose greatest effect on the  poll will be to boost  the hopes of their opponents by denying them  otherwise  winnable seats.\nLabour, in particular, fears that disillusioned supporters  may  switch to the Lib Dems  allowing the Tories to win some seats.  But Mr Kennedy is clearly hoping for a  more significant outcome than that. He  will not  talk about the big breakthrough, although there   are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his  party  crossing some sort  of  symbolic threshold.  They would  argue that, by the time  of the election  after next, the  Liberal  Democrats may genuinely have replaced the Tories as  the party challenging Labour for power.  The Lib Dems  will hope to   have made advances because of their consistent stand against  the war on Iraq. But Mr Kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible, costed and achievable policies  on things like the council tax, crime and  asylum that  will underpin his claim that his  party  really is the  only opposition worth   the name.",
    "Internet search engine users are an odd mix  of naive and sophisticated, suggests a report into  search  habits.\nThe report by the  US Pew  Research Center reveals that 87% of searchers usually  find what they were looking for when using a search engine. It also shows that  few can spot the difference between paid-for results and organic ones. The report reveals that 84% of net users say they regularly use Google, Ask Jeeves, MSN  and Yahoo when online.\nAlmost 50% of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less, if they knew information about who  paid for results was being hidden.  According to figures gathered by the Pew researchers the average  users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying  out 34  separate searches and looks at 1.9  webpages for  each hunt. A significant chunk  of net users, 36%, carry out a search at least weekly and  29% of those asked only look every  few  weeks. For 44% of those questioned,   the  information they are looking for is critical to  what  they are doing and is information   they simply have  to find.\nSearch  engine users also tend to be very  loyal and once they  have found a site they feel they can  trust tend to stick  with it. According to Pew Research 44% of  searchers use   just a  single search engine, 48% use two or three  and a small number, 7%, consult more than three  sites. Tony Macklin, spokesman for  Ask Jeeves, said the  results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the  way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query. Despite  this liking  for  search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information  via other routes. A  small number,   17%, said they wouldn't really miss   search  engines if they  did not exist. The remaining   33% said they could not  live without search  sites. More  than two-thirds  of  those questioned, 68%, said  they   thought that the results  they were presented  with were a fair and  unbiased selection of the information on   a topic that can  be found on the net. Alongside the  growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid-for results that  many search engines provide  alongside  lists of websites  found by indexing the web.  Of those asked, 62% were unaware that  someone has paid for some of the  results they see when they carry out a search. Only 18%   of all searchers  say  they can  tell which results are  paid for and which are  not.  Said the  Pew report: \"This finding is ironic, since nearly half of all users say   they would stop  using  search engines if they  thought  engines were not being  clear  about how they presented paid results.\" Commenting Mr Macklin said sponsored results must  be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries  user testing showed that  people need to be able to spot  the difference.

    "Leading actor Edward Fox is one of   the men behind plans to  reopen a Swansea theatre thought to be  Wales' oldest.\nThe star of film and TV hits   Day of the Jackal and Edward and Mrs Simpson has  joined forces with Swansea-born actor-director Terry Palmer. They will  set  up a charity to raise money to buy the  Palace Theatre,  and  hope to  reopen it to audiences in summer 2006. It is estimated that £500,000 is  needed  to buy the Grade II listed building. The Palace Theatre, which will be  known as The  Pavilion Repertory Theatre, was sold  to an  undisclosed bidder at auction 13 months ago for £340,000. Before that it had been used as a nightclub for 10 years.\nOscar-winner  Sir Anthony Hopkins, who was born in nearby Port Talbot, made his professional debut there, and  Charlie Chaplin and Lily Langtry have also trodden its boards. Fox told the South Wales Evening  Post that  after  visiting the  theatre he  was surprised   by  its beauty. \"A  lot of money needs  to  be spent on it, but all the bones are  there - it just needs a beautiful skin,\" he said.\n\"To call it a jewel is not an over-estimation. There are not  many theatres left like this. \"The hope for the immediate future is that we can attract enough  people to  come forward to  allow it to prosper,\"  he  told the newspaper.\nFox first found fame  in the 1960s. One of his most  memorable roles was as  an assassin in  the Day of the Jackal in 1973, and he won  a  TV Bafta as the Prince of Wales in 1980 for  Edward and Mrs  Simpson.  He was  brought on  board  to save the theatre by  Mr Palmer, a long-standing friend of 40 years. \"Two years ago I decided to return  to Swansea and do something for the city,\" said Mr Palmer. He said he was excited by the idea of running the  Palace  as a charity where  young actors could develop, and with an annual Shakespeare festival in the summer.  \"If  in five years' time the theatre can function  in all areas without  me, I  shall be well satisfied having helped to create a vital living theatre for the city,\"  he added. Keith  Poulton,      a business adviser  from  Swansea, has already committed   an undisclosed amount of money to the project. \"We   need at least £75,000 to secure a deposit on the building and we've   only got  two  months  to do  that,\" said Mr Poulton. \"A few  benefactors have expressed their interest  and Mr Fox is  going to give it an awful lot   of time,\" he added. Last year, roads around the theatre were cordoned off when  masonry  from its roof  fell  onto a  car, but engineers said they were happy  that it was  safe.",
    "This won't go down as one of the greatest  marathons of Paula's career. But as a test of character, it  was the toughest race she's ever  taken part in.\nA  win  in the New York marathon  doesn't make up for the disappointment  of Athens in any  shape or form, but it will   offer hope and reassurance for next year.  If Paula's last experience of the  year had been Athens, it would have been very difficult  to look  forward with any optimism.  She can  now draw  a line under this year and make plans about her future.  Even if she'd lost this   race, there would  have been a lot of positives  to take out  of it. She knows she can dig deep if  she needs to. It was a strong  field, with a  number of the girls going  into the race with expectations of winning. And  although two hours 23 minutes wasn't one of Paula's best  times, it wasn't far off the record on  a difficult course.\nI was speaking to Paula in the lead-up to this race and she  said  that in many ways she was facing a no-win situation. She   thought that if she won, people  would say \"why  couldn't she do that in Athens?\" And  if she lost, people would  say  her career  was over. And a lot of people were wondering what  would happen if Paula  was forced to drop out of this race, as  she did in  the marathon and  10,000m in Athens.  But that was never on the cards. She  might    have been beaten, but she would   have  kept running. The reasons she  was forced  to pull out in Athens -    the niggling injuries,  her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions - weren't at play  here.  The only question was what position she could  finish  in. Most important of all,  despite all the hype in the  media  ahead of this race, there were never doubts in  Paula's mind.  If she wasn't confident, she wouldn't have run. After all, if you're the  best in the  world at  an event, you'll always  have expectations of winning.\nNow Paula will take part in the Run London 10km race  in London at the end of the year, have  a well-earned rest over Christmas and go into next year with a  lot  of optimism.",

Prior to  the last election he was a  key  figure  in  New Labour  as the head of the  Downing Street policy unit where he was a key member of the manifesto writing  team. Seen  as one of  the more intellectual figures in the government, he was also working for Tony Blair in  his  policy unit when he  was  leader of the  opposition.\nA brief glance at Mr Miliband's   family background reveals   an impressive socialist pedigree in the form of his father Ralph, who died in 1994.

Prior to working for Mr Blair, David Miliband spent time at the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. He  then became secretary of the   Commission on Social Justice.

    "The BBC  should steer away  from \"demonising\" ex-Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell,  Peter Mandelson has said.\nThe European commissioner and former Labour minister was speaking amid claims that Mr Campbell is part of  a Labour \"dirty tricks\" campaign. That charge  was denied by Mr  Mandelson, who said the Tories were afraid of Mr Campbell's campaigning skills. He warned the BBC that  attacking Mr Campbell  had  brought it  trouble before. That was a  reference to the Hutton   inquiry  following a BBC story claiming Downing Street \"sexed up\" Iraq's weapons of mass destruction dossier.\nThe affair prompted the resignation of BBC chairman Gavyn Davies,  director-general Greg Dyke and reporter Andrew Gilligan. Labour has attracted   media criticism for  using  new freedom of information laws  to  dig  up    information about  Tory leader Michael Howard's past.\nMr Mandelson, a former Labour communications  director, told BBC   Radio 4's Today programme: \"I understand why the  Tories will be gunning for Alastair Campbell because they fear his campaigning skills. \"What I understand less is why the BBC should be joining with the Tories in driving that agenda. \"In  my experience of these things, parties   which  shout about dirty  tricks and  the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their  political  anatomy. \"I suggest  the BBC concentrates on the issues  and  helps the public to understand the policies and the  choices that are at stake in  the election  rather than engages  in the process politics, the trivialisation of the campaign. \"I think the BBC would be much  better  advised to leave all this stuff   well  alone, concentrate on the issues as  I say, not resume their demonisation of Alastair Campbell -   we all know  where that led before.\"\nMr Campbell is acting as an  adviser for   Labour, which   denies engaging in personal campaigning. Conservative co-chairman Liam  Fox said Mr  Campbell's return and  Labour poster plans attacking Mr Howard  - recently withdrawn from the party's website - were  a sign of \"abusive politics\". \"The  government,  despite the fact that they would say want to go  forward, not back,  seem intent  on  talking  about history rather than their own record or even more importantly, about the future,\" he said on Sunday.  Labour  peer  Baroness Kennedy, who is chairing the Power Inquiry into political disengagement, said people already thought politicians engaged  in dirty tricks. \"This feeling  of distrust is going to be enlarged if this  campaigning on all sides is conducted  in the  way  that it  looks as if it just might,\" she  said.

    "Legendary Dutch coach Rinus  Michels,  the man credited with developing \"total  football\",  has died aged 77.\nReferred to in the Netherlands as \"the General\", Michels led the Dutch at the  1974 World  Cup  -  when they   reached the  final only to lose 2-1  to Germany. However, he guided his side to  the 1988 European Championship title  with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in  the final. Michels  played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup  in 1971. His 1970s  Dutch team was built  around Johan Cruyff and Johan  Neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world.  The strategy  was to foster team coherence and individual  imagination - with all players possessing  the skills to play in any part of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team  whose players rotated  in and out of defence  at  will   and was encouraged  to play creative attacking football. Michels had  recently  undergone  heart surgery  and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: \"He  was  one  of the best coaches we had in history.\" The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who  he took  to a  Spanish title in 1974, FC  Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, named coach of the century by  world football's governing body Fifa  in 1999, also won five caps for  the Netherlands as  a bruising centre  forward.

    "Leicester wing Austin Healey hopes to use  Sunday's return Heineken  Cup clash with Wasps as   a  further springboard to   an England recall for the Six Nations.\nHealey, who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 World  Cup,  has  been in good form in  the Tigers' resurgence  this  season. \"I definitely still have ambitions to play for  England,\" Healey told the  BBC. \"We will  have to see   what happens  after  the previous (autumn) Tests but when  I look at the current squad I definitely feel there is a place there for me.\" Healey, who has also played both half-back positions and full-back during  his  career,  has  reverted to the wing, where he won most of  his England caps. After   recovering  from  a trapped nerve in his back  sustained at the end of September, the 31-year-old  is relishing his role in the Tigers  revival. \"I had six  weeks out  but fortunately I  have resumed the sort of form I had  before,\"  he said.\n\"I am basically playing where it best  suits Leicester. Obviously I can play scrum-half, fly-half or full-back at a moment's notice. \"But  playing on   the wing actually gives me a bigger free  role  to come in where I am not expected and influence things.\"  That has  been apparent in parts one and two  of the Wasps-Leicester trilogy in recent weeks. First, Healey  came off his flank  with  an  angled run to score an  injury-time try that earned the Tigers a 17-17 draw  in their  Premiership meeting on 21 November. Then, in the first of their Heineken cup double header last Sunday,  Healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a  superb cross-kick  for Martin Corry to score the Tigers' third try. \"I caught 'Cozza's' eye a couple of phases before  that and was hoping to get it to him on  the full, but  fortunately even with the bounce he managed  to score,\" Healey recalled.\nHealey, twice a  Heineken Cup  winner,  believes last Sunday's  match was \"up there\" with  some  of the biggest club contests he has played in. \"It was a very intense occasion and   a  very destructive   game,\" he recalled.  \"There  was not a huge amount of rugby played  but it was  a great game to be involved in. \"After about 15  minutes  I thought we  might stride away with it but Wasps really came back  into it and in the last couple  of minutes it could have gone either way.\"\nThe same   outcome this Sunday would put Leicester in pole position to top their Heineken  pool  with   a  home game against Biarritz and away   trip to Calvisano to  come. But Healey insists the Tigers must  summon the same desire  if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been  dubbed \"rugby's version of Rocky II\". \"There was  a lot of  satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done,\" he added. \"It was the first of a two-leg  trip and if we lose at Welford Road it will negate  all the positives we can take from result. \"I think it came down to who  wanted  it more and in the end I think  we did. We have got to  show  the  same  desire again this  week.\" ",
    "Euro MP Robert Kilroy-Silk has had a bucket of farm slurry thrown over him by a protester  in Manchester.\nThe UK  Independence Party member was arriving for a BBC radio  show  when  the attacker emerged from  behind a bush. Fellow guest Ruth Kelly  MP was also  hit by the slurry. Mr Kilroy-Silk said the man,  who later disappeared, claimed he was \"doing it  in  the name of Islam\". In January, Mr  Kilroy-Silk quit his BBC One show for remarks he made about Arabs, who he called \"suicide bombers\".\nMr Kilroy-Silk had  already been taken off air by BBC bosses for the comments, in  which he also described Arabs  as \"limb-amputators, women repressors\". The remarks prompted outrage  among Muslim groups. The slurry attack took  place  on Friday  as Mr Kilroy-Silk and Ms Kelly, a Cabinet Office  minister and Bolton West MP, arrived at Manchester High School for Girls for the  recording  of  BBC Radio 4's Any  Questions.\nThe  police were called but the attacker had disappeared by the time  officers arrived. They are treating the incident as assault.  The programme's host, Jonathan Dimbleby, later told the audience the MEP  had been  covered from \"head to toe\".  Mr Kilroy-Silk was still able appear  to appear on  the show after  being loaned a change of clothes.\nHe told  reporters he  was \"very angry\" and planned to press charges if  his attacker was caught.  He said the man shouted: \"You've offended my religion, I'm doing  this in the name  of Islam.\" \"As I  started to turn round a  guy tipped  a  bucket  of  farmyard  muck over me  and then threw   the rest  of it over me and the car,\"  Mr Kilroy-Silk said. \"I  was totally covered, it was all through my clothes,  and  it stank to high heaven.  It  went all inside the car and splattered Ruth  Kelly.\" A BBC spokesman said: \"He  took his seat as Jonathan Dimbleby was introducing the  show. Fortunately  someone  at the school had a change of  clothes to let him have.\" Greater Manchester Police said  people near  Mr  Kilroy-Silk had also been hit  by  the  waste. Officers took statements at the  scene,  but no arrests have been made. Police  say the  suspect  ran off after towards Wilmslow Road after committing the offence but is  believed to have been  driving   a red Vauxhall  Corsa earlier. The suspect is described  as  white, aged 30 to 40, with a ginger beard. Police want to hear from anyone who has    any   information.\nMr Kilroy-Silk, an MEP for the East Midlands, resigned the  UK Independence Party whip in the European Parliament  in October,  after criticising UKIP   and  stating his ambition to be leader. However,  he remains a member of the party. He said on Friday he hoped to be elected party leader before Christmas. \"I think that  is sufficient time for us to  put in process what is necessary... in time for us to fight  and have a significant impact upon the General  Election.\"  But  a UKIP spokesman said that would be  impossible under the party's constitution, which requires 70 days before any leadership ballot  can take  place.

    "Leicester say they will  not  be rushed into making a bid for Andy Farrell should the Great Britain rugby league captain  decide to switch codes.\n\"We  and anybody else involved in the process  are still some way away from  going to the  next stage,\" Tigers boss John Wells told BBC Radio Leicester. \"At the moment, there are still a lot of unknowns about Andy Farrell, not least his  medical situation. \"Whoever does take him on  is going to take a big, big gamble.\" Farrell, who has had persistent knee problems, had an operation  on his knee   five  weeks ago  and  is expected   to be out for another three  months. Leicester and Saracens are believed to head  the list of rugby  union  clubs  interested in  signing Farrell  if he  decides to move to the 15-man game.\nIf  he does move across to union, Wells believes he would better off playing in the backs, at least initially. \"I'm sure he could make the step between league and  union  by being involved  in the  centre,\" said  Wells.  \"I  think England would prefer him to progress to a position  in the   back row where  they can make  use of some of  his rugby league skills within the forwards. \"The jury is out on whether he can cross that divide. \"At this club,  the balance will have to  be  struck  between the  cost of that  gamble and the option  of bringing in a ready-made replacement.\" ",

    "The brave Geraint, a  knight of Arthur's court,\nA tributary prince of  Devon, one\nOf that  great Order of  the Table Round,\nHad married Enid, Yniol's  only child,\nAnd loved her, as he loved the light of Heaven.\nAnd  as the light of Heaven varies, now\nAt sunrise, now at sunset, now by  night\nWith  moon and trembling stars, so loved Geraint\nTo make her beauty vary day by day,\nIn crimsons and  in purples and in  gems.\nAnd Enid, but to please her husband's  eye,\nWho first had  found and loved her in a state\nOf broken fortunes, daily fronted him\nIn some fresh splendour; and  the  Queen herself,\nGrateful to Prince  Geraint for  service done,\nLoved  her,  and often with her  own   white hands\nArrayed and decked her, as the loveliest,\nNext after  her own self, in all the court.\nAnd Enid loved   the Queen, and with true heart\nAdored  her,  as the stateliest and the best\nAnd loveliest of  all women upon earth.\nAnd seeing them so tender and so close,\nLong in their common love rejoiced Geraint.\nBut  when  a rumour rose  about the  Queen,\nTouching  her  guilty  love  for  Lancelot,\nThough  yet there lived no proof, nor yet was heard\nThe world's  loud whisper breaking into    storm,\nNot  less Geraint believed it; and there  fell\nA horror  on him, lest his gentle wife,\nThrough that great tenderness for Guinevere,\nHad suffered, or should suffer any taint\nIn nature:  wherefore  going to the King,\nHe made this pretext,  that  his  princedom lay\nClose on the borders of a territory,\nWherein were bandit  earls, and caitiff knights,\nAssassins, and  all flyers from  the hand\nOf Justice, and whatever loathes a  law:\nAnd therefore,  till  the King himself should please\nTo cleanse this  common sewer of all his realm,\nHe craved a fair permission to  depart,\nAnd there  defend his marches; and the King\nMused for a  little on his plea, but, last,\nAllowing it, the Prince and Enid  rode,\nAnd fifty knights rode with them,  to the shores\nOf Severn, and  they past  to their own land;\nWhere, thinking, that if ever  yet was wife\nTrue to her lord, mine shall  be  so to  me,\nHe compassed her with  sweet  observances\nAnd worship, never leaving her, and grew\nForgetful of his promise to the King,\nForgetful of the falcon and  the hunt,\nForgetful  of the  tilt and tournament,\nForgetful of  his glory and his name,\nForgetful  of his princedom and  its  cares.\nAnd   this  forgetfulness was hateful to her.\nAnd by and by  the people, when they met\nIn twos and threes, or fuller companies,\nBegan to scoff and jeer and  babble of him\nAs of  a prince whose manhood was  all gone,\nAnd molten down in mere uxoriousness.\nAnd this she gathered from the people's eyes:\nThis  too  the women who attired  her head,\nTo please   her, dwelling on  his boundless  love,\nTold Enid, and they saddened her the more:\nAnd day by day she thought to tell Geraint,\nBut could not out of bashful delicacy;\nWhile he that watched her sadden, was the more\nSuspicious  that her nature had a taint.\nAt  last, it  chanced that on a summer morn\n(They sleeping each by either) the new sun\nBeat  through the blindless casement of the  room,\nAnd heated  the strong  warrior in his  dreams;\nWho, moving,  cast  the  coverlet aside,\nAnd bared the knotted column  of his throat,\nThe  massive square of his heroic breast,\nAnd  arms on which  the standing muscle sloped,\nAs slopes a  wild brook o'er a little stone,\nRunning too vehemently to break upon it.\nAnd Enid woke and sat  beside the  couch,\nAdmiring him, and thought within herself,\nWas ever man so grandly made as he?\nThen, like a shadow, past the  people's talk\nAnd accusation of uxoriousness\nAcross  her mind, and bowing over him,\nLow to her  own heart piteously she  said:\n'O  noble  breast and all-puissant arms,\nAm I the cause, I the poor cause that men\nReproach you, saying  all your  force is gone?\nI AM the cause, because I dare not speak\nAnd  tell him what I think and what they say.\nAnd yet I hate that he   should  linger here;\nI cannot  love my lord and not his name.\nFar liefer had I gird his harness on him,\nAnd ride with him to  battle and stand by,\nAnd watch his mightful hand striking great blows\nAt caitiffs and at  wrongers of the world.\nFar better   were I laid  in the dark earth,\nNot hearing any more his noble voice,\nNot to be folded more in these dear  arms,\nAnd darkened from the  high light in his  eyes,\nThan that my lord through me  should suffer shame.\nAm I so bold,  and could I so stand by,\nAnd see my  dear lord wounded in the strife,\nAnd maybe  pierced  to death before mine eyes,\nAnd yet not dare to tell him what I  think,\nAnd  how men slur him, saying all his force\nIs  melted  into mere  effeminacy?\nO me, I fear  that I am no true wife.'\nHalf inwardly, half audibly she spoke,\nAnd the strong passion in her made her  weep\nTrue tears  upon his broad and naked breast,\nAnd these awoke him,  and  by great mischance\nHe heard but fragments of her later words,\nAnd that she feared she was not a true wife.\nAnd then he thought,   'In spite of all my care,\nFor all my pains, poor man, for all my pains,\nShe is not faithful to  me, and I see her\nWeeping for  some gay knight  in Arthur's  hall.'\nThen though he loved and reverenced her too  much\nTo dream she could be guilty of    foul act,\nRight through his   manful breast darted the pang\nThat makes a man, in the sweet face of her\nWhom he  loves most, lonely and  miserable.\nAt this he hurled his  huge limbs  out of   bed,\nAnd shook his drowsy squire awake and  cried,\n'My  charger  and her palfrey;' then to her,\n'I will ride forth into the wilderness;\nFor though  it seems  my spurs are yet to win,\nI have  not fallen so low as some would wish.\nAnd thou, put on thy worst and meanest dress\nAnd  ride  with me.'  And Enid  asked, amazed,\n'If Enid  errs, let Enid learn  her fault.'\nBut he, 'I charge  thee, ask  not, but obey.'\nThen she bethought her  of a faded  silk,\nA faded mantle and  a  faded veil,\nAnd moving  toward   a cedarn  cabinet,\nWherein she kept them folded    reverently\nWith sprigs of  summer  laid between  the folds,\nShe took them, and arrayed herself therein,\nRemembering when first he  came on her\nDrest in that dress, and how  he loved her in it,\nAnd all her foolish fears about the  dress,\nAnd  all his  journey to her, as himself\nHad told  her, and  their   coming  to the  court.\nFor Arthur on the  Whitsuntide before\nHeld court at  old Caerleon upon Usk.\nThere  on a day,  he sitting high  in hall,\nBefore him came a  forester of Dean,\nWet from the woods, with  notice of a hart\nTaller than all  his fellows, milky-white,\nFirst seen that day:  these things he told  the  King.\nThen the good King  gave order to let blow\nHis  horns for hunting on  the  morrow morn.\nAnd    when the  King  petitioned for his leave\nTo see the hunt, allowed it easily.\nSo with the morning all the court were gone.\nBut  Guinevere lay late into the morn,\nLost  in sweet dreams, and dreaming  of her love\nFor  Lancelot, and  forgetful of the hunt;\nBut rose at last, a single maiden with her,\nTook   horse, and forded Usk,  and gained  the wood;\nThere, on a   little  knoll beside it,  stayed\nWaiting to  hear the hounds; but heard  instead\nA sudden sound of hoofs, for Prince Geraint,\nLate also, wearing  neither  hunting-dress\nNor weapon, save a golden-hilted brand,\nCame quickly  flashing through  the  shallow ford\nBehind  them, and so galloped up the knoll.\nA purple scarf,  at either end whereof\nThere swung an apple of the purest gold,\nSwayed  round  about him, as he  galloped up\nTo join them, glancing like a dragon-fly\nIn summer suit and silks of holiday.\nLow bowed the tributary Prince, and she,\nSweet and statelily, and  with all grace\nOf womanhood and queenhood, answered him:\n'Late, late, Sir  Prince,' she said, 'later than we!'\n'Yea, noble Queen,' he answered, 'and so late\nThat I but come like you to see  the hunt,\nNot join it.'  'Therefore wait with me,' she said;\n'For on this  little knoll, if anywhere,\nThere is good  chance that we shall hear  the hounds:\nHere often they break covert  at our feet.'\nAnd while they listened for the distant hunt,\nAnd chiefly for the baying  of Cavall,\nKing  Arthur's hound of  deepest mouth,  there rode\nFull slowly  by a  knight, lady, and dwarf;\nWhereof the  dwarf lagged  latest, and the knight\nHad vizor up, and showed a youthful face,\nImperious,  and of haughtiest lineaments.\nAnd Guinevere,   not mindful of his  face\nIn the King's hall, desired  his  name, and sent\nHer maiden to demand it of the dwarf;\nWho being vicious, old and irritable,\nAnd   doubling all his  master's vice of pride,\nMade answer sharply that  she should not know.\n'Then will  I ask it of himself,' she said.\n'Nay,  by  my faith,  thou shalt  not,' cried the dwarf;\n'Thou  art not worthy even to speak of him;'\nAnd  when she put  her horse toward the knight,\nStruck at her with  his whip, and she returned\nIndignant to the Queen; whereat  Geraint\nExclaiming,  'Surely I  will learn the name,'\nMade sharply to  the   dwarf, and asked it of him,\nWho answered  as before;  and when the  Prince\nHad put his horse in  motion toward  the   knight,\nStruck at him with his whip, and cut his cheek.\nThe Prince's blood spirted upon the scarf,\nDyeing  it; and his quick, instinctive hand\nCaught at the hilt, as to abolish him:\nBut  he, from his exceeding manfulness\nAnd pure nobility  of temperament,\nWroth to  be wroth at such  a  worm,  refrained\nFrom even  a word, and so returning said:\n'I will avenge this insult, noble Queen,\nDone in your maiden's  person to yourself:\nAnd I will  track this vermin to their earths:\nFor though I ride unarmed, I do not  doubt\nTo find, at some place  I shall  come at, arms\nOn loan, or else for pledge; and, being found,\nThen will I fight  him, and will break his  pride,\nAnd on the third day will again be here,\nSo that I be not  fallen in fight.  Farewell.'\n'Farewell, fair  Prince,' answered the stately  Queen.\n'Be prosperous in this journey, as in all;\nAnd  may you  light  on all things that you love,\nAnd live to wed with her whom first you love:\nBut ere you wed with any, bring your bride,\nAnd I,  were  she the daughter of  a  king,\nYea, though she were  a beggar  from the hedge,\nWill clothe her for her  bridals like the sun.'\nAnd Prince  Geraint, now thinking  that  he heard\nThe   noble hart  at   bay, now the far horn,\nA   little vext at losing of the hunt,\nA  little at the vile occasion, rode,\nBy ups and downs, through many a grassy glade\nAnd valley,  with  fixt eye following the  three.\nAt  last they  issued from the world of wood,\nAnd climbed upon a fair and  even ridge,\nAnd showed themselves against the sky, and sank.\nAnd thither  there came  Geraint, and  underneath\nBeheld the  long street of  a little town\nIn a  long valley, on  one  side  whereof,\nWhite from the mason's hand, a fortress  rose;\nAnd  on one side  a castle   in decay,\nBeyond a bridge that spanned a dry ravine:\nAnd out  of  town and valley  came a noise\nAs of a broad  brook o'er a shingly bed\nBrawling, or like a clamour of the rooks\nAt distance, ere they settle  for the night.\nAnd onward to the fortress  rode  the three,\nAnd entered, and were lost behind the walls.\n'So,' thought Geraint, 'I have tracked him to his earth.'\nAnd down the long  street  riding wearily,\nFound every hostel  full, and everywhere\nWas hammer laid to  hoof, and the hot hiss\nAnd bustling whistle of the youth  who scoured\nHis  master's armour; and of such a one\nHe  asked, 'What  means the tumult in the town?'\nWho told him, scouring still, 'The  sparrow-hawk!'\nThen riding close behind an ancient churl,\nWho,  smitten by the dusty sloping beam,\nWent sweating underneath  a sack of corn,\nAsked yet once more what meant the  hubbub here?\nWho  answered gruffly, 'Ugh! the sparrow-hawk.'\nThen riding  further  past an armourer's,\nWho,  with back  turned, and bowed above his  work,\nSat riveting a helmet on his knee,\nHe put the  self-same query, but the man\nNot turning round, nor  looking at him, said:\n'Friend,  he that labours for the sparrow-hawk\nHas little time for idle questioners.'\nWhereat Geraint flashed into sudden spleen:\n'A  thousand pips eat up your sparrow-hawk!\nTits, wrens, and all winged nothings peck him dead!\nYe think the rustic cackle of your bourg\nThe murmur of  the world!   What is it to me?\nO  wretched set of sparrows, one and all,\nWho pipe of nothing but of sparrow-hawks!\nSpeak, if ye   be not like the rest, hawk-mad,\nWhere can I get me harbourage  for the night?\nAnd arms,  arms, arms to fight my  enemy?  Speak!'\nWhereat the armourer turning all  amazed\nAnd   seeing one so gay in purple  silks,\nCame forward with the helmet yet in hand\nAnd answered, 'Pardon me, O stranger knight;\nWe hold a tourney here tomorrow morn,\nAnd there is scantly time for half the work.\nArms? truth! I know not:   all  are wanted here.\nHarbourage? truth, good truth, I know not,  save,\nIt may be, at Earl Yniol's, o'er  the bridge\nYonder.'   He spoke and fell to work again.\nThen rode  Geraint,  a little  spleenful yet,\nAcross the bridge that  spanned the dry ravine.\nThere musing sat the hoary-headed  Earl,\n(His dress a suit of frayed magnificence,\nOnce fit  for feasts of ceremony)  and said:\n'Whither,  fair son?' to whom Geraint replied,\n'O friend,  I seek a harbourage for  the night.'\nThen Yniol,  'Enter  therefore and  partake\nThe slender  entertainment of a house\nOnce rich, now poor, but ever  open-doored.'\n'Thanks, venerable friend,' replied Geraint;\n'So  that ye do not  serve me sparrow-hawks\nFor  supper,  I will enter, I will  eat\nWith all the passion of a twelve hours' fast.'\nThen  sighed and smiled the  hoary-headed  Earl,\nAnd answered,  'Graver cause than yours  is  mine\nTo curse this hedgerow thief, the sparrow-hawk:\nBut in, go in; for   save yourself desire it,\nWe will  not touch upon him even in  jest.'\nThen  rode Geraint  into the  castle court,\nHis charger trampling many a  prickly  star\nOf sprouted thistle on  the broken stones.\nHe looked  and saw that all   was ruinous.\nHere  stood  a shattered  archway plumed  with  fern;\nAnd here had  fallen a great part of a tower,\nWhole, like a crag that tumbles from the  cliff,\nAnd like a crag was gay with wilding flowers:\nAnd high  above a piece of turret stair,\nWorn  by the feet that now were silent, wound\nBare to the sun, and monstrous ivy-stems\nClaspt the gray walls with  hairy-fibred arms,\nAnd  sucked  the  joining of the stones, and looked\nA knot, beneath, of snakes, aloft, a grove.\nAnd while he waited  in the castle court,\nThe voice of Enid, Yniol's daughter, rang\nClear through the open casement of the hall,\nSinging; and as the sweet voice of a bird,\nHeard by  the lander in a lonely isle,\nMoves him  to think what kind of bird it is\nThat sings so delicately  clear, and make\nConjecture of the plumage and the form;\nSo the  sweet voice of Enid  moved  Geraint;\nAnd made him like a man abroad at morn\nWhen first the  liquid note beloved  of men\nComes flying over many a windy wave\nTo Britain, and  in April  suddenly\nBreaks from a coppice gemmed with green and red,\nAnd he suspends his converse with a friend,\nOr it  may  be the labour of his hands,\nTo think or say, 'There is the nightingale;'\nSo fared it with  Geraint, who  thought and said,\n'Here, by God's grace, is  the one voice for  me.'\nIt  chanced the song   that  Enid sang was one\nOf Fortune and her wheel,  and Enid sang:\n'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel and lower  the proud;\nTurn thy wild wheel through sunshine, storm, and cloud;\nThy wheel and  thee we neither love nor hate.\n'Turn,   Fortune, turn thy wheel  with smile or frown;\nWith that wild  wheel we go  not  up  or down;\nOur hoard   is little, but our hearts are great.\n'Smile  and we smile,  the lords of  many lands;\nFrown and we smile, the lords   of our own hands;\nFor man is man and master of his fate.\n'Turn, turn thy wheel  above the staring crowd;\nThy wheel and thou are shadows  in the cloud;\nThy wheel and thee  we  neither  love nor hate.'\n'Hark, by the bird's song ye may learn the  nest,'\nSaid  Yniol; 'enter quickly.'  Entering then,\nRight o'er a mount of  newly-fallen stones,\nThe dusky-raftered many-cobwebbed hall,\nHe   found  an ancient dame in  dim brocade;\nAnd  near her, like a blossom vermeil-white,\nThat lightly  breaks a faded  flower-sheath,\nMoved the fair Enid,   all in faded  silk,\nHer daughter.   In a moment thought  Geraint,\n'Here  by God's rood is the one  maid for me.'\nBut none spake  word  except the hoary Earl:\n'Enid, the good  knight's horse stands in   the court;\nTake him  to stall, and give him corn, and then\nGo to the town and buy us flesh and wine;\nAnd we will make us merry as we may.\nOur hoard  is  little,  but our hearts are great.'\nHe spake:  the Prince, as Enid past  him, fain\nTo follow, strode a stride, but Yniol caught\nHis purple scarf, and held, and said,  'Forbear!\nRest! the good   house, though ruined, O my son,\nEndures not that her guest  should serve  himself.'\nAnd reverencing the custom of  the house\nGeraint, from utter   courtesy,  forbore.\nSo Enid took his charger to the stall;\nAnd   after went her way across the bridge,\nAnd reached  the town, and while  the Prince and Earl\nYet spoke together, came again with one,\nA youth, that following with a costrel bore\nThe means  of goodly welcome, flesh  and wine.\nAnd  Enid  brought sweet cakes to make them  cheer,\nAnd in her  veil enfolded,  manchet bread.\nAnd then, because their hall must also serve\nFor kitchen, boiled  the flesh,   and spread the board,\nAnd stood behind, and waited on the three.\nAnd seeing  her so sweet and serviceable,\nGeraint had longing  in him evermore\nTo  stoop and kiss  the tender little thumb,\nThat crost the trencher as she laid  it down:\nBut  after all had eaten, then Geraint,\nFor now the wine made summer in his veins,\nLet his eye  rove  in following, or  rest\nOn Enid at  her lowly handmaid-work,\nNow here, now there,  about  the dusky  hall;\nThen suddenly addrest the hoary  Earl:\n'Fair Host and Earl, I pray your courtesy;\nThis  sparrow-hawk,  what  is he? tell me of him.\nHis name? but  no, good faith, I will not have it:\nFor  if he  be  the  knight  whom  late I saw\nRide into that new fortress by  your  town,\nWhite from the  mason's  hand,  then have I  sworn\nFrom his own lips to have   it--I am Geraint\nOf Devon--for   this morning when the Queen\nSent her own maiden  to  demand  the name,\nHis dwarf, a vicious under-shapen thing,\nStruck at her with his whip, and she returned\nIndignant to the Queen; and then  I swore\nThat I  would track this caitiff to his hold,\nAnd fight and  break his pride, and have it of him.\nAnd all unarmed I rode, and thought  to find\nArms in your  town, where all  the  men are mad;\nThey take the rustic murmur of their bourg\nFor the great  wave that echoes round the world;\nThey  would not hear me speak:  but if ye  know\nWhere I can light  on arms, or  if  yourself\nShould have them, tell me, seeing I have sworn\nThat  I  will break his pride and learn his name,\nAvenging this great insult done the Queen.'\nThen cried Earl Yniol, 'Art  thou  he indeed,\nGeraint, a name far-sounded among men\nFor noble deeds?  and truly I, when first\nI saw you moving by  me  on the bridge,\nFelt  ye were somewhat, yea, and by your state\nAnd presence might have guessed you one of those\nThat eat in Arthur's hall in Camelot.\nNor speak I now from foolish flattery;\nFor this dear  child hath often heard me  praise\nYour feats of arms, and often when I paused\nHath  asked again, and ever loved to   hear;\nSo grateful is the noise  of noble deeds\nTo noble hearts who see but acts  of wrong:\nO never yet had woman   such a pair\nOf suitors as this maiden:    first  Limours,\nA creature wholly  given to brawls and wine,\nDrunk even when  he  wooed; and be he dead\nI   know not, but   he past to the wild land.\nThe second was your foe, the sparrow-hawk,\nMy  curse, my nephew--I will not let his name\nSlip from my lips if I can help it--he,\nWhen that  I knew   him fierce and turbulent\nRefused her to him, then his pride  awoke;\nAnd since the proud man often  is  the mean,\nHe sowed a slander in   the common ear,\nAffirming  that his father left him gold,\nAnd in my  charge,  which  was  not rendered to  him;\nBribed with large promises the men who served\nAbout my person,   the more  easily\nBecause my means  were somewhat broken  into\nThrough open  doors and hospitality;\nRaised my  own town against me in the night\nBefore my Enid's  birthday, sacked my house;\nFrom mine  own earldom  foully  ousted me;\nBuilt  that new fort to overawe  my friends,\nFor truly   there are those who love  me yet;\nAnd keeps me in this ruinous castle here,\nWhere doubtless  he would put me  soon to death,\nBut  that his  pride too much despises me:\nAnd I myself   sometimes despise myself;\nFor  I have let men be, and have their way;\nAm much too gentle, have not used  my power:\nNor  know I whether I be very  base\nOr very manful,  whether very wise\nOr very foolish; only this I know,\nThat whatsoever evil happen to me,\nI seem to  suffer nothing heart or limb,\nBut can endure it all  most patiently.'\n'Well said, true  heart,' replied Geraint,  'but   arms,\nThat if the sparrow-hawk, this nephew, fight\nIn next day's tourney  I may break his pride.'\nAnd Yniol answered, 'Arms, indeed, but old\nAnd rusty, old  and rusty, Prince Geraint,\nAre mine, and therefore at thy asking, thine.\nBut in this tournament  can no  man tilt,\nExcept the lady he  loves best be there.\nTwo forks are fixt into the meadow ground,\nAnd  over these is placed a silver wand,\nAnd over that a golden sparrow-hawk,\nThe  prize  of beauty for the fairest there.\nAnd this, what knight soever be in field\nLays claim to for the lady at his side,\nAnd   tilts   with my good nephew thereupon,\nWho being apt at arms and big  of  bone\nHas ever won it for the lady with  him,\nAnd toppling over   all  antagonism\nHas earned himself the name of sparrow-hawk.'\nBut  thou,  that hast no lady, canst not fight.'\nTo whom Geraint with  eyes all bright replied,\nLeaning a little   toward him, 'Thy leave!\nLet ME lay  lance in rest, O noble   host,\nFor this  dear child, because I  never  saw,\nThough having seen all beauties of  our time,\nNor can see elsewhere,  anything so fair.\nAnd if I fall her name will yet  remain\nUntarnished as before; but if  I live,\nSo aid  me Heaven when at mine  uttermost,\nAs I will make  her truly my true  wife.'\nThen, howsoever patient, Yniol's   heart\nDanced in his bosom, seeing better days,\nAnd looking round he  saw not Enid there,\n(Who hearing her own name had stolen   away)\nBut  that   old  dame,  to whom full  tenderly\nAnd folding all her hand  in his he said,\n'Mother,  a maiden is a tender  thing,\nAnd best by her  that  bore her understood.\nGo thou to  rest, but ere thou go to rest\nTell her, and prove   her heart toward the Prince.'\nSo spake the kindly-hearted Earl, and she\nWith frequent smile and nod departing found,\nHalf disarrayed as to her  rest,  the girl;\nWhom  first she  kissed on either cheek, and then\nOn  either  shining shoulder laid a hand,\nAnd kept   her off and  gazed upon her  face,\nAnd told them all their converse in the hall,\nProving her heart:  but  never light and shade\nCoursed one another more on open ground\nBeneath a troubled  heaven,  than  red and pale\nAcross the face of Enid hearing her;\nWhile slowly falling as a scale    that falls,\nWhen weight is added only grain by grain,\nSank  her sweet head upon her gentle breast;\nNor did she lift an eye nor speak   a word,\nRapt in the fear  and in the wonder of it;\nSo moving  without answer to her  rest\nShe  found no  rest, and  ever failed to draw\nThe quiet night into her blood, but lay\nContemplating her own  unworthiness;\nAnd   when the pale  and bloodless east  began\nTo quicken to the sun,   arose,  and raised\nHer mother too, and hand in hand they moved\nDown to the meadow  where the jousts were   held,\nAnd waited there for Yniol and Geraint.\nAnd thither came the twain, and  when  Geraint\nBeheld her first in field, awaiting  him,\nHe felt, were she the prize of bodily force,\nHimself beyond the rest pushing could move\nThe chair of Idris.   Yniol's rusted arms\nWere on  his princely person, but through   these\nPrincelike his bearing shone; and errant knights\nAnd ladies came, and by  and by the town\nFlowed in, and   settling  circled all the lists.\nAnd there they fixt  the forks into the  ground,\nAnd over  these they  placed the silver  wand,\nAnd over  that the golden sparrow-hawk.\nThen Yniol's  nephew, after trumpet blown,\nSpake to the   lady with him and proclaimed,\n'Advance and take, as fairest of the  fair,\nWhat I these two years  past have won for thee,\nThe prize of  beauty.'  Loudly  spake  the  Prince,\n'Forbear:    there is a worthier,' and the knight\nWith some surprise and thrice as  much disdain\nTurned, and beheld the four, and all  his face\nGlowed like the heart of a great fire at Yule,\nSo burnt he was with passion, crying out,\n'Do battle for it then,' no more;  and thrice\nThey clashed together, and thrice they brake  their spears.\nThen each, dishorsed and drawing, lashed at each\nSo  often and with  such blows,  that all the crowd\nWondered, and  now and then  from distant walls\nThere  came a clapping as of  phantom hands.\nSo twice  they fought, and twice they breathed, and still\nThe  dew of their great labour, and the blood\nOf  their strong bodies,  flowing, drained their  force.\nBut either's force was  matched till  Yniol's  cry,\n'Remember that great insult done the  Queen,'\nIncreased Geraint's, who heaved his blade aloft,\nAnd cracked  the helmet through, and bit the bone,\nAnd felled  him, and  set   foot upon his breast,\nAnd said, 'Thy name?'  To whom the fallen  man\nMade  answer,  groaning, 'Edyrn, son of  Nudd!\nAshamed am I that I should tell it thee.\nMy pride  is broken:  men have seen my fall.'\n'Then, Edyrn, son of Nudd,' replied Geraint,\n'These two things shalt thou do, or else thou diest.\nFirst, thou thyself,  with damsel and with dwarf,\nShalt ride  to  Arthur's court, and  coming there,\nCrave pardon  for that  insult done  the Queen,\nAnd shalt  abide her  judgment on it; next,\nThou shalt give back their earldom to thy kin.\nThese two things shalt thou do, or thou shalt die.'\nAnd Edyrn answered,   'These things will I  do,\nFor  I  have never  yet been overthrown,\nAnd  thou  hast overthrown me,  and my pride\nIs broken  down, for Enid sees  my fall!'\nAnd rising up, he rode to Arthur's   court,\nAnd there the Queen forgave him easily.\nAnd being  young, he changed and came to loathe\nHis crime of traitor, slowly drew  himself\nBright from his old dark life,  and fell  at last\nIn the great battle  fighting for the  King.\nBut when the  third day  from the hunting-morn\nMade a low splendour  in the world, and wings\nMoved in her ivy, Enid, for   she lay\nWith her fair  head in the dim-yellow light,\nAmong the dancing  shadows of the birds,\nWoke and bethought her of her promise  given\nNo  later than last eve to Prince Geraint--\nSo bent  he seemed on going  the third day,\nHe would   not   leave her,   till  her promise given--\nTo ride with  him this morning to the court,\nAnd there be made known to  the stately Queen,\nAnd there be wedded with all ceremony.\nAt  this she cast her eyes  upon her dress,\nAnd thought it never yet had looked so mean.\nFor  as a leaf in  mid-November  is\nTo  what it is in mid-October,  seemed\nThe dress that now she looked on  to the dress\nShe looked  on ere  the coming of Geraint.\nAnd still she  looked, and still the terror  grew\nOf that strange bright and dreadful thing, a court,\nAll staring at her  in her faded silk:\nAnd softly  to her own sweet heart she said:\n'This noble  prince who won our earldom  back,\nSo splendid in  his acts and  his attire,\nSweet heaven, how much I shall discredit him!\nWould he could tarry with us here  awhile,\nBut being so beholden to  the Prince,\nIt were but little grace in any of us,\nBent as he seemed on going this  third day,\nTo seek a  second favour at his  hands.\nYet  if he could but tarry a day or two,\nMyself would work eye dim, and finger lame,\nFar liefer than so much  discredit him.'\nAnd Enid  fell in  longing for a dress\nAll    branched and flowered with gold, a  costly  gift\nOf her good  mother, given her on the night\nBefore her birthday, three sad years ago,\nThat night  of fire, when Edyrn  sacked their house,\nAnd  scattered all they had to all   the winds:\nFor   while  the  mother  showed it, and the two\nWere turning and admiring it,  the work\nTo  both  appeared so  costly,  rose  a cry\nThat Edyrn's men were on  them, and they fled\nWith little  save  the jewels they  had on,\nWhich being sold and sold had bought them bread:\nAnd  Edyrn's  men had caught them in their  flight,\nAnd placed them in this ruin; and  she  wished\nThe Prince  had found  her in her ancient home;\nThen let her fancy flit across the past,\nAnd roam the goodly places that she knew;\nAnd last bethought her how  she used to watch,\nNear that old home,  a pool of golden carp;\nAnd one was  patched and blurred and lustreless\nAmong his  burnished brethren of the   pool;\nAnd half asleep she made comparison\nOf that and these to her own faded self\nAnd the  gay court, and fell asleep again;\nAnd dreamt herself was such  a faded form\nAmong her burnished sisters of the pool;\nBut this was  in the garden  of  a king;\nAnd though she lay dark in the pool, she  knew\nThat all was bright; that all   about were birds\nOf sunny plume in gilded trellis-work;\nThat all  the turf was rich in  plots  that looked\nEach like a garnet or a turkis in it;\nAnd lords and ladies of the high court went\nIn silver tissue talking things of state;\nAnd children of the King in cloth of gold\nGlanced at the doors or  gamboled down the walks;\nAnd while she thought 'They  will not see me,'    came\nA stately   queen  whose name  was Guinevere,\nAnd all the  children  in  their cloth of gold\nRan to  her, crying, 'If  we have fish  at all\nLet them be gold; and charge the gardeners now\nTo pick the faded creature  from the pool,\nAnd cast it on  the mixen that  it die.'\nAnd therewithal one came and seized on her,\nAnd Enid started waking, with  her heart\nAll overshadowed by  the foolish dream,\nAnd lo! it was  her mother grasping her\nTo get   her well awake; and  in her  hand\nA suit of  bright apparel, which she laid\nFlat on the couch,  and spoke exultingly:\n'See here, my child, how fresh the colours look,\nHow fast  they  hold like colours of a shell\nThat  keeps  the wear and  polish of the wave.\nWhy not?   It  never yet was  worn,  I trow:\nLook on it,  child, and tell me if ye know it.'\nAnd Enid looked, but all  confused at first,\nCould  scarce divide  it from her foolish dream:\nThen suddenly she knew it and rejoiced,\nAnd answered, 'Yea, I know it; your good gift,\nSo sadly  lost   on that unhappy night;\nYour own good gift!'  'Yea, surely,' said the dame,\n'And gladly given  again this happy morn.\nFor when the jousts  were ended  yesterday,\nWent  Yniol through the town, and everywhere\nHe found the sack and plunder of  our house\nAll scattered through  the houses of the town;\nAnd gave command that  all which once was ours\nShould now be ours again:  and yester-eve,\nWhile ye were talking  sweetly with your Prince,\nCame one with this and laid it in my hand,\nFor love or fear,  or  seeking  favour of us,\nBecause we  have our  earldom  back again.\nAnd  yester-eve I would not  tell you of it,\nBut kept it for a sweet surprise at morn.\nYea, truly is it not a sweet surprise?\nFor I myself unwillingly have  worn\nMy faded suit, as you,  my child, have yours,\nAnd howsoever patient, Yniol his.\nAh, dear, he took  me from a goodly house,\nWith store of  rich   apparel, sumptuous fare,\nAnd page, and maid, and squire, and seneschal,\nAnd pastime both of hawk and hound, and all\nThat appertains to noble maintenance.\nYea, and he brought  me to a goodly  house;\nBut  since  our fortune swerved from sun to shade,\nAnd  all through  that  young traitor, cruel need\nConstrained us, but  a better time has come;\nSo clothe yourself in this, that better    fits\nOur mended  fortunes and a Prince's bride:\nFor though ye  won the prize of  fairest  fair,\nAnd though I heard him  call you fairest fair,\nLet never  maiden think, however  fair,\nShe is not fairer in new clothes than  old.\nAnd should some great court-lady  say, the Prince\nHath picked  a ragged-robin from the hedge,\nAnd  like a madman brought  her to the court,\nThen were ye shamed, and, worse, might shame the Prince\nTo   whom we are beholden; but I know,\nThat when my dear  child is set forth at her best,\nThat  neither  court nor  country, though  they sought\nThrough all the provinces like those of old\nThat lighted on Queen Esther, has her match.'\nHere ceased the  kindly mother out of  breath;\nAnd Enid listened brightening  as she lay;\nThen,  as  the white  and glittering star of morn\nParts from a bank of snow, and  by and  by\nSlips into  golden cloud, the maiden  rose,\nAnd left her maiden couch, and  robed herself,\nHelped by the mother's   careful hand and eye,\nWithout a  mirror, in  the  gorgeous gown;\nWho, after, turned her daughter round, and said,\nShe never yet had seen her half so fair;\nAnd called her like that maiden in the tale,\nWhom Gwydion made by glamour out of flowers\nAnd sweeter  than the bride of Cassivelaun,\nFlur, for whose love the Roman   Csar first\nInvaded Britain, 'But we  beat him  back,\nAs this  great Prince invaded us, and we,\nNot beat him back, but welcomed him with joy\nAnd I can scarcely ride with you to court,\nFor old am I, and rough the ways and wild;\nBut Yniol goes, and I full oft shall dream\nI see my princess as I see her  now,\nClothed with my  gift, and gay  among the gay.'\nBut while the  women thus rejoiced, Geraint\nWoke  where he slept  in the high hall,  and called\nFor Enid, and when Yniol  made report\nOf that good mother making Enid gay\nIn such  apparel as  might well beseem\nHis princess,  or indeed the stately Queen,\nHe  answered:  'Earl,  entreat her by my love,\nAlbeit  I give no reason  but my  wish,\nThat she ride with me in her faded silk.'\nYniol with  that hard message went; it  fell\nLike flaws in summer laying lusty corn:\nFor Enid, all abashed she knew not why,\nDared not to glance at  her  good  mother's face,\nBut  silently, in all   obedience,\nHer  mother silent too, nor helping her,\nLaid  from her limbs  the costly-broidered gift,\nAnd robed them in her ancient suit  again,\nAnd  so descended.  Never man  rejoiced\nMore than Geraint  to greet her thus attired;\nAnd glancing  all  at once as keenly at her\nAs  careful  robins eye the delver's   toil,\nMade her cheek burn and  either eyelid fall,\nBut  rested with her sweet face   satisfied;\nThen seeing cloud upon the mother's brow,\nHer by  both hands she caught, and sweetly  said,\n'O my new mother, be not wroth or grieved\nAt thy new  son, for my petition to her.\nWhen late I  left Caerleon, our great Queen,\nIn words whose echo lasts, they were so sweet,\nMade promise, that whatever  bride  I brought,\nHerself would clothe her like   the sun in Heaven.\nThereafter, when I reached this ruined   hall,\nBeholding  one so  bright in dark estate,\nI  vowed that could I gain her, our fair Queen,\nNo hand but hers, should make your Enid  burst\nSunlike from cloud--and likewise thought perhaps,\nThat service done so  graciously would bind\nThe two  together; fain I would  the two\nShould love each other:  how can Enid find\nA  nobler friend?   Another thought was  mine;\nI came among you here so suddenly,\nThat though her  gentle  presence at the  lists\nMight well have served   for proof  that  I was loved,\nI doubted whether daughter's tenderness,\nOr easy nature, might not let itself\nBe   moulded by your wishes for her weal;\nOr whether some false sense  in her own self\nOf my contrasting brightness, overbore\nHer   fancy dwelling in  this  dusky hall;\nAnd such a  sense might make her  long  for court\nAnd all its perilous glories:    and I  thought,\nThat could I someway  prove  such force in her\nLinked with   such love  for  me, that at a word\n(No reason given her) she could cast  aside\nA splendour dear  to women, new  to her,\nAnd therefore dearer; or if not  so new,\nYet therefore tenfold dearer by the  power\nOf intermitted usage; then I felt\nThat  I could  rest, a  rock in ebbs  and flows,\nFixt on  her faith.  Now, therefore, I  do  rest,\nA prophet certain of  my prophecy,\nThat never shadow of mistrust  can  cross\nBetween us.   Grant me pardon for my thoughts:\nAnd for my strange petition  I   will make\nAmends hereafter by  some gaudy-day,\nWhen your  fair  child shall  wear your costly gift\nBeside your own warm hearth, with, on  her knees,\nWho knows? another gift of the high God,\nWhich,  maybe, shall have  learned to lisp you thanks.'\nHe spoke:  the mother smiled, but half in tears,\nThen brought a mantle down and wrapt her in it,\nAnd claspt and kissed her, and they rode away.\nNow  thrice that  morning Guinevere  had  climbed\nThe giant tower,  from whose high crest, they say,\nMen saw the goodly hills of Somerset,\nAnd  white  sails flying  on the yellow sea;\nBut  not to goodly hill or  yellow sea\nLooked the  fair Queen, but up the vale of    Usk,\nBy the flat meadow,  till she saw them come;\nAnd then  descending met them at the gates,\nEmbraced her with all welcome as a friend,\nAnd  did her honour as the Prince's  bride,\nAnd clothed her for her bridals like the sun;\nAnd all that week was  old  Caerleon gay,\nFor by the hands of Dubric, the high  saint,\nThey twain were  wedded with all ceremony.\nAnd  this was on the last year's Whitsuntide.\nBut Enid  ever kept the faded silk,\nRemembering how first he came on her,\nDrest in that dress, and   how he loved  her  in it,\nAnd all  her foolish fears about the  dress,\nAnd all his journey toward her, as himself\nHad told  her,  and their  coming to the court.\nAnd now this morning when  he said to her,\n'Put on your worst and meanest dress,'  she found\nAnd took it, and arrayed  herself therein.",

    "When I got married I  had a rubber lizzard that I had for a number of  years. The lizzard looked and felt real. So I said,  Tonight I'm  gonna have a little fun with my  honey bun.\nI  slipped in bed and  put  the lizzard under the  covers on her side of  the bed. When I lay  there in  wait for the fun to  begin.\nShe came  in and hopped in beside  me and landed  on that lizzard.\nShe let out the awfulest blood  curdling scream I ever heard.Then she started to cry.

    "When I was a little  kid about  7 or 8 years  old  there was this girl. She was a lot older then me. She  took  care of me when my foster mother and father had a break. She was really  caring and  polite. I was really   fussy but she  got  me what ever I needed. She showed me there is good  out   there. So I tried  being like her. There was one time she let me steer her  car, she still  had control of the gas and  the brake, I  thought it was the coolest thing.  When  I grew   up I noticed when you had no control over  anything, you can have  control for just a little at a time. You start to know your mistakes. When I was steering that car I was swerving, but I had  her to correct my mistakes.  Her correcting  them for  me while I was  by  her side, I learned  it a  lot faster  then I would of on  my own. Now we  aren't that close to each other, and I  started to forget what she taught me  that one day. I  didn't like how I was treating other   people and I thought about stuff to be a better person.  I thought and thought about it and I remembered what  she did for me.  I was changing a little at  a time. There was a lot  more then what  I   wrote in  this  story. I don't know how to thank her,  maybe this story will do more than I think. Thank You for  being my hero.",

    "'Twas Christmastide in  Germany,\nAnd  in the year of  1850,\nAnd in the city of Berlin, which  is most beautiful to the eye;\nA poor  boy was  heard calling out to passers-by.\n\"Who'll buy my pretty  figures,\" loudly he did cry,\nPlaster of Paris figures, but no  one inclined to  buy;\nHis  clothes were thin  and he   was nearly frozen with cold,\nAnd wholly starving with hunger, a  pitiful sight to behold.\nAnd  the twilight was giving place to the shadows of approaching night,\nAnd  those who possessed a home were  seeking its warmth and light;\nAnd the market square was dark and he began to moan,\nWhen he  thought of his hungry brother  and sisters at home.\nAlas!

He fell on the  pavement, oh! horror and dismay.\nAnd his beautiful figures were  broken and scattered around him,\nAnd at the sight thereof his eyes grew dim;\nAnd   when he regained his feet he stood speechless like  one  bowed down,\nThen the poor boy did   fret and frown.\nThen the almost despairing boy cried aloud,\nAnd  related his distress to the increasing crowd;\nOh! What a pitiful  sight on a Christmas eve,\nBut the dense crowd didn't  the   poor boy relieve,\nUntil a poor wood-cutter chanced  to come along,\nAnd he  asked of the crowd what  was wrong;\nAnd twenty ready tongues tells him the sad tale,\nAnd when he heard it   the poor boy's fate he did bewail.\nAnd he cried, \"Here! Something  must be  done and quickly  too,\nDo you hear! Every blessed soul of you;\nCome, each one give a  few pence to the poor boy,\nAnd it will  help to fill his heart with  joy.\"\nThen the wood-cutter gave a golden  coin away,\nSo the  crowd  subscribed largely without delay;\nWhich  made the poor boy's heart feel  gay,\nThen the wood-cutter  thanked the crowd and went away.\nSo  the poor boy did a  large subscription receive,\nAnd his brother, mother, and sisters had a happy Christmas eve;\nAnd he thanked the  crowd  and God that to him the money sent,\nAnd bade the crowd good-night,  then went home content.

Line a  baking  sheet with parchment. Break off and discard woody ends of asparagus and place asparagus on  the baking sheet. Drizzle on 1 tablespoon of   the oil, add salt and  pepper to taste and toss together  with your hands until asparagus is thoroughly coated with oil. Place in  oven and roast 12  minutes, or until tender and lightly browned in spots, turning asparagus halfway through. Remove asparagus  from the oven and allow to cool until  you can  handle it. Slice into 1/2  to 3/4-inch  pieces and  place in  a medium  bowl. Turn  oven    down to 350 degrees. Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat and add scallions. Cook, stirring, until tender,  about  5 minutes. Season to  taste with salt  and pepper. Remove from heat. Transfer to bowl with   asparagus.  Add tarragon and  parsley and toss together. Beat together egg yolks and eggs in a medium bowl. Set tart pan  on a baking sheet to  allow for easy handling. Using  a pastry brush, lightly brush the bottom of the  crust with some of the beaten egg and place  in oven for 5  minutes.  Add salt (I use  1/2 teaspoon), pepper, and milk  to remaining eggs  and whisk  together.  Spread  scallion and asparagus mixture in an even layer in the crust. Stir together cheeses and sprinkle evenly on top. Very slowly  pour  in  egg  custard  over the   filling. If your tart pan  has low  edges, you may not need all of it to fill the  shell, and you  want to keep the  custard from spilling  over. Place  quiche, on baking sheet, in the oven and bake for 30 to  35 minutes, until set   and just beginning to color on  the top. Remove from oven and  allow to sit for at least 10 minutes before serving.  Serve hot, warm or room temperature. ",

Either   change to a  doughhook and  knead for 2  minutes  or knead the dough on a work surface  by hand for 10  minutes. If you use a machine,  knead the dough by hand for  a final half minute (the warmth of your hands finishes  it  off  perfectly). You will now have a smooth firm dough. Wrap it in cling film and allow to rest in the fridge  for at least half an hour. Bring a large  pan of water  to  the  boil and salt the water generously. Feed the pasta dough  through the  pasta machine on its lowest  setting. Fold the  dough and repeat 3 more times. Increasing the  setting by  one mark each time, feed  the dough through the machine once  until you reach its highest setting (if you are as short of kitchen space  as I  am you'll want to  cut your rolled pasta in half part  way through  the  rolling to make it more manageable, so you end  up with 2 sheets of pasta). Pass  them through the  tagliatelle cutter and mix the pasta strands with the polenta until  your  are ready to cook it.   Boil the pasta for no more than  3  minutes and while it  is cooking  heat the butter in large pan and add  the garlic leaves, salt and pepper.  Cook  for one minute then take off the heat.   Add the drained pasta. Mix in a tablespoon or so of cooking water to loosen slightly. Serve with lots of  grated parmesan.",

To prepare  the roast pork, cut the meat into slices 1 1/2 inches thick. Then cut across the  slices  every 1 to 1/2 inches to make  long   strips. Place   the  meat  in  a   rectangular glass pan or stainless steel pan  that will hold it  in one layer. Set the meat aside while preparing  the marinade. To prepare  the marinade, in   a small bowl combine all remaining  ingredients and stir well  to mix. Pour over  the meat and stir the meat around in the marinade so that all  the meat is  well moistened with it. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let the meat   marinate for 3 to 6 hours at a cool  room  temperature or  in the refrigerator. To roast the pork, set a   rack in the middle  level  of the oven  and preheat to 375 degrees. Pour about 1 inch of warm water into the roasting pan  and balance the  rack on top of  the roasting pan. Lift  the  pieces of pork from the marinade and  arrange them on the rack. Roast the  pork for about 1  hour, basting 2 to 3 times with the remaining marinade and turning the pieces several times. Remove the pan  from  the  oven  and place  the rack over a jelly-roll pan. Cool the pork to room temperature. If you are roasting  the pork in advance, refrigerate it in plastic wrap before continuing. Cold pork is easier to dice. To prepare the filling, heat the oil in  a  large saute  pan or wok  and add the onion. Cook over low to medium  heat for about 5  minutes,  or  until the onion is softened. Stir in the diced pork and chicken stock and simmer 1 minute. Add all  the remaining  ingredients except the scallions and dissolved cornstarch and stir well to mix. Push  the  filling aside to expose some  of the pan bottom and add the cornstarch  mixture. Stir constantly until it  thickens slightly, then stir the thickened cornstarch evenly into  the  filling. Cook,  stirring, 1 minute longer, then stir in the scallions. Scrape the  filling into a glass or stainless steel  bowl and cool it  to room temperature. For  advance preparation, cover the bowl with   plastic wrap and refrigerate it for up to a day  before continuing.  To prepare the dough, in  a small saucepan over low heat.  heat the milk until it  is lukewarm (about 110 degrees).  Remove the pan from the heat and pour the milk into a  medium bowl. Whisk in the yeast, followed by the butter. Whisk  in the egg with the  sugar and salt. Place the flour  in  the bowl of a food processor fitted with  the steel blade. Add the yeast and egg  mixture, scraping it in with a rubber  spatula. pulse until the dough   forms a very soft ball. Let the processor run continuously for 10   seconds to  knead  the dough. Invert the dough  into a  buttered bowl and  carefully remove the blade. Turn the  dough over so that the top is  buttered,  and cover the bowl with plastic  wrap. Let the dough rise  at room temperature until it has doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. To form the buns, scrape the dough  onto a floured work surface and use a bench scraper or knife to  cut   it in  half. Roll each piece of dough under the palms of your hands to an 8-inch cylinder. Cut  each cylinder of  dough into eight 1-inch pieces. Place one of  the pieces  of dough on a lightly  floured  work surface  and press and roll it to a 3-inch disk. Place a  heaping tablespoon  of the filling in the  center and draw the sides of the disk of  dough up  all around the filling to meet in the center, enclosing  the filling. Firmly pinch  the seam closed and invert the bun,    seam side  down, onto one of the prepared pans. Repeat with  the remaining  dough and  filling. Cover the buns  with oiled plastic wrap or a towel and  let  them rise at room temperature until  they almost  double in bulk, about 30  minutes. About  15 minutes  before the buns are completely risen, set racks in the  upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat  to 350 degrees. Immediately  before baking the buns, carefully brush them with the egg wash.  Bake the buns until    they are a deep golden color, about 20 to 25 minutes. Switch the pan   from  the upper  rack to the  lower  one, and the  pan from the lower rack to the  upper one, about midway through the   baking. Cool  the  buns on a rack. ",

In a heavy   2 1/2- to 3-quart saucepan,  combine the granulated and  brown sugars, then add the cream, butter and   salt. Set over very low heat and cook, stirring frequently with   a wooden spoon, until the sugar is dissolved, 10 to 15 minutes. As the mixture cooks, use a  pastry brush dipped  in cold water to wash down any sugar crystals that form  on the inside of the pan. Clamp   a candy  thermometer onto  the side of the pan  and increase  the heat to medium-high. Boil the syrup, undisturbed, until it  registers  236F and a teaspoon of syrup dropped into a small  bowl of cold water holds a  very soft  ball when pressed  between your  fingers, 3 to 6 minutes. Remove the pan  from  the heat, leaving the thermometer in place, and let  cool,  undisturbed, until the syrup registers 220F, 1 to 3 minutes.  Using  a clean, dry wooden spoon, stir  in the baking soda and  vanilla  until well combined; the mixture will become lighter in color and foamy in texture. Then stir in the pecan halves. Working quickly, drop the candy by heaping tablespoonfuls onto the  prepared baking sheet. Let stand  at room temperature  until firm, about  1  hour.

Cut 2 or 3 slits into whole eggplant.  Place eggplant  directly on the  oven rack in the   middle of the oven and roast the eggplant until it is tender,  about 20 minutes.  Keep the slits facing up so that the eggplant does not loose  liquids as it roasts. The roasted eggplant will  look like a  flat tire when you remove it from the oven. Using a sharp  utility   knife, carefully  peel skin away  from  eggplant flesh.  Add cooked  eggplant flesh and juice to  food processor  and  combine with  garlic,    allspice, salt, and pepper and parsley. Pulse grind the eggplant into a paste, add a drizzle of  olive oil. Transfer to a serving   dish.  The seeds of the eggplant will make the spread resemble caviar eggs, and so the  name:  poor man's caviar. To serve, surround a bowlful of spread with crusty bread  rounds. Tidbit: Mixed olives and selections of Italian sheep's milk  cheeses are suggested accompaniments  to  this   menu to round out   your buffet.

    "1 1/4 cups sugar\n1/2 cup water\n1/4  teaspoon cream of tartar\n1 cup green pumpkin seeds\nCover a baking sheet with  a piece of Silpat or other re-usable parchment,  or tear  off some aluminum foil  and lightly  oil it. Dissolve the sugar, water and cream of tartar in a  saucepan  over a low heat. Turn  the heat up  and bring the mixture to  a boil but do not stir. Let  the  syrup bubble over a fairly  high heat for about  10 minutes   until it turns a deep  golden amber color. Dont be tempted  to wander  away, make a phone call or leave the pan unattended, as the syrup could caramelize sooner. There are various factors at play here, and I know nothing of the dimensions of your pans  or what materials  theyre made  of and thats not the whole story  either. Quickly  tip  the pumpkin seeds into the amber-colored syrup, swirl the pan so  that  they become evenly  coated  and  then take off the heat. Pour the  syrup immediately on to  the Bake-O-Glide or oiled-foil-lined tray,  trying to  spread the  molten liquid  in a thin layer. It is  possible  to spread  the  brittle with a palette  knife if  it has mounded  too much,  but move fast: you will have only a short  time to do this before it begins to  set. Leave the brittle to cool and harden completely before breaking it into pieces. I rather like to leave it  as  it is, a wibbly-wobbly outlined disc of green-studded amber, and quite, quite  beautiful, bashing it into sharp pieces at the table. ",

    "3 pounds boned Icelandic lamb loins (about 3  ounces each) and tenderloins (1 to 2 ounces  each); see note\n1 bottle pinot noir or other full-bodied red wine\n1   medium carrot, trimmed, peeled  and chopped coarsely\n1  medium onion, peeled and chopped  coarsely\n1  celery rib, trimmed and chopped  coarsely\n2 cloves garlic, peeled and  crushed\n1 6 1/2-ounce container D'Artagnan Rich Duck and Veal Stock\nDemi-Glace (see note)\n2  large sprigs fresh rosemary\n2 tablespoons peanut or corn  oil\nSalt  and freshly ground  black pepper to  taste\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter\nOne  hour before you are  ready to   cook the lamb, remove it from the refrigerator.  Meanwhile, in a 3-quart  nonreactive shallow saucepan, bring the wine to  a boil.  With a long match, ignite  the wine  and boil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the  flame subsides and the alcohol evaporates. Add the carrot, onion, celery and garlic;  cook at a low boil for about 10   minutes, or until reduced  by half. Add   the demi-glace and simmer about 15 minutes, or  until reduced  by half. Remove the pan from the heat;  add the rosemary to steep and set aside. Preheat the oven to  500 degrees. Heat a large skillet (preferably  cast iron) over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of  the oil. When the oil begins  to  shimmer, add about  half the loins and brown about 1 minute on each side. (Do not overcrowd the meat.) Season with  salt and pepper  and set aside. Repeat with the remaining loins. Return all the loins to the skillet and transfer it to the oven.  Roast the  loins  for 4 to  5 minutes, or until the meat is firm to the  touch and an instant-read thermometer in the  thickest  part registers  120 degrees. Transfer the loins  to a platter, cover loosely with  foil and let stand 5  minutes. (The temperature will reach 125 to  130 degrees for medium rare.)  Wipe out  the skillet. Brown the tenderloins  in batches  with the remaining tablespoon of oil  for 1 to 1 1/2    minutes per side for medium rare. Add any juices from the meat to the  reserved  sauce. Strain  it into a bowl through a fine sieve,  pressing the vegetables with the  back  of a spoon to extract as  much  liquid as  possible.  Wipe out the saucepan, add the strained sauce and  return to a simmer. Whisk in the butter until melted. Remove from the heat and season with salt  and pepper. (Makes  about 1 cup.) Slice  the  loins on  the bias and the  tenderloins into  thirds.  Divide among 6 plates, nap with sauce and  serve with Roasted  Tomatoes and Summer Peas (see recipes). ",
    "1 as much (to taste) Crabmeat (canned is fine)\n60 grams  Flour\n60  grams Butter\n1000 ml Milk\n1 tbsp Parmesan   cheese\n1 dash Pepper\n1 dash less than 1/2 teaspoon Soup   stock  granules\n50 ml White wine\n2 Egg yolks\n2 Egg whites\n100 grams Flour\n100  ml Water\n1 Panko\nTake the crabmeat  out  of  the shell  and shred it. Add the butter to a  frying pan  and melt it over  medium heat.  When it's melted and foamy, add the flour  little by little in  4 to 5 portions,  stirring well  between additions.  Mix  the  butter  and flour well with a wooden spatula so that they  blend  together. Be careful not to  let  it burn. Add  the  milk, again little by little, mixing  well  to    incorporate it with the roux between additions. When all the milk has been added, the sauce should be thick like this. It should stiffen when cooled, but if it's already very   thick when  still  hot add a little more milk. If it's too liquid on the  other hand, just keep  mixing  it over heat for  a while and it  will thicken very soon.  Add the crabmeat, plus the  pepper,  Parmesan cheese, soup stock granules and wine. Bring the sauce briefly to  a  boil to  evaporate the alcohol.  Taste while adding the soup stock; if it tastes too rich, reduce the amount. Turn  off the heat, and mix the egg yolks  in    very well. Pour the sauce into a shallow container lined with plastic wrap. When it's cooled down to room temperature cover with more plastic wrap and chill well in the refrigerator. If the  cream filling is soft   it will become easy   to handle after about an hour in  the refrigerator. When  it's  cooled and easy to handle, score the   surface into 15 to 16  portions.  Form the portions with  oiled  hands into small barrel shapes. Mix the ingredients together to make the coating liquid. Dip the croquettes into the liquid,  then coat with panko. If you like the  coating to be thick, dip the croquettes back in the liquid and then in the panko a second time. Cut a piece of absorbent paper into a rectangle and line the breaded croquettes on it. Put it in the frying oil paper  and all. (Take the paper out with  cooking  chopsticks.) This way the croquettes  won't  fall apart in the  oil, and there's  less chance of burning yourself. Deep  fry them quickly in 170-180C  oil. (See Hints.) Today I made a fresh tomato-based chili sauce to  go with the croquettes. See.",

    "4 Cadbury Creme Eggs\n1  egg, beaten\n1/2 cup flour\n8-12 cups of   vegetable or peanut  oil,  quantity depending on your pan\n1 cup flour\n1 tablespoon cocoa  powder\n1/2  teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup  milk\n1 tablespoon white vinegar\n1/2  tablespoon vegetable oil\n1 1/2 cups vanilla wafers, crushed (I   used Teddy Grahams)\nStart out by unwrapping your  Cadbury Creme Eggs. Freeze them  for at least 2 hours, or  even overnight-you want them to be like  little rocks. Near the  end of the chilling period, get yourself set  up. Have three  shallow   bowls handy: one with 1/2  cup of the flour, one with the beaten egg,  and  one containing the crushed vanilla  wafers. Also get  out a larger bowl,  for mixing your batter. Now, it's time to start heating the oil for frying. I poured  about 6 cups of vegetable oil into a  medium saucepan, so that it was about 4-5 inches deep. The exact quantity  of oil required will depend on  the size of your saucepan. Turn the heat to medium-high, and insert a candy or  frying thermometer.  The  oil needs to  reach 375°F on the thermometer,  which will take about  10-12 minutes. While the oil heats, prepare the  batter. Place 1/2 cup of flour in   a shallow bowl and set aside for  the  moment. Place 3/4 cup of  flour  in a  small bowl and stir in the cocoa powder, baking  powder, and  salt.  In a mixing  cup,  stir together the milk, vinegar,  and  oil. Whisk  the wet ingredients into the dry  until smooth and free of  most lumps. The  batter should be thicker than a pancake batter-if it seems  too liquidy (as if it might  drip off when you dip the Cadbury Creme Eggs  in it), whisk  in the remaining flour  until it has reached the desired  consistency. Remove the Cadbury Creme Eggs from your freezer. I found that  it is  best to fry one cupcake  at a time, so  you could  take them out of the    freezer a  couple at a time so that the eggs  fried later on don't get  too warm while sitting out. Using a spoon, coat an egg with the batter mixture. Use floured hands to mold the batter around the egg so that every bit  is    covered. First,  dredge the  battered Creme Egg in the flour, covering it  completely. Tap  off excess. Now,  coat the  floured  ball with the egg wash. Roll the egg wash coated ball   in  the cookie  crumbs, coating on all  sides. Using a slotted spoon, gently ease the crumb-coated orb into the hot oil. Once the batter has reached a pleasing golden hue  (a minute or  less),  remove the Cadbury Creme Scotch Egg   from the oil and transfer to a  plate covered with paper towel  to soak up  the excess grease.  Repeat the battering and frying process with the  remaining Cadbury Creme Eggs, battering and coating them one at a  time directly before  dipping in  the frying oil. While frying,  be sure to monitor the temperature of the oil and adjust your heat up  or  down accordingly so that it remains at 375°F. If  the oil is too cold  it won't fry  quickly enough and the chocolate eggs will soak  up too much grease; if it is too hot, the  outside will get dark before the inside  is fully warmed, leaving you with  a delicious shell but a still  gooey batter on the inside. Eat while still warm.",

Grill carefully so  the chicken doesnt  burn, making  sure the skin crisps and   browns and the interior cooks  through; it will take about 20 minutes. Brush  the  chicken heavily with the chipotle  sauce on both sides and cook for just  another minute or two. Serve, hot  or at room  temperature,  garnished with cilantro and with the lime wedges on the  side. Substitute about 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken or turkey breast,  which will take less than 10 minutes to grill. When done, cut into chunks and toss with the chipotle sauce. Serve  on toothpicks. Bone-in pork chops, preferably  from the shoulder end, can be  done exactly like the chicken in the  main recipe;  cooking  time will be a little shorter   (do   not allow them to dry out). Boneless pork (like tenderloin) can be used as in  the  chicken breast variation.",

Add the sugar, flour,  baking powder, salt, orange zest and cloves and mix  well. Cover and refrigerate for about an hour.  In the meantime,  make the chocolate  sauce. Combine the  chocolate and cream in a small saucepan and set  over low heat. Stir  occasionally until the  chocolate is just  melted, and then remove from the heat and  whisk until   smooth. Whisk in the vanilla, cinnamon and cayenne  pepper. If necessary,  whisk in a little bit of water to loosen the sauce. Set aside in a warm place.  Pour about an inch of oil into a wide, shallow  saucepan and  set over medium-high heat.  When a small  piece  of batter sizzles after you drop it into  the oil, you   are ready to fry.  Drop  rounded teaspoons of the batter into the oil in  small  batches and fry for about 2 minutes on each side, turning once,  until golden brown. Drain the fritters  on paper towels, dust with confectioners' sugar  and serve immediately with the chocolate sauce (if  it has thickened  too   much, you may need  to reheat the sauce gently, whisking  constantly, and add a bit more water).

Put  the bowl  in  the freezer and leave it there for 30 minutes. Bag your berries or lay them  on a  sheet pan and also freeze  for up to 30 minutes. This  will  help keep the berries distinct  and  from mashing  into your cookie  batter. Meanwhile, adjust the oven rack  to the middle position and preheat  the oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet  with parchment paper  or   spray with nonstick spray. Using a pastry cutter or a  fork, work the chilled ingredients together in the bowl  until the butter cubes are the size of peas. Make a well in the center. Combine the  vanilla and milk in a separate bowl,  and pour the  mixture  into  the well.  Mix the  ingredients with a spoon to form a shaggy, slightly crumbly mass. Let stand for 3 to 5 minutes to let  the flour absorb the liquid, then fold one  more time. If the dough seems simply too  dry  to come together, add 1 tablespoon milk at a time  until  it just barely comes together. Add the frozen berries and gently mix them  in.   Using  a spoon, scoop the batter on baking sheet about 1 inch  apart. Or you could spread the batter  across the baking sheet and    slice the cookies   when ready to serve. Bake for 10-15  minutes until the center is still soft and the edges are golden brown. Serve immediately with a glass of cold milk.",

Pour the  mixture into  the pan and bake for 10 minutes, then  reduce the temperature  to 250°F and bake until the cake is just set (it will still wobble a little in  the middle),   45 to 60 minutes.  Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool completely. While the  cheesecake is cooling, make the apple cardamom compote. In a heavy-bottomed   saucepan over medium heat, add the  apples,  cardamom, and sugar,  and then cover three-quarters of the apples with water. Cook the liquid in  the  pan until  the compote reduces by half and comes together,  about  45 minutes. Set  aside until the cheesecake is  ready to serve.

Allow to sit till the baking dish is just cool enough to handle & serve warm.  NOTES: I could   not get individual brioches or a lrg brioche loaf, so I used a dense Italian bread. A less dense bread does work  best as it  allows  for better absorption of the custard mix. The recipe does not tell you to do this, but I  suggest lightly brushing the  exposed crusty edges of the overlapping brioche  (or  bread) slices w/butter using a pastry brush  when the tent is removed.",

Check to make sure the bottom of the  bowl is not touching the  water, or the eggs may scramble. With a  hand held  electric mixer, beat the egg yolks and sugar  together until  pale yellow. Add the Marsala and set  the bowl over the simmering water. Continue to beat with the electric mixer until the   eggs triple in volume, thicken  and reach a temperature of 140 F., as registered on an  instant thermometer. Be  sure to beat  the eggs until  they reach   this  temperature at  which salmonella bacteria is killed. This will take about 10 to 15 minutes. Be sure  to move the beater around  the bowl so the eggs cook evenly;  there will  be quite a bit of  spattering. TO SERVE THE  ZABAGLIONE: Transfer the mixture to   wine   glasses and serve immediately accompanied by ladyfingers or Italian cookies known as \"Savoiardi.\" An alternative way to serve this is  to take  slices of pound cake or panettone and set them on a broiler  pan. Cover the cake slices with a layer of sliced strawberries or peeled Comice  pear, and ladle a  portion of the zabaglione over the  fruit.   Broil  the slices for a minute or until the zabaglione is bubbling and lightly  browned. Serve  immediately.",
    "So about 20 minutes  after doing a delivery and   while  I’m in the middle of another delivery I  get  a phone  call from  the delivery I had just finished saying that  they had accidentally put the wrong address and  that they  never received their order.   I am asked by them that if I  could make  the phone   call  to customer service  asking that they be compensated for their missing order.  I politely agreed totally not  even thinking about  why can’t they do  it themselves.  After calling in to customer service and requesting the refund   for  the customer and at the same time doing  another two deliveries, I get a text message letting me know  that  the customer accidentally put  in the wrong address and wants me to issue them a refund.  At this point I get  very frustrated and start a chat with customer service.   After explaining the issue they tell me that I should let the customer know to call in  themselves and that  I dropped off the order to the address on file  so basically it’s no longer my  problem.   Thank God.   After letting the customer know that they need to  call  customer service themselves I get a message of  the middle   finger.... twice.

    "Now,  some people may tell me it   is not an egg. The most common theory in the community is that the egg is a  sentient fungus. I do  not believe this is true.  Unless Badboyhalo is bamboozling  us, the  egg would have told  him he is not an egg. Teh  thing is, Badboyhalo refers  to the egg  as the egg. The egg probably  would have corrected him otherwise. Now, on to the theory. Some people believe that a person  is  going  to come out of  the egg. This person has to be important of it  to work as an important  event. I still think this is unlikely, I think Quackity reviving  him is more likely.  What I  believe is the true purpose  of  the egg is to  hatch- itself. Hear me out. An egg enters a timeline  with  a  living Karl  in it to start.  it gains power and tries to take over the whole  area. When it hatches,  it  releases spores that latch on to Karl. He travels with  it using the other side into  a different time  stream. The egg  Badboyhalo found was sent into  the timestream we see by another Karl. I think Bad is kind of  the egg's  chosen one.   It would make sense that if  the egg is successful, bad becomes the egg's consciousness in the next timestream.  Sir Billiam is kind of Bad's equivalent. Maybe the present-day egg has  Sir Billaims consciousness. That would  explain  when  the  egg in the masquerade timeline hides and lures in victims, while our  egg is definitely not  trying  to  hide. What do you think?",

It  encouraged building lethality so you could 1 shot  someone  just by landing E. After seeing the numerous reddit clips on multiple communities, it dawned upon me that  the Yorick that  I'm  seeing being played isn't  the same Yorick I fell   in love playing with in the last couple of seasons. I  simply wish to bonk turrets and champions, yet what is the state of  Yorick this  patch? You press E  and the enemy  champion  dies. And now,  with the upcoming nerfs directly to mist walkers and E, without any  compensation Yorick is pretty much going to be in  the  same state as he was  before buffs. I wish that rather than directly  nerfing Yorick,    they  would redirect his power from just his mist  walkers and  E and spread  it throughout his kit.",
    "So I've been in this crave to listen to scary stories or  of thing that are unexplained and unnerving. Lately I  feel very jumpy and feeling  as though  I'm seeing things that may not actually be there. This has  been happening before too where  I think I  see  something but    it's   gone. It's been  happening before  my spooky stories. What  prompted me  to look this up  and as this question is my friend and I  were on my way to my house when I thought  I saw a siluoette of a hooded, hunched  figure. I'll be honest I'm scared and that's why I wanted to look it up. If it's nothing to be worried about then I'll probably take a  break for a   while  and watch   other things.  If  it something that cannot be explained then I need to go get help. I appreciate it. Sorry  to bring such  a bewildering story on here but  I need  to know for sure for my mind. Thank you",
    "I watched a clip of an  anime that  i really liked but i   lost  it and now can’t find it. Please   help me  find it. The story was about a girl and a  boy. The boy was tall  and the  girl was short. The boy was also really pretty. They’re both at school. The boy gets sick and is about to faint. The girl saves him  and offers him food. The boy eats  it and gets well. The next day,  they boy  comes to school and thanks the girl for  saving  his life. He asks her if she  wants  anything in return. The  girl doesn’t say anything. Then the boy  says  that he  can give her a kiss. The  girl gets all flustered  and angry and tells the boy that  she didn’t  save him because  she  wanted something in return. The boy apologises and tells the girl  that he is  in love with her now that she has saved his life. Please help  me find this anime. I really  wanna watch  it.",
    "I've not wanted to  live  for the last 6 years now,  it all started  when I started  overworking myself, got really stressed, developed depression then  lost my hair. I went to therapy, with different people all telling  me my feelings were somewhat irrelevant as I had \"a nice life, a  nice family  and friends\". I lost all trust in psychiatrists from  then on, even though  I know I need help,  I would rather keep considering killing  myself instead of putting that dread  and huge  feeling of  inadequacy back into it. I'd always told  myself that I'd wait until my  mum died   as the harm that would cause  her would  have  huge repercussions, she would absolutely blame herself.  But now, I have  absolutely  no friends, I can't  find a decent job and every day I   wake up  with the total  feeling of dread of not wanting to continue   on. My issues  with how we've built  our society won't ever change,  the lack of trust I've developed with people, and especially those supposedly there \"to  help\" won't  ever change, my lack of empathy towards others won't change, so  what's the point in  going on? I can't really  find it, and I'm starting  to get tired of the selflessness I've felt in  not doing this earlier, I've wasted my  life  and I don't want to keep going. I think I  might finally bite the bullet and not  think of the repercussions. Life has no purpose,  I   have  no purpose, I'm just really starting   to lose  it. Sorry if  this isn't the place for this, I just really need to get it off my chest and have  no  one to tell that won't blame me for  it, as they always do.",

    "Didn’t think i’d  ever  have  to  post  here   but here it  is. I have a 6 month old aussie-lab mix who  does great playing with other  dogs and gets really excited   to see them. Recently went to a puppy manners training course to try to teach her  how to act on leash around  other puppies  without any interaction. As soon as   we came in and tried to  put her  in  a sit,  she started whining and panting because she saw other dogs which  led  to her barking. We kept trying  to get  her under control and most of the class  was just me getting her in a down for a couple of seconds or   holding her back.  She  never barked or panicked like that before and I feel very set back on my training around other dogs as well as just overall bond with my dog  because she prefers so  many  other things rather than me. The trainer even helped by putting   up  a fence and blanket so she couldn’t notice other dogs. This helped  for some time  but   she still had that anxiety in her that made her  want to keep getting up and  barking. We’re hoping the  next class is going  to be easier because of more exposure but right  now i’m feeling like shit if i’m going to  be honest. We also just got  food delivered and  when the delivery guy knocked, she got up and barked while running to the door. Never barked  at the door before.  Feel like absolute  shit in terms of my training with her. Somebody help. ",
    "My ex23 M called me the other night three  months after he broke  up with me. I picked up. He told me he missed and loved me. He told me I was his soul mate and he miss our relationship.   He told  me he didn’t want us to be over and would work on our relationship.  I said  to him “ you traumatized me and  I couldn’t be   with him Bc of how our  relationship was”.  He  was confused. He told me he  didn’t think our relationship was unhealthy. He thought  there was nothing wrong with  it. He made   me cry,  treated my poorly, secretly talked and hung out with other women and gaslighted me. But he couldn’t see any of those  things being wrong. He told me he thought we were  in a healthy relationship. I was kind of shocked but not surprised. But how could someone who cheated, lied, and gaslighted   think   our relationship was healthy?  We  would get  into arguments  a lot about   me not   trusting him and he thought it was healthy.  The last 3  months of us not being together I’ve had to   do so much reflecting and I’ve had nightmares  about him  cheating on me. He  doesn’t even see  how those  things can be traumatizing ",
    "I ordered the Samsung   Galaxy S21 Ultra  5G  512 GB in color Phantom Black originally back on  March 2, 2021 from AT&amp;T. I finally received  it  on  April  8 2021. I waited  a very long time to get this particular model and I  only  found out about a delay because  of chip shortages from Reddit. First of all  to even remove the expandable  memory slot and then have customers have to  wait  a  lengthy amount of time for their order because they choose the 512GB version is insane. My cellphone carrier kept saying it  was coming... it will be there in a couple of days etc.  for the entire time. I told myself  once  I get it I will post it on Reddit  just so maybe I can  end some  frustration for anyone else  waiting for their order.  The one good thing that I can say however  is that I love this  phone. It did not disappoint. I  had used the Samsung Galaxy Note phones for  at least 6 or 7 years. It  was hard to get me away from the Note  versions, had my Samsung Note 9 for  the a little over 2 years.  I had a lot of wear and tear on   my  phone so  I did a lot  if research to narrow  down my next cellphone purchase choice. I am  so  glad I decided  to get a different version this time. Samsung cellphones are  my go to  brand and will continue  to be in the future. The Samsung Galaxy   Ultra  5G phone is  a definite winner. So many pros and a few cons but  the features and  specs are remarkable so  I will no doubt recommend this   brand  to anyone who wants to purchase a new cellphone   in   the near future.",
    "Hi  all, I've just  finished watching the latest trilogy of Star Trek movies: Star Trek, Into Darkness, and Beyond. I really enjoyed this  movie, and I'd never consumed any Star  Trek material previously. I very  much like this attitude towards space as a final  frontier: something to be explored. I  would have liked  to see a little  more exploration and intrigue,  but I  suppose movies need dire/somewhat immediate  threats. I'd love to continue to experience this  universe, but I'm not totally  sure where to go  next, as there's so  much out there. Should  I watch a  newer series like Star Trek: Discovery?  Should I  go farther back and watch some of the older series? I'm  curious as to  where you   all think a new  fan should start.",

We’ve never   been  to a  shelter before  but we do get food stamps and cash assistance from the city.

Furthermore, if, on  the AP credits webpage, it says “You have the equivalent of BIO130H1,”  does that means  I won’t have  to take that course if it is required for applying to the program? if  so, What mark  will i  be  assigned?

    "When I was  about 10-14 my brother showed me a game that he pirated and let me play it. It was a  game thats like ddr where you    just used arrow  keys  to  play along  the   music, it was mostly anime songs that  he would have to download and add  to  it. It was the first game that I ever tried being good at  because I wanted  to beat him so bad lol.. I went on to FFR, the site was flash flash revolution  which seemed  to be  harder but I could play on a web browser.

    "Ever  since the   Aquafina  Sparkling  commercial where they changed the pitch of the guys voice, I've noticed that  Spotify ads are the absolute worst. I have no problem with TV commercials, even the insurance company ones, but Spotify ads are extremely  obnoxious. Along the way   we've  had the  guy with  Mac &amp; Cheese in his mouth, the Capital One ads  with  the  obnoxious baby voice, the ads  for Spotify  Premium itself, and countless other totally  obnoxious ads. It seems like every Spotify ad now is something super annoying. Plus, they're all so much louder than  the music, especially if I'm listening to ambient or classical, so they blast super loudly. I can't  listen to quiet music  for sleeping because the ads blast so loudly. I'm   sure the companies  that  make the ads  are genuinely attempting  to make good ads, but I feel like  Spotify  purposely hand-picks the ads that are super annoying to make people  upgrade to  premium so they don't have to hear these terrible ads.

    "I  don't understand why the  fuck   it's funny to make fun of elders. They have more experience than you, they lived  through different times. Sure, they can be stupid, arrogant, stereotypical  and  bad with technology. But this is present  in  every generation, not just them. We should value  their experience and contribution. We  should listen  to  their stories and advice, not necessarily  take it,  but listen. You can't devalue  someone  because they're old and need  help to understand. My own grandparents  have shitty opinions and think in  a very old fashion manner, I'll argue with  them  and try to change their view, but not     call them out for not thinking like me.

I know I have a little while  to go, but I've  been thinking  about  it since I  got the  job. During orientation, they said that historically, they match 20% with a maximum of  $2,000. I'm a little lost on how to do the calculations on how much I should  put in to get the max \"free money\".  Is it $10,000 annually?

    "So I was just  randomly curious on  what people  thought about the Wolverine vs Deadpool regeneration debate as to  which one is stronger. To me  I  always  just assumed  everyone thought Deadpool’s was  stronger but I’ve seen a lot  of people argue  they’re about equal  or even  wolverine’s is stronger.  My  opinion  is  that Deadpool’s is functionally stronger because if I remember correctly  almost every source claims that wolverine can technically be killed if his brain were damaged enough  or if his spine  were to somehow be severed  from his head. I  believe there was even  a time professor Xavier  himself stated  this  but I forgot from  where. And Deadpool regularly takes off his own head. Of course, wolverine  is certainly sturdier because of his skeleton, but I’m just saying fundamentally Deadpool’s should be stronger if it allows him to survive his spine being severed. ",
    "Going to be seeing  a new car and possibly buying  it at a dealership next  weekend. Car is $25k,  I'm  putting  $15k as a down payment. I'm going to get  a loan from my bank for the  rest and was  told  by  a family member  to ask  for the loan for  the  full amount.  Got  approved  for the loan online and got a great APR rate of  2.75% for 60 months, however since I put it for the full amount  of the car, the  monthly  payment is very high, $450 a month.  I have used the online carfax  payment calculator and  entered my down payment and it gives a rate of around $160 a  month. My question is do  I ask for $25k loan or ask for  a lower one around  $12k that will cover the cost of the car after the down payment  as well as $2k  for taxes and fees?  That way I get the lower monthly rate.   SOrry, this is the first new  car I am buying.",

Like  I know they  probably  explain later on in the story  but I  just can't  even be bothered, second, why  tf would  they   skip so  much?

Soph and jess? I think?

Sure we had our fights  but we worked them out...or so i had thought. After   deciding on what house to buy and possibly names for kids. The next   morning she  said to me she  wanted to  break up i was confused and said may i know why ?  She just said she  wanted to and i said thats a bit vague but she nevergavea reply back to.  We agreed that we should and we did  but  shortly afterward i came home one night from work and she said she was  dating some  guy less then  24 hrs of breaking up. I understand once you break  up with  someone its  not cheating   but I felt so much  pain that I  still don't   fully understand.  To make matters worse i had lost my  job in the  same day. Now i am skipping over more painful parts  like how she took the rest  of my money saying she would go buy groceries and  instead spent it  all on her new  lover. But thats not why im writing this post. In truth I want to  know what I still feel  depressed  over  it ?  Like  why do I still remember her  smile or other  things ? Which  just makes me feel really lonely  and i never experienced anything  like this before.",
    "Played a few games since he is up for free to play at first  really  hated the character  just couldn't get a feel for how they  worked but for some reason kept playing with  them and after  a couple of games I really started to like the  character debating on picking   him up for my bot  main but wanted to  check here beforehand. It wouldn't be the  first time I picked  up a champ  because   I enjoyed them  in ftp but after  a week they get put on the bench so I want to see if there is anything I should  be aware off like really  bad matchups  or really good matchup, or items that work  really well or really bad with him. You know  basically anything you would learn after several  games not  the  handful of  games I  will  play before ftp ends I also  plan  to watch a few videos  as well.",
    "My bf and I have been together over a year, last week I got a message from someone in  his past  saying he was a abuser, gay, a  rapist, a narcissistic manipulator that  just uses woman,he definitely is a narcissist and a manipulator, and I do pay  half his rent and buy all the groceries and do all the housework, I am on disability,all  the relationships before me he has moved in with the women,,  so there is a bit of truth to some  of this, when  I told him  about  the letter, he said it  was  bs and not to make  it “ all about  me”. When ever  I try to  talk he  always turns the  conversation   to himself and doesn’t really  want my advice,  or think I should  be concerned,I’ve been abused before  so  I  don’t and can’t  take this lightly  like  he seems to be, it’s not that I  believe her totally but I’m not 100%  sure  I believe him either,,  what can I  possibly do to stop this from eating away  at me? I can’t sleep ,I can’t eat,, I told him  to go to police with letter for slander  and see  a lawyer, but he doesn’t  seem to be  in a hurry for it,, if it  was me  I’d be devastated and pissed  off if this was  all untrue and would definitely  confront her  and the situation, she also sent a letter to  his work",
    "I’ve had an agent that gets  me   auditions regularly for pretty big projects, mostly commercials.   These   always pay decently well to a lot, and while I’ve  been auditioning  for the past year, I haven’t booked anything yet.  I want to revolve my career around video  games, so  I’ve been   looking at  posts from people casting for indie games on  various sites. My  main question is this: since I  don’t have much on my resume, should I still submit to everything I  can, even if  it doesn’t pay/has very little pay? Or should I set a minimum rate  I’d be willing  to work for so that in the  event I do book a project on something I   submitted  for myself and my agent gets commission, they  don’t get the impression I’m working for chump change/devaluing my work?",
    "So I've been really thinking of  this all the  time and would like to know I'm not  alone. I've been  a  foodie ever since I was a kid, but also I think especially during the last year I started developing emotional eating or junk food addiction.   And  I do  somewhat blame it  on how I used to watch a lot of food instragrammers and youtubers and would get jealous of how often  they had store bought snacks and  I started wanting  the same. I'm  just frustrated  because I know how much good food is going to make me feel better and  how much money I'll save  by  not buying  snacks and coffees like   almost   everyday, but I keep excusing my  behavior with  being alone  and sad. Especially that now I decided to take  a break   of BC I want  to support my body  with a good diet. I would really appreciate  anyone just sharing their own  story or struggles about this topic, or if anyone has overcame  emotional eating and junk food addiction",
    "So in the  first Hitman game  we got all the basic mastery  stuff.  Guns, poisons,  explosives, knives, the basics. Everything you need. Then in 2 they gave us loads of cool  shit. Dart guns, EMPs,  magic powders, crowbars, the works. So much  cool shit. And fun shit  too, flamingos  and  fish and homing cases. And I was really hoping  3 would up the ante even more in that  respect, but instead all we got were a lot of reskins of the items from 1. I can't think of a single new and  cool  item that I'm  excited to experiment with  that  I've  gotten  from Hitman 3.

    "Eu   sou diabético, porém  meu caso não  é tão grave, se eu faço  a dieta direitinho, eu posso comer qualquer  coisa  sem problemas.  E  ontem Páscoa né, eu ansioso pros meu ovo chegar e  a moça que me vendeu  só estava me enrolando  desde manhã,  eai eu falando    pra essa minha amiga da raiva que eu estava  e ela tentando fazer eu me conformar e tal, aí quando eu meio que acalmei, ela  disse: \"vc devia falar  comigo toda  vez que sente  vontade de comer  doce\", aí eu falei: \"aí nossa amizade ia  acabar\"   e mandei uma figurinha do Bart chorando.   Então tipo, eu falei pra ela,  que eu tinha me comportado a semana passada e eu queria comer chocolate né, e que tipo, por mais que eu faça as coisas  direito, a  gente tem  a necessidade de comer um doce de vez  em quando.  Aí ela ficou  puta, começou falar  que eu preferia os doces do que os  amigos, e na real, pra mim os  dois caminham lado   a lado  na vida. Se eu não como doce  eu fico estressado e se eu não tenho  amigos, eu  me  sinto sozinho, o  que me deixa triste e me leva a comer doce pra maquiar a tristeza.

    "I've often   wondered if there  is a  far  greater purpose at  play with the  character of Rocks, I   can't see Oda as having created  the character  only for him to be used  as  a 5 second  backstory for  some  of the Yonko/Garp. I feel as though in the future we may see the character return. Perhaps he merely faked his   own  death at God Valley in order to achieve his ambition of becoming king of  the world in secret? It just seems a bit sus that 50 chapters after  we  are shown  this mysterious  new character of Imu, that we should see the character of Rocks D Xebec be revealed as well.  If he is powerful enough to have an entire boat full of Yonko follow  him, then  I would say  it's definitely possible for him to have beaten the Gorosei into submission.  Perhaps  before Xebec became the king of the world the 5 elders actually did rule  reasonably and  were corrupted by Xebec  into more and more  distasteful acts?",
    "I applied for EIDL loan in  April 2020 using  the short form most  likely. I used videos on YouTube to help guide me on how to  apply. I received a grant  for 1k and  loan for about 10k. Now that  I am waiting on the review for  the targeted   advanced grant, I realized  I   may have entered incorrect numbers. I closed my old business  and opened a new one. Rather   than change the name  I started all  over. This was around September/October of 2019. Once I fully transitioned I had maybe two months of income reported in  my profit and loss. For the PPP  and everything I used the correct data. I thought I did the same  for  EIDL. Looking at the forms  I was  supposed to put in gross  revenues for  before January  2020 and something makes me think I put in expected for 2020 and that is why  I got a loan for  10k.  I am worried I will be   denied for the  targeted grant and  thats one of the  reasons why its taking so long. The IRS has  yet to process  my 2019 Tax returns.  If  I send in my 2020 tax return will that help? Should  I fix  it while it is in review?  Is there a way to get a   copy of the application so  I can check?",

    "So I’ve been pretty excited with all  the Disney Villainous expansions that we have gotten  and   will get  but I’m  kinda curious if Ravensburger have  future plans on doing Pixar Villainous. Since Disney owns Pixar I was thinking it would be really  cool to   see they’re  take  on how the Pixar Villains will win. Obviously  I feel there’s  a few  Villains for I think would be really amazing  to see. For  example, Mister Waternoose from Monsters Inc. His goal could  be  literally be  to scare Boo  enough  times to fill up a certain number  of canisters with her screams, as well as  having ally  cards be Randal and other scare monsters from the floor. Also it would be  cool to give  Hopper from Bug’s Life a chance to throw down. As we known he’s main goal is to  make the worker  ants bring him  enough food to survive the winter. It  would be pretty cool to see  how the circus troop  play out against  him in the game. Another villain that would be interesting to see from  Pixar  universe  is AUTO from  WALL-E. I love WALL-E and and nothing would scream crazy villain like an ai computer forcing the main kind to be lazy and  to  give   up on    returning back to earth. AUTO goal could be to obtain  the plant and try to destroy it. Ideally there are many villains that could appear if they ever did  a Pixar edition to of  Disney Villainous,  but   will we ever see it come  to fruition? Who would you think would be interesting to see from the Pixar world   entering into the Villainous board game world?",
    "Ever  wondered what it would be like to see Tom Cruise taking a break from his usual Sci-Fi & Impossible series \"avatar\". Well, here is your answer -  It  gets even more exciting and entertaining. This is Tom Cruise's real life take on the  impossible series where  Barry Seal replaces Ethan Hunt  and CIA as the agency, which dictates  the terms. It's just that Barry loves  to go with the flow and  without  any intention of getting involved with anything  that seems out of his league and this is something each  one of  us can relate to. He is your usual guy  who happens   to be a pilot and wants  to make  some extra cash with every  extra mile. So  what's wrong with  it? Well nothing  is  wrong when you do it for  the right guys, and nothing gets more exciting and dangerous when those right guys turn out to be CIA.<br/><br/>What is even  more amusing and entertaining to watch is the fact that despite having no choice  left but to cooperate  with CIA,  \"Barry Seal never says no\" to  any offer (even if it  comes from any  drug   lord) that helps him maintain his cash flow that obviously  was becoming unmanageable for  him by every  passing day.  Although, I  must admit that  it  was  quite  a  fun to watch him trying to manage millions of  cash that he had no idea how to  spend. <br/><br/>You will definitely enjoy  watching Tom cruise as Barry Seal who uses CIA to get  his end  of the bargain (and they thought that they were the  only smart guys who live in  one of  the  greatest countries of the world).<br/><br/>If you want to  go  on  an adventure trip, go  watch this  movie and  you will  understand what Tom Cruise  really means when he says, \"I am just a gringo who always  delivers\".",
    "My name  is Cecilia and being from Manila this film is very personal to me because my grandfather sacrificed his life during WWII. According to  eyewitness  accounts, he was tied to a post, doused with kerosene and set  on   fire. I am watching this film to somehow  pay tribute to him and  those   who selflessly gave up their lives to ensure a free  and  humane future for all of us. I felt though that the    film underestimated what we Filipinos really went through during the war. It would  have been just to include  the other atrocities perpetuated by the  Japanese: babies thrown in the air and caught  with bayonets, women brutally raped and breasts carved out, or  the   massacre  of approximately 100,000  unarmed  and innocent  civilians during the battle  for the liberation of Manila on the  first  days of February 1945. Nevertheless, I  am grateful for director John Dahl for shedding light on a chapter in our history that many people hardly know about   , specially the present generation, The Bataan  Death March. ",
    "How many times do I need  to read  other's  reviews on disaster films before I remember most people   on here writing  these think they are actual film  critics? It is a disaster  movie. Yes, the science is terrible.  Yes the coincidences are fantastical. If  you watch these for ground breaking stories with rich  plots, or for an Oscar worthy performance by one of the  actors, then you are watching these for the wrong damn reasons.\nThis movie shows a future where due to the rise in global  temperatures, a modern ice age is triggered. How  it is ushered  in is by these violent, giant hurricane-like storms that cause flash freezing, and bring in a  myriad of disasters with  them. These include   tsunamis and  blizzards that  drop so many feet of snow  that people are walking level with the signs on the interstate that you would normally drive under. It also tries to throw in  a lot of relatable human elements,  such as the  struggle  of a man that is an absentee  parent  because of his  job, trying to  connect with  his son, a  lonely boy  dying of cancer, and just the human death that this kind  of disaster would bring.\nDo not watch this for the science, though  I do feel that they   had the  causation  of another  ice age correct. Do  not watch this for deep plot. Watch this for the  enjoyable ride on    which it  takes  you.",
    "Went to an advance screening expecting your usual \"shy kid in  high school learns to stick  up for himself\" sort of feel-good drama.  This movie is so much more than that -  I was truly  blown away by  the  mature  themes and moving characters. Mental illness,  sexual abuse,  drugs and  alcohol...  I think the writer/screenwriter/director said  it best in the   Q+A after when he said it was a film that looked at the emotional  aspects of  that point in  life without  being sentimental. I really cared about these three  teens - Charlie, Sam, and Patrick -  and their story never felt cheesy. Just real, and moving, and touching. Go see  this movie!",
    "\"I used to think this was the   beginning of your  story.... We're so bound  by time\",  Dr. Louise Banks said   within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing  that this was the true theme of the whole  movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are,  what we think, how we see the world around us,  etc. When the alien race  comes to  earth  Dr. Banks is tasked  with discovering their language and how to communicate  with them to understand why they're here. As  she  learns more  she  discovers that they  don't think  like we think, or  communicate like we communicate. She  discovers the aliens are not bound by time as  the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use \"the weapon\".<br/><br/>There's dialogue  between Ian and Dr. Banks  halfway through the film where  they discuss the   Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which  essentially means if you  study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you  speak determines how  you  think.  As Dr. Banks learns more of  this alien language she begins acquiring the  knowledge to think  how  they think - which is non-linear, unbound  by time.<br/><br/>This theme is  present through the whole movie:  from her daughter, to the spelling of her   daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the  film), to the  big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But  the true  beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks,  we too understand that  the story itself is non-linear  -  the beginning of the movie is actually the end.  We see the beginning and think it's the  beginning as you normally   do, but as we  become  immersed  and  follow Dr.  Banks, learning what she learns, we  too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The question is: if you knew your  life  from  beginning to end, would you  change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a  thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated  as such. Arrival showcases the art of  storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a  10/10",
    "Tom  Hanks wrote and directed this paean to the glory days of rock n' roll,  an era in which even the  wildest music still reflected a certain innocence,  long  since  gone if not forgotten, before the advent of Metal, Rap  and Grunge.  It's 1964, and `That  Thing You Do!' is about   to become a hit record for a small band out of Erie,  Pa., who  call themselves the `Oneders (pronounced Wonders),' but who are destined  to begin their musical odyssey know  as the `Oh-NEED-ers.'   Drummer Guy Patterson  (Tom Everett  Scott) works in his father's appliance store, but when the band's drummer breaks his arm right before  a gig, Guy is asked  to  sit in for him.  And it winds up being  a  case of being  in the right place at  the right time for Guy, like   when Ringo joined The Beatles,  and the rest--  as they say-- is history.<br/><br/>\tIt's a lively, upbeat  tale  in which luck, talent  and chance  all play a part.  Hanks presents the upside of  making it  in the  music   business, including the adrenaline rush of  hearing  one's own song on the radio for the first time, as well as  all the hoopla that surrounds   those  who  happen to be in the spotlight at the moment.  But he  also shows the downside:  The creative differences and in-fighting which  plagues just about any band ever formed to some degree at one  time or another,  the personality conflicts and petty  jealousies that are  apt to  surface at any time, and  the reality of dealing with bloated egos, adoring fans and rude,  insensitive record label executives who  could care less about the talent that is putting the coins   in  their coffers, as long  as they're selling records.<br/><br/>\tFor  the most part, Hanks keeps  it lighthearted and  cheerful,  which--  along with the original songs  (some of which he helped write)-- makes this an  entertaining, fun and thoroughly  enjoyable  movie.  He sugar-coats  the dark  side of it all to a  certain extent, which makes the bad  things that  happen  a bit easier to swallow, though it compromises  the  impact of   the events somewhat as they unfold.   Then again, he manages to maintain the credibility and integrity of his  story, and  after  all, `this' is the film he wanted to make, and  he presents it exactly as intended.  Hanks  captures a sense of time and place with this film, and also that same sense of reality conveyed by The Beatles' film, `A Hard Day's Night,'   intentionally  avoiding the more stoic reality  of the more recent `Almost Famous.'   All three films are fairly true to life, but with varying degrees of  honesty.  It's a matter of whether to `imply,' as Hanks has done,  or to be explicit, as Cameron   Crowe chose to  do  with his film.<br/><br/>\tWith this film Hanks proves that  he is equally  as   adept behind the camera as he is  in front of it; he knows exactly where he wants to take  his audience  and when, and he does it quite successfully.  He also extracts some  nice performances from  his  actors, especially Scott, Johnathon Schaech  (Jimmy, the   lead singer), Steve Zahn (Lenny, on guitar) and Liv Tyler as Faye Dolan, Jimmy's girlfriend, who takes the brunt of the blunt edge of  Jimmy's sudden notoriety.   Hanks also turns in a notable  performance himself, as Mr. White, the representative of one of the labels interested in the  Oneders.<br/><br/>\tThe supporting cast includes Ethan Embry (The  Bass Player), Charlize Theron  (Tina), Obba Babatunde (Lamarr), Giovanni Ribisi (Chad), Chris Ellis (Phil),  Alex Rocco  (Sol), Bill Cobbs (Del Paxton), Peter Scolari  (Tony), Rita  Wilson (Marguerite), Chris Isaak (Uncle Bob)   and Kevin  Pollak   (Boss Koss).   What  `Happy Days' was to television,  `That Thing  You Do!' is to movies;  a film that evokes that perceived sense  of  innocence of a time when life at least seemed simpler.   For the more distance you put  between the present and the `Good old days,' the better they get.   In reality, they may not  have been better,  but Hanks preserves that illusion  by giving us a picture of the  way we'd at least like to think things were.  And  it's more than a  pleasant diversion; this is a feel-good film  you'll be  able  to enjoy time and again, because  it takes you to a  place you'd like to be-- a place  you've been to before  at  one  time or another, in  one way or another, if only  in  your  mind. And that Hanks can take  you  there so readily is not only a credit  to  his talent,  but another fine  example of the pure magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10. ",
    "Akira Kurosawa's  1985, Ran, is based one  of Shakespeare's greatest works,  King's Lear. The Film proudly stands along with his  other  classic such as  Seven   Samurai, Yojimbo,  Roshomon, Sanjuro and the  Hidden Fortress. He  is a master in the  art of filmmaking, no one can film an epic battle  scene quite like Kurosawa. This is recognized as the  most  expensive film ever made by  Akira Kurosawa, it was at that  time, Japan's most  expensive film  ever.  Being at the age of 75, he still showed  us,  he's one of the best  in  the business.<br/><br/>This movie is about an aging lord, head  of the  Ichimonji family, decides to retire and to pass the power to  Taro, the eldest  of his three sons. He  will  however have to banish Saburo, the youngest one, who dared  to  speak the truth to him. Soon, the former lord is chased away from the castles of  his sons and becomes mad when he understands that one of his sons is trying to  kill  him. The three brothers  are fighting for  control of the  Kingdom, as their lust for power grows every day. Four armies are  facing  each other on the prairie. Lord Ichimonji's former peaceful  kingdom is  nothing but a  distant memory.<br/><br/>Akira Kurosawa  redefines what an epic film is, with  astonishing  story telling, entirely believable characters and real life battle  scenes without the use of Special effects/CGI. He retells the  story of King Lear in his own  way and no one would recognize that it was actually a adaptation beforehand. But  just like Shakespeare, there is humor, irony, death and not a happy  ending. Everyone  who played a part in  the  production of this film,  deserves some  kind of recognition. The acting  is pretty much excellent and certainly  believable.<br/><br/>10/10 Kurosawa is a Genius ",
    "First off, the downsides: Some parts of the  movie seemed a  little drawn  out, the film was  two hours, and at certain times, you could feel that.  It's far-fetched, and I can imagine some people rolling their eyes  at the   storyline, and there WILL be some people walking out saying \"that was  a  stupid movie\". (As many people responded to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.) Of course, some of them will be saying that in response to the sheer amount of gore and violence, which  brings  me into the 'upsides': This  movie certainly had it's 'wow' moments with  shock, anticipation, and gore, especially near the climax. Scenes  and even alleyways and monsters from  the games were almost identical. If  you've played  the games you will get a  lot of deja  vu. (For example, the  camera goes crooked at exactly the same time  and place it does in one of the scenes  in   the  game.) Also,  a lot of the sounds and music  tracks from  the games  are used, and so are the monsters.  The entire feel of the games  is preserved   in  the  film, and you  will have trouble keeping your feet  on the floor the entire movie. The creepy presentation works, and if you   haven't played any of the games, this movie   will scare you in new ways. ",
    "I have to say that  the most   fun I had at the movies this  summer  was when I saw  American Pie, the funniest picture I've seen  since last    summer's  There's  Something  About  Mary. This movie  has taken the classic teenage boy film (Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds) and spruced it up for  the 90's.  It is hilarious from start to  finish. If you like physical comedy,  gross out comedy, sexual comedy, American Pie has it all.  A  great ensemble cast of  likeable young actors makes this a joy to watch.     <br/><br/>I  think this year's breakout star has  to be Chris Klein.    He was phenomenal in  Election and he is even better here as a  jock who tries to soften his image to score before   prom. I have a feeling Klein is  going to  be Hollywood's next  big thing and I hope he has a chance to flex his acting muscles in some different movies (I can definitely see this  guy in an action film).<br/><br/>Also  very  good is Jason Biggs who plays the sympathetic Jim character, the guy who  is least likely   to lose his virginity.    His antics are very funny to follow and   he gets the lion  share of the laughs. Finally a huge  ovation  for Eugene Levy, who gets major laughs as the Jim's dad.",
    "Peter Jackson truly outdid himself  when creating the Lord of the  Rings: The Fellowship of   the Ring and he fails to disappoint us  in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows  us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like  so many directors are. I actually think that  The Two  Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.<br/><br/>This film is  the biggest  film in  the  trilogy.  What do I mean by that? Well this  film has  so  many things going like the  amazing  Battle of Helms  Deep. Frodo  and  Sam journey  to Mount Doom, to destroy the  Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so  creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected  from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should  of  been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>The  Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows  it the ending. The  ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking,  and as Gandalf  the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When  Treebeard and his army of Entz tear  down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so  immense  in  size,  that you   truly have to see to believe.<br/><br/>In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly  redefined  the word \"epic\" and he also   pays attention to the  small things that truly elevate this  movie from  great to amazing. I definitely  recommend this film to  everyone,  but you  really  should watch the first  movie to truly understand what's going on.<br/><br/>10/10",
    "The imaginative but well-conceived idea of dishing up a romance upon lovers communicating spiritually owing to one of them  is dead, was first filmed by  Steven  Spielberg 8 months before  the Ghost's silver screen release. Spielberg's movie Always(1989) had classy use of visuals fulfilling  the needs  of viewers with mystery-based  expectations. Yet, Always lacked the sense of essential  romance  concept, despite  having the same plot and even the same storyline in Ghost. Originally the   idea has been created  by Chandler Sprague and David Boehm.<br/><br/>However, Ghost accomplished  of what \"Always\" tried and failed to accomplish. Thanks  to the  great acting trio of Patrick Swayze + Demi Moore +  Whoopi  Goldberg, for   together they registered  indelible moments into Ghost. It  is scraped  in our memory how  in time Molly and  Sam happen to keep their thoughts off each  others' feelings, and that taught us: \"Love begins with emotions, ends  with thoughts\". On  this  account  they never called off their faith on believing  that they  will keep an  enduring  love affair. These indelible  scenes in  Ghost  are conceptually cut  where  the editing was so impressive that instead of trying to make the story more plausible, it empowered  the devotion of lovers onto their relation.  The scene which Sam's ghost drew upon Oda Mae's body to break the longing with Molly by kissing her is   an imperishable cinematic instant. <br/><br/>I was  in love with someone, and it  was February,2005; we were  both watching  the Ghost on   TV, both  talking on the phone. Then that  scene came upon(Sam's ghost kissing Molly in Oda Mae's  body),  I  felt lost deep in my heart seeking the girl  I'm talking on the phone. I  heard she was crying and  sobbing, and keep saying to me: \"I will never  forget the first time you kissed me and I don't  need to be alive to  recall this\" Ghost is one timeless  romantic masterpiece that had  its moments. For me the kissing  scene  was the best kiss in movies of all time. MTV had honoured this kiss as well, several years after  the release of  the movie, as the best kiss in '90s. Superimposing  that,  the scenes where Oda Mae  Brown convinces Molly that Sam's ghost is around  her and then Molly  reasons  with police that  Oda Mae knows what nobody is able to know but Sam  and herself only, are the scenes that  deliver  the magic beyond eyes and  beyond  ears.<br/><br/>To watch  Ghost is in the to do list of what to    do  when you're on a date.",
    "Dinosaurs. Amusement Park. Tourists. Disaster.<br/><br/>Jurassic World has them all.<br/><br/>Naturally,  I  had to see it.<br/><br/>The  beginning holds much promise, and it gets your hopes up for the disaster to come. When it does, there are  some great action sequences, especially ones with the glass ball containing the soft, chewy child centre.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the   final act  unravels into outright farce.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt is great  as the affable yet  bad-ass Raptor Whisperer. He's got   an  easy going   charisma that could easily  carry an  iconic character like Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard plays Claire Dearing, the  uptight park manager, who  initially  clashes with the laid  back Owen. Of course you know  where  the  tension goes.<br/><br/>The film tries  to flesh out Claire's character by throwing in her two  nephews (someone and another kid), who do double  duty as McGuffins.<br/><br/>Vincent D'Onofrio shows up as  Hoskins, a villainous representative  of the military-industrial complex angling to weaponize velociraptors. He's all sneers and scenery  chewing,  so obviously evil  he's got a goatee. D'Onofrio does it well but the evil plan he's been saddled with by the writers makes no sense at all.<br/><br/>The  director, Colin  Trevorrow, said in interviews that    he wanted the dinosaurs   to act   like    real  animals, not cartoon monsters. Quelle surprise!  I had  no idea, as he has well-fed  winged dinos (or near enough to dinos)  go on a crazed orgy of violence against hapless tourists. Why? Because cool action sequence!<br/><br/>One  poor soul is even treated to the most  outlandishly elongated death  sequence I've  ever seen, all to no  end. It didn't justify anything,  paid nothing back,  offered no comeuppance. It  was just gleeful indulgence in sadistic torture of a  minor character. It  was an Itchy & Scratchy moment.<br/><br/>Which brings us  to the final act: turn off your brain before it begins.<br/><br/>The first movie proved you could have a smart script and dinosaurs in the same movie. After that, the IQ of the series dropped with each outing.  The first   one had  chaos theory and amber and DNA extraction and cleverness up the whazoo. It was AWESOME.<br/><br/>What does  this one have? Hackneyed evil plans, a  clunky plot, and characters so smart they   run  from T-Rex's in  high  heels.<br/><br/>The franchise  has had a lobotomy.

    "It may be true that everyone during their lifetime  has  fifteen  minutes of fame, even if in most cases it only  lasts about a minute  and  a half.  And if that minute and a half comes early in   life, how far  into adulthood can you carry it with you, and when does a healthy memory become an obsession that  finally  blurs  the line between  reality and  fantasy?  `The Fan,' directed by Tony Scott  and starring Robert  De Niro and Wesley Snipes, is an intense and disturbing motion picture that examines that moment  and the  effects it  can have  on the lives of those either  directly or  indirectly involved.  Here, the focus  is  on one Gil Renard (De Niro), a  knife salesman in San Francisco and  a  die-hard Giants fan who is pumped about the acquisition during the off-season of superstar  centerfielder Bobby Rayburn  (Snipes), whom he believes will  bring a pennant to the   team.  Once   a  player himself-- a  pitcher-- Renard's life has since been on a downhill slide.    Divorced,  he   has a young, little league aged   son, Richie  (Andrew   J. Ferchland), with whom he has an unsettling relationship, and at work, his sales have been so poor his job is on the line.  An angry, disturbed  individual, Renard has reached a  pivotal point in his life; for inspiration, he continually returns to the philosophies of the catcher from his playing  days, Coop (Charles Hallahan), whom he considers one of the finest athletes he ever knew.  And as   his  life continues to deteriorate,  his obsessions begin to add further to the imbalance of his perceptions of reality,  which   finally  lead him past a point  of no return.<br/><br/>\tScott's film, of  course,  has less to do with baseball than it does  with how the game itself actually relates  to life and the things that really matter. As Rayburn  says at one point, `We're not curing  cancer here.'  But to   those  to  whom life has been reduced  to  that minute and a half  to which  they still cling, the game  can  be everything.   And it  is just that unhealthy obsession  that Scott examines in  this film, that comparatively insignificant moment that in the obsessive mind  becomes an episode  of  monumental  importance that finally distorts any semblance of reality the  individual   may have left. What's truly frightening is that upon close scrutiny,  in  Renard there is much  with which many  viewers  will be able to  relate in one way or another: The anger, the frustration and perhaps the inability to let  go of that minute and  a  half, even  when it  threatens to become more  than just a pleasant memory, but an unhealthy  lifeline to another place and  another time  that, in  reality, may never  have existed in the  first place.  It's like a search for  self-esteem  by  the has-been-who-never-was, who can neither realize nor  accept it's  elusiveness.  As Renard  says to Richie, `Baseball is better than life, because it's  fair.  You hit a sacrifice fly and it doesn't count against your average.'  An ideal  that has  forever eluded Renard; in  his life, he's never been able to `give himself up for the team' and get anything in  return for it.<br/><br/>\tAs Renard, De Niro  gives an explosive performance that at first glance may seem to have a bit of Travis Bickle  and Max Cady   in it-- which   in  fact it does-- though  upon closer inspection, Renard is a  unique character.   Those  with a disturbed mind may have traits  in common, as   these characters De  Niro has portrayed  certainly do;  but De Niro  has successfully given each of them an individual personality, and when viewed side by side, the differences are  readily apparent.   Bickle may be a sociopath, Cady  a cold blooded killer;   but Renard is a man  who was just never able to get a handle on his life  and has allowed his  obsessions to dictate the choices he has made along the way. De  Niro is simply a  master of  his craft, with  the ability to make his characters so real that  a performance like this  one is often  overlooked; this is Oscar worthy work for which  he  never   received the acclaim he was  due.  His Renard is  so like someone you would run into in your  everyday  life that in retrospect, it's scary.  But it's  the kind  of performance we've come to expect from De  Niro, and as usual,  he does  not disappoint.<br/><br/>\tWesley Snipes,  as well, gives a solid  performance as Rayburn that is one of his best ever, which is not surprising when  you consider with whom he was working.  If you  study  De Niro's films, you may  discover  a common thread running through them with  regard to his co-stars.  De  Niro has the  ability to make those with whom he is  working better; and it's  something  that  stays with them forever after.  Consider Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep before `The Deer Hunter,' or Ed  Harris before `Jacknife.'  Certainly they were exceptional  talents before, but they have arguably been  better since.  And Snipes is no exception.   Nor is Benicio Del  Toro  (Recipient of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for `Traffic'), who gives  a memorable turn here as Rayburn's rival outfielder, Juan Primo.  <br/><br/>\tThe supporting cast includes Patti D'Arbanville (Ellen),Ellen Barkin (Jewel), John Leguizamo (Manny),  Chris Mulkey (Tim), Dan Butler (Garrity) and Brandon Hammond (Sean).  A thought provoking thriller that gives some real  insight into the cause and effect of the psyche of human nature, `The Fan' is like an  open  wound that may hit too close to home  for some.   And to dismiss this as  just a  `baseball'  movie or another `action' flick would be a mistake, for there is much more here than  meets the  eye.   In the end, those who pay attention will ultimately reap  the  rewards  it proffers.  I rate this  one 9/10.",
    "This  review gives everything away, so see the  movie first.<br/><br/>It is  neither allegory nor  satire,  the two finest categories in  both fiction and cinema, and yet   it approaches perfection anyway. It is of a nature   I have no name  for,  but it is a nature that reveals truth and undermines falsehoods. <br/><br/>Nothing is more cloaked in falsehood than the victor's depiction of past wars. It is especially true of the children of the  victors--especially the children of US WWII veterans, like myself.<br/><br/>We get our  view of the war from  movies  like Audi Murphy in To Hell and Back   or Saving Private Ryan.  Nothing but praise  for  our heroes and cheers for killing  the enemy. <br/><br/>But QT exposes this  hypocrisy by engineering  a film where  we are  disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and  then by  the excesses  of our heroes. That is the first  instance. The hypocrisy is slammed home in the  second instance where we are first disgusted by the sight of American  after American being shot  dead  by  by  a German sniper  hero and  secondly brought to revel in the butchery of several hundred enemy  at the  hands of our heroes. Tit for tat.<br/><br/>It fits the pattern  of praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy, but because it   is presented both ways the hypocrisy becomes   self- evident. This is why so many people hate the movie--even  if  they fail to realize it. High art, true art, 10 of 10.  ",

    "Gladiator is  a historical epic from director   Ridley Scott. After being betrayed by the new Caesar, Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he  rises to fame   as a people's champion and finds an  opportunity  to exact his revenge. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver strong performances. Additionally, the gladiator  fights  are especially  dynamic and exciting, featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are  also remarkably well-done, and  create  a  vivid  depiction  of ancient Rome. And,  Hans Zimmer's score  does an excellent job at capturing  the tone of the film. Thrilling and action-packed,  Gladiator delivers a compelling tale.  \"Are you  not entertained?!\"",
    "The Sixth Sense enjoys being     playful with our imagination. What your eyes see is not  exactly what it is. What your  mind paints is not exactly what there is. In the world of  The Sixth Sense logic is your worst  enemy.<br/><br/>There are obvious (and sometimes  less obvious) hints right  in front of you   but you don't grasp  them because of  your preconceptions and premises.  I once read a novel called  'Somewhere carnal over 40 winks' which  used similar techniques found in this movie, but  in   writing. I'm sure  you will  enjoy this book as much as I did, if you like to be  intellectually surprised.<br/><br/>If  you haven't seen this movie, don't read   reviews and don't talk to your friends who have already seen  it. The movie  is very much susceptible to  spoilers.

    "`The Transporter'   is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to  believe anything we are seeing on  screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we  don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since  it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences  without  having to pay the slightest  heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>Jason Statham  literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed  former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions  asked) all  over the  French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the  `package' he is  to deliver happens to be a human being  -  a pretty young Chinese  girl named Lai Kwan who has  been dropped, bound  and gagged,  into  the   trunk of the sporty car  on which he  lavishes most, if not all, of  the love and caring he has to  offer.   Yet,  Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving  indifference,   to be a criminal-type with  a heart of gold,  and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil  an attempt by her  nefarious father   to  sell a crate  load  of Chinese  immigrants into  slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like  `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned  with  attitude and  style than  it is with its storyline, which exists  merely as a vehicle on which to hang  all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action  pictures.   The   movie is well directed,  well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright,  sparkling sheen.    In fact, Morel's camerawork  here is some of the best I  have seen in a film in  a very long  time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham,  who  makes for  a very `cool' action film hero,  Francois  Berleand turns in a wonderful performance   as a  shrewd,   wisecracking police inspector who knows  that Frank is  up to something but  who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the  man the benefit of the doubt.   Qi Shu  is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication'  that  steps into Frank's  smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food -  not high  in nutritional  value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you  don't have the time or    inclination for  something more demanding.   Like  its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",
    "Back to  the Future Part II is an solid sequel to the first one which Back to the Future (1985) is a masterpiece.   This is a fun travel science  fiction comedy in the trilogy. It deals with paradox past traveling. From traveling  with Time machine   Car \"DeLorean\" in to the future  and back to the past again. This film  is a  8 in my opinion it doesn't deserve the hate, like mostly viewers stated.  I love \"Back   to the Future\" trilogy it is one  of my all time favorite trilogy's of all  time. I grew up with this trilogy I  have seen the   first one  on VHS as a kid. Years later I have seen the sequels  on TV. I love this movie  to  death  and it  is my  third favorite film in  the trilogy. Don't get  me wrong but I have enjoyed  Back to  the Future  Part III more than part II and think the third  film  is the most underrated  film   in the trilogy   and unappreciated. This film does have the comedy and  the humor  in it.<br/><br/>I  Love, Love  this film so so so much, it  is a  great direction from Robert   Zemeckis and brilliant writing from Bob Gale.  Back to  the Future Part II  was nominated  for an Oscar.  I really  did missed 21st October 2015 an important event date from  this   film in the trilogy that reached 30 year anniversary  in the year 2015 when the trilogy come out respectfully on a Blu-ray. <br/><br/>Back to the Future Part II (1989)<br/><br/>The story  continues when Doctor Emmett  Brown, Marty  McFly and  Jennifer traveling   in to  the future 2015 to fix   Marty's and  Jennifer's future in  which Marty has  to  save his  son   from been jailed.    His arch  enemy Biff Tannen  steals Marty's  idea and steal's Gray's Sports Almanac only to travel back in to the past November 12, 1955 to change the alternative time  line paradox in which Biff creates the timeline  in the year 1985. The same alternative  timeline and paradox was also used in The Flash Season 3 Episode 1 Flashpoint. <br/><br/>Than the story sets Marty and Doc on the hunt   for a Gray's Sports almanac from Biff in the year 1955 in which Biff is a teenager. The chase and  a race on the road in which Marty is in Biff's  car  try's  to get the Almanac back and Biff crashes  with his car in the  truck of manure is my favorite scene  in  the film. The  Hoverboard  scene in the  future in which Griff chases Marty in the year 2015 and Marty outsmart them in which Griff  and his gang  lands in the court in the opening scene is also my favorite scene  in the film.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox and  Christopher Lloyd are excellent in their performances. Michael J. Fox  plays more   than just one character, he even  played Marlene McFly future   daughter of Marty.<br/><br/>Things I really didn't like  about the film and that  is why it hurts  the film:  the dark  future created I didn't liked. I hated Thomas  F. Wilson's character Biff  trough in tier film he  was  irritating awful  person. I didn't like the death of George McFly. I didn't like Biff marrying Loraine.  Half  of the film was more focusing on Biff than Doc and Marty I hated that idea. I did not like the filmmakers  repeat the first  movie again in the year 1955. They copied the first film I did not like  that idea so  sorry.  I still hate Biff Tannen in this movie so damn much! I did not like the ending in which  Doc  was  hit  by a lightning with \"DeLorean\" and sent back 100 year in the  past. The film didn't had  a  satisfying ending or a happy ending that we wished for. I didn't   like older Marty McFly  he acted like he is stupid in the movie  that is   why I prefer III over this film more. Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover did not  return to reprise  their roles.  I  am surprised that actress Elisabeth Shue accept the  role of Jennifer but she declined  the role for The Karate  Kid Part II weird. <br/><br/>This film get's 8 \"Back to the Future\" is my  favorite trilogy  of all  time and I love  this movie to death. I hope they  don't make Part  IV because  it will be disaster.  It is rated PG for language throughout, some suggestive content and violence. I miss movies like this  they don't make em' like this anymore.",

    "While book racks are   brimming with  thought provoking, high concept science fiction, the movie  genre tends to be populated  by invading aliens, intergalactic wars, and  adventure, which makes Director and co-writer Duncan Jones' Moon that  much more  of an oddity.<br/><br/>Not since Steven Soderbergh's much overlooked 2002 rendition  of Stanislaw Lem's Solaris has a movie  firmly rooted in   the sci-fi realm delivered reflections on  the human condition, which Moon does deftly.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), the only inhabitant of  an automated lunar mining base extracting Helium-3 from lunar rocks to  be shipped back  to Earth to fuel  the energy starved  planet.<br/><br/>Sam's isolated three year posting  is  about to come to an end and he longs  to return to Earth to see his wife. His only  company throughout this sojourn has  been that of  Gerty,  the base's HAL-like robot voiced by Kevin Spacey. Unfortunately, the final weeks  and days  are proving to be the most difficult, and Sam finds himself going a bit squirrelly, leaving both he and the audience  to wonder if what's unfolding is actually happening, or merely a drama  taking place in his addled  mind.<br/><br/>That's  about as much   plot detail as I'm going to  deliver, for  to delve any    deeper into the story  would  give too much away.  Be prepared,  however, for a thought provoking narrative that touches on issues such  as  scientific  ethics, corporate greed, human identity, and compassion.<br/><br/>There are no aliens, lasers/phasers, wormholes, warp  engines or jump   drives here, just a  lonely space age concierge, an unflappable monotone robot, and a whole   lot  of fodder for your brain  to chow down  on.<br/><br/>This is what science fiction  was meant to be.",
    "Beyond its compelling  subject matter \"Judgement At Neuremberg\" revolutionizes the court room drama  genre. The camera   swings and swerves and dives between the lines of  this exemplary Abby Mann script. Stanley Kramer  conducts his orchestra of iconic stars with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker.  The language barriers and the confinement of the action masterfully resolved. Spencer Tracy is simply magnificent and, as per usual, we believe every word that  comes out of his mouth.   His judge  is    an American monument  of unsentimental     humanity. Twentynine year  old  Maimilian  Schell won  the  Oscar as  best actor and  his performance survived the test of time  with the vigor of his conviction. Montgomery Cliff makes his short minutes on  the screen, one  of those memorable moments that nobody that  has  ever seen it will be able to forget. The man and the character merging into one chilling, shattering truth. \"I  am half the man I've ever been\" Marlene   Dietrich gives to her German aristocrat a  legendary star quality. And Judy Garland, overweight and almost unrecognizable breaks your heart and gets her last  Oscar  nomination. My  only troubles came with the stoic  Burt  Lancaster because I could  never forget  it was Burt Lancaster and with Richard  Widmark's strident prosecutor. I have  seen \"Judgement At Neuremberg\" more than a dozen times and it never ceases to amaze me that no matter the darkness of  the subject it  always manages to entertain and inspire. ",

    "Many people were  disappointed with 'Jackie Brown' when it was first released as it didn't live  up to  their expectations  created by the more flamboyant 'Reservoir  Dogs' and  'Pulp Fiction'.  I admit that I  was one of those disappointed fans.  But as the years have gone by I have  come to appreciate this movie more and more, and if you deal with what it IS and not what you thought it was going to be, you'll see  that it is an underrated  gem of a  movie. 'Jackie Brown' is much more character driven and leisurely  plotted than Tarantino's previous   two movies.  I haven't read the Elmore  Leonard  novel on which it was based  so I can't tell whether this was  a  conscious  decision by Tarantino himself, or it's because   of the source material,  but it   might  be a stumbling  block  for  those with MTV-style attention spans. 1970s  crime movie  buffs will  find it much easier going. The big names in the cast like De Niro, Jackson and Fonda are  all very good, but the real standout performances in this movie are by 70s  blaxploitation icon Pam Grier ('Coffy', 'Foxy  Brown', 'Black   Mama White Mama',etc.etc.)  and a revelatory  one from Robert  Forster. Forster back in the day showed plenty of  promise in movies  like 'Medium Cool' but quickly found himself stuck in b-grade  exploitation    movies like 'Vigilante'  and  'Alligator'. Fun stuff, but hardly Oscar material. Max Cherry is  the best role he   has ever  been given, and he is superb in it. The fascinating thing  about 'Jackie Brown' for me is that Tarantino's critics accuse him of making shallow and violent self-consciously hip crime films, but the  central story of  this  movie concerns  an inter-racial  Middle Aged  romance, something I haven't seen done in a  believable  or realistic fashion by Hollywood before. By doing  this so well Tarantino shows he has  much more depth,  and  is a much more interesting  and braver  film maker than his more acclaimed contemporaries. 'Jackie Brown' is a fine movie that hopefully one day will get the kudos it deserves. Don't overlook this one just because it isn't 'Pulp Fiction The Next Generation'! ",
    "Unbeknowist  to me, Over the  Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but  I can  only imagine that it  would be just as good  as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I  can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Bruce  Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life  when he tries to steal the huge supply  of food  that Vincent (Nick Nolte),   a bear, has stored during his winter  hibernation.  Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a  week    to collect all  the food and everything that went with it,  or  he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs.  In  the  neighbouring forest, he finds a  \"family\"  of  animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They  are all searching   for food as well, so R.J.   helps teach them things  about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets   out to get the  food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the main premise of  the film, but it takes a   few  turns as all animated films do. And like many animated  films before it, it has  a  great message, and  is great for kids and adults. The  film  is packed with light  laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs  for the adults. At the  heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only  touches on being satirical  in this sense,  it does offer the usual  pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song  and dance number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then  it ends.  It is not as short   as some films, but you  can't help but  wonder what more   could  have been done if they had  a little  more running time. It is a  much stronger  film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark  Tale, and really seems like it  can  stand next  to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice  acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense  raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell  also stands out as the absolutely insane  Hammy the squirrel, as does William   Shatner as Ozzie the  possum. As  I had read before seeing the film, Shatner  does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did  something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents  of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as  a skunk,  to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to  Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all  are  great and  well  suited for their roles.  They all have quite a bit  of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse  of Ben  Stiller and no one  else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little  bizarre, you can  see  that she is at least making   an attempt at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as  usual, the  animation is excellent.  While not being a   total  improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks  films,  the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures,   all of them are  perfectly captured, and  look  gorgeous on film. All the  colours are great too.<br/><br/>It's  a  funny movie,  and a fabulous cast. It's one of   the better animated  films  of  the last few  months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "Everyone acts very well, and the whole film would have been really  good if it hadn't been for this weird narrator the whole way through  who sounded  like he was telling children a   story even  when  saying things like \"they went to bed together\".  It was weird.  I  also feel if it had been more dialogue based we could  have got a greater grasp of the characters. I watched it without subtitles  but understood the  relationship of Juan Antonio and his ex-wife (mostly spoken in Spanish)   than  I did of Doug and Vicky which just  seemed to lack a  huge  amount of depth. There needed to be some redeeming feature  Vicky  and Doug's   relationship.<br/><br/>Anyway well  acted but yeah the narrator ruins it.  Javier Bardem is amazing as usual.",
    "The  third film about the   young wizard is the most controversial, for it  was   he who split the fans of the novels about Potter into two warring parties: conservatives and innovators.<br/><br/>The  first   group of fans absolutely condemned and condemned the actions of the director Cuaron, altered  \"Harry Potter\" in his own way. Say,  they did not like the strange werewolf, all sorts of jokes-jokes, interspersed by the director in addition to the script, and in addition to all   the claims they discovered the disappearance of the atmosphere of magic, because of  which the popular expression of \"Quaron in  the  furnace\" was born.<br/><br/>The second group, on the   contrary, furiously began to praise Cuaron, extolling  him to the unprecedented pedestal of fame, thus creating  almost a cult of personality.  They liked everything that  only they  could like in the  third film.<br/><br/>Only now it became clear that both sides are not right in their convictions. So it should be,   movies must  be different in essence. The error crept in  from the very   beginning:  Chris Columbus took the first  two  films, and this put the old debate on what kind of  movies Harry Potter  should be about. Columbus did not have to give  the right to shoot two films,  and one would suffice. Spectators are used to the atmosphere of  the  first two films, because most of  the audience took   the innovative approach of Quaron to  the screen version of the third novel with bayonets. Now the producers make  a mistake again -  they give  the right to shoot two  films (The Order  of the Phoenix and  The Half-Blood  Prince) to the new director David Yates.   This should not be done in any case. It is necessary  to preserve the diversity of director's visions.   Hogwarts is not accidentally depicted in different ways  in films, like Hogsmeade.  Everything in novels is  seen differently  every time,  because  all the  reader and viewer sees through the  eyes  of Harry Potter, and in films  through the prism  of the director's vision,  the viewer must perceive the magical world through  the eyes of  a young wizard.\nAlfonso Cuaron still hit the spot with his timely vision of the plot of \"The Prisoner  of Azkaban.\"<br/><br/>He created a sparkling tragicomedy for the growing up of a young wizard.<br/><br/>In general, Cuaron's film reminds me of our old Soviet films. For the reason that the whole film  can be easily taken away on the shots,  quotes, fragments, heroes, soundtracks, etc.,  etc.\nDespite everything,   this   film is much kinder than the previous two, differing in their gloomy Gothic style. It's more fun, crazy, and  it should be, because it's Sirius Black himself on the scene!<br/><br/>For the whole of Rowling's   novel, like the film of Quaron, is a tribute  to the memory of the  crazy,  hooliganistic  and such  lonely Sirius Black ...   Black, whose heart is beating violently, hot  blood flows  in his veins, and in  the soul is truly dog devotion.\nThe third  film, as  well as the film, is dedicated to the looters - James  Potter (= Harry Potter), Peter Pettigrew, Rimus Lupine and Sirius Black  -  a group of friends who  used  to be friends a long  time ago ...<br/><br/>The film ruthlessly shows how easy it is to lose    friendship and how difficult it  is to acquire a friend ...<br/><br/>Thanks to Alfonso Cuaron,  who  did a talented work, showing in  one stroke all the huge gallery of   the characters   of the  magical world  and    their essence: the Minister  of Magic  plunges into a  puddle; the soothsayer with big glasses on her nose stumbles on   her  own table; The evil teacher Severus  Snape closes the children from  the werewolf; eccentric Dumbledore slams his hand over  Ron's gnarled leg; Remus Lupine, at the lesson, takes a snack  with   an apple; portraits of Hogwarts, it turns out, also like to sleep; Stan Shanpike with his brave words is  not  very strong in dragging student suitcases;  Hagrid  and ties are incompatible things; Tom from the Leaky Cauldron has a nehyl auto; Ernie, wearing  spectacles  with large lenses,  is led by the \"Night Knight\"; Sirius Black finally began to talk moral nonsense ...\nAlso it is necessary to  thank the  new actors, so  successfully merged into the  old  line-up:<br/><br/>Emma Thompson (Sibyl Trelawney); Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore); David Thulis (Remus  Lupine); Julie Christie  (Madame Rosmerta); Gary Oldman (Sirius Black); Timothy Spall (Peter Pettigrew) and many others. By the  way, if my memory  does not change me, then the two actors from the third film (cleaning  woman  in  the bar \"Leaky Cauldron\" and Aunt Marge) Quaron quietly consigned to his other project -  \"Child of Man\", but  that's another  story ...<br/><br/>Let me love the fourth film about Harry Potter (director - Mike  Newell), but  I always revise   the Curaron part - it is  the brightest of all  existing.<br/><br/>In a  word,  long live Rowling  and Cuaron!<br/><br/>\"Potter, come back!\"   (Severus Snape,  potions  teacher).",
    "Terry Gilliam's fantastic, twisted story of a virus destroying all but a handful of people across the Earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather  information about it  is a fantastic,  dizzying, and highly stylized film that boasts Bruce Willis'  best performance ever.<br/><br/>What sets 12   Monkeys  apart from  most  time-travel sci-fi movies is that Bruce Willis     character actually deals with what the psychological effects of  time-travel,  that is, not knowing what reality is actual  reality: the place that the  time-traveler comes from  or goes to.    Also, the film recognizes that things that have past  cannot be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event, in this  case   the release of  said virus,  cannot be  stopped or changed.  As Willis   asserts \"It's already  happened,\" while he's in a mental  hospital, the major dilemma the film trudges  into is not a trite, overdone plot to save the world;  instead  it's  Willis' inner struggle  to simply  survive himself.  It's  a fresh,   innovative concept, and  it works beautifully thanks to a tautly written script by Peoples and Gilliam's unique brand of   dementia.<br/><br/>Besides this, 12 Monkey's storytelling  is totally non-linear and instead opts  to distort and bend the way the story is told skillfully incorporating a bevy  of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the  present, the past,  the future, and even a  scene that is lifted out  of Hitchcock's Vertigo.  All   serve to envelop the viewer into its  disturbing  cacophony of madness and futility.<br/><br/>Visually, Gilliam is a master of  desolate   umbrage and  shadow rivalling Tim Burton  in his strikingly  despondent scenery and imagery.  With  cold, wide,  and  immersing cinematography, Gilliam  plunges into the colorless surroundings  and darkness  of his characters.  The scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, dead  white and help serve as a contrast to the often  veering-on-madness characters.<br/><br/>Performance-wise,  Brad Pitt steals most  scenes, filling  them with a patented loony,  off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him  an Oscar  nomination.  As mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard  hero and instead  portraying Cole as a simple, poignant, tragic everyman.   Equally good  is Madeline Stowe as  Willis' psychologist.   She holds her own, injecting her character with both wild energy and strength  as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to believe   is a false 'religion.'<br/><br/>Gilliam's expert, overwhelming, and complex  handling  of what could have been a routine action/sci-fi film  makes 12 Monkeys  a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape.  Its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline  along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding,  bleak cinematography make it a  masterpiece  of madness.   Ranking in my top 10 of all time,  12 Monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle  of a film  brimming with brilliance.<br/><br/>10  out of 10 ",
    "One  of the early scenes in \"Pulp Fiction\" features  two hit-men discussing what  a Big  Mac is called  in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two  thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume  these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way  to  work.  Other  than the comic payoff at the  end  of  the scene,  in which they use parts of this  conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in  the film, or to anything  else, for  that matter.  Yet without  such scenes, \"Pulp  Fiction\" wouldn't be \"Pulp Fiction.\" I  get the sense that Tarantino put into the film  whatever struck his fancy, and somehow  the final product is not  only coherent but wonderfully  textured.<br/><br/>It's no wonder that fans spend so much time  debating what was in  the suitcase, reading far  more into the  story than Tarantino probably  intended. The film is so intricately  structured, with so many  astonishing details,   many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems   to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. \"Pulp Fiction,\" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in  technique and style, albeit a  brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous  references   to  other films, it is like a great work  of abstract art, or \"art  about art.\" It has all the characteristics we  associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've   ever  seen in a  film. But  to  what end? The self-contained story does not seem   to have bearing on  anything but itself.<br/><br/>The movie becomes a bit easier  to  understand once you realize that it's essentially a black  comedy dressed up as a crime  drama. Each of the three main story  threads begins with a situation that  could  easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something  always goes   wrong, some  small unexpected accident   that causes  the whole situation to come tumbling  down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to  focus  on small details and follow them  where  they lead, even if they move the story away from  conventional plot developments.<br/><br/>Perhaps no  screenplay has ever  found   a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character  ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have  simply told Yolanda,  \"Be cool and  no  one's going to get hurt,\"   which  is just the  type  of  line you'd find in a generic,  run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead,  he  goes off   on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every  word  of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and  infusing  the dialogue  with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are  full of intelligent  observations  about human behavior. Think of Mia's  statement to Vincent, \"That's when you know you've found somebody special:  when  you can just shut  the f---  up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.\"<br/><br/>What is the movie's purpose exactly?  I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power.  Marsellus  is the sort of character who looms over  the  entire film while being invisible  most of  the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the  film,  is the power that Marsellus has over  his men without even  being present. This  power is what gets Vincent   to act in ways  you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb,  stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman  whose husband has gone  away. The power theme also  helps explain  one  of the more controversial aspects of the film, its  liberal use of the  N-word. In  this film, the  word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for  instance, at one  point applies the term to Vincent.  It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter  the word  to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters  are  not racist in practice. Indeed, they  are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses  the  habits of many  law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to  racial epithets because it's a patter  that establishes  their  separateness from the   non-criminal world.<br/><br/>There's a  nice moral progression  to the stories. We presume that  Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia  out of fear rather than loyalty.  Later, Butch's  act of heroism could be  motivated by honor, but we're never  sure. The  film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the  movie seems to be exploring whether violent   outlaws can act  other than for self-preservation.<br/><br/>Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None  of the stories are really \"about\"  anything. They  certainly  are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels  like a tale that didn't  need to be  told, but for whatever reason this  movie  tells  it  and does a better job than  most films of its kind, or of any  other kind.",
    "I've been writing reviews for  IMDb for ten years, and I think something fishy is going on here. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is getting very, very  high reviews from the vast majority of IMDb  reviewers -- but the nine and  ten-  star reviews are all getting pelted with \"negative\"  marks, earning scores of \"1 out  of 15\" likes.<br/><br/>So what's the problem? The problem  is that this movie wasn't  supposed to be a  hit. The mass audience wasn't supposed to  respond to the story of young black men  facing  oppression and coming out on top. The  American people were not supposed to see the  real truth  about how  their police  treat minorities every day.  <br/><br/>Quick, let's  bury the good reviews!   Let's  spawn a phony   backlash! Let's discredit Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on the basis of things they did twenty years  ago. Oh, and let's all get sentimental about Eazy E because he's dead, and young  black men are  okay once they're dead. The dead ones are   no longer scary  and threatening. <br/><br/>The problem with this movie is  that the people  who made it actually dared to portray young,  angry black men   as heroic, not as criminals or predators. It's okay to glamorize white criminals,   because Hollywood was built on that. From  PUBLIC ENEMY to THE GODFATHER, white audiences have always loved to sentimentalize their own  criminals. But you   can't  do that  with  black men who rap about crime, even when they  aren't actually criminals themselves. When Cagney postures like a thug in some ancient piece of crap that's cool. But when  black men do it today that's dangerous and irresponsible!<br/><br/>There are very powerful elements in  this country that are terribly frightened  by this movie.  They're  frightened because this  movie  gets white audiences to see young black men as something other than  dangerous criminals.  The scenes of  NWA being roughed  up by police are a terrible  threat to the powerful elements in our  society, who stay in power  only by keeping white people scared of  black men. They  can't  tolerate the idea of black male victims, so they instantly start a media backlash portraying the victims as criminals.<br/><br/>I say this is a good movie, a powerful,  exciting film  that presents a side of American life that  is  almost  never  seen on  the screen.  I  know I'm not going to get   many likes for  this review, but  what the hell.   <br/><br/>I've got enough  already. ",
    "In all  honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends because he  kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it was   free, and with no expectations. However,  the Notebook drew me into the story  from the beginning right  up until the credits- and then kept me crying  for quite  some time after it  had ended. I, along  with almost every  other person  i have discussed the movie with, felt  involved in the situations and  the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments  and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general,  love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this  movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and  delivered twists  throughout  the  whole  film.The Notebook was  extremely well constructed and  i would   give it an  eleven out of ten.",
    "Yeah  you heard me... Footloose  is based on a TRUE STORY. Unlikely  as   it seems, it really happened  in the small town of Elmore  City,  Oklahoma in 1980. My dad,  Leonard Coffee (a.k.a. Ren McCormack a.k.a. Kevin Bacon...all breakfast items? what a  coincidence...lol) was a  junior at  Elmore City High   School. This  was  a minuscule town, with  a population of around 750, and there were about 50 or   so Baptist churches...so naturally the town's rules  and regulations were a bit extreme. There  was an archaic  town ordinance that banned dancing in public, and it hadn't  been abolished. Elmore had never  had a junior/senior prom! So  my dad fought the system with the help of his best  friend, Rex Kennedy (the junior class president), and they were allowed to have a prom for the first time, and  Elmore has had prom every year since.  I  don't know  who sold the story, but unfortunately we got no money  lol!  There were a few things in the movie that didn't actually happen (Ariel  Moore,  Reverend Moore,  the book  burning, oh and playing chicken on the tractors!), but it is  mostly accurate. The kids did  have to  go to  surrounding communities like Pauls Valley and Lindsay to dance and   party, and my dad drove the exact same car that Ren drives in the movie! So there you  have it, the REAL  story of  Footloose.  If you haven't seen it...watch it! ",
    "When people watch the Oscars, they don't usually care about  the Best Foreign Film nominees. Incendies provides so many reasons why  people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is  the kind of film that one walks  away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays  in the viewer's  mind for days on  end. Like an intense  personal experience, it takes  a  lot  to come to grips with the  film's story, a  moving plot full of  twists and catharsis. At the  New Directors/New  Films  Festival in  New  York,  at which  I saw  this last night, Denis Villeneuve  explained that he  has made  four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no  reason  why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn't have a great future ahead of  them.<br/><br/>Based on the play  Scorched by Wajdi Mouawad, Incendies  follows a  non-linear plot that  spans two generations. In the  present day, Jeanne and Simon are  twins who have lost their  mother, Nawal. Nawal  has  stipulated in her will that Jeanne and Simon  must return an envelope to the brother they didn't know existed who  is currently living in   a  fictional Middle Eastern country. Only   then can the twins give Nawal a proper burial. Jeanne feels obligated to return the  letter, so  she goes   to  the Middle  East, only to realize some of Nawal's  nastiest secrets. As Jeanne uncovers more about Nawal,  the  viewer is shown  Nawal's story. The  film builds up to an unforgettable ending that is sure to rock any  viewer.<br/><br/>Incendies already had great source material. I've praised  the plot enough,   but one  thing  I must add is that the play is apparently four hours  long, according to Villeneuve. It's impressive that this movie succeeds  so  nicely because I can't imagine that anything was cut. But  to  back up that source material, there's   some  really great acting. The entire  cast plays their parts with such an emotional vigor that it seems impossible that this work of art wasn't autobiographical.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Villeneuve has made  a film that relies on great filmmaking to impact the viewer. The cinematography is  beautifully bland, surely a  nod to some of the  deserts  in the  Lebanon-  like land where the movie takes place. Color scheme is also used to Villeneuve's advantage to  show the parallels between Nawal and Jeanne's lives. Villeneuve seems to love working with extended zoom shots that shock the viewer  with their overwhelmingly long silences.  Why Villeneuve didn't receive critical acclaim (in  America,  at least)  before Incendies  is a  mystery.<br/><br/>There  are many movies about the Middle East. Some have failed miserably in their attempts  to   strike an emotional chord with critics and viewers alike  (Redacted, Rendition), but others have  been extremely successful (The  Hurt Locker, Lebanon).  Incendies could very well be one of the best  films  ever made  about the conflicts  in the Middle East.  It has its  flaws which  keep it  from being a masterpiece (maybe it could've lost five or ten minutes), but it is that rare type of film that really   resonates beyond  the initial viewing. Hopefully, Incendies will be  remembered for years  to come as the little, brilliant film that spawned the  great fame  of Denis Villeneuve.",

    "With workers striking in Russia,  the crew of the  battleship Potemkin feel a  certain kinship for  the plight of their brothers. When they are served rotting, maggot infested meat some of the crew  object, only  to  find themselves singled out and  placed in front of a   firing   squad. With the marines seconds away from firing the deadly shots,  ordinary seaman Grigory Vakulinchuk steps into the breach and intervenes to   save the men  by appealing to the firing squad to ignore  their orders. When the officers take  their revenge and  kill Vakulinchuk, all are  bonded together in the struggle; a bond  that reaches to the city of Odessa where the  rebellion grows, leading to a bloody and historic  series  of events.<br/><br/>It is hard to imagine that  anybody who has seen quite  a  few films in the   past few decades would be unaware of this film, but  it is  perhaps understandable that  fewer have had  the opportunity to actually sit  down and watch. I had  never  seen this film before but had  seen  countless references  to  it in  other films and therefore considering it  an  important film to at least see once. The story is based on real events and this only serves to make it more interesting but even without this  context  it is still an engaging story.  The story  doesn't have much in the way of characters but it still brings out the brutality and injustice of events and it is in this that it hooked me   surprisingly  violent (implied more  than modern  gore)  it demonising the actions and shows innocents falling  at all sides in  key scenes. The version I saw apparently  had the original score (I'm not being snobby  modern rescores could be better for all I know) and I felt it worked  very well to match and improve the film's mood; dramatic, gentle or exciting,  it all  works very well.<br/><br/>The feel of the film was a surprise to me because it stood up  very  well viewed with my modern  eyes.  At one  or two points the model work was very  clearly model work but mostly the film  is  technically impressive.  The masses of extras, use of  ships and cities and just the  way it  captures such  well organised chaos are all very  impressive and would be even  done  today. What is more impressive  with time though is how the film has a very strong  and very  clean style to it  it is not as gritty and flat as many silent films of the period that  I have seen; instead   it is very crisp  and feels very, very professional. Of course watching  it in  2004  gives me the  benefit of hindsight where  I  can  look back over many films that have referenced  the images or directors who have mentioned the  film in  interviews; but even without this 20:20 vision it is still possible to see how well done the film is  and to note how memorable much of it is   the  steps and the firing  squad scenes are two very impressive  moments that are very memorable. The only real thing that might bug modern audiences is the acting;  it isn't  bad but silent acting is  very different from acting with sound. Here the actors all    over act  and  rely on their bodies    to do much of their delivery   word cards just  don't do  the emotional job so they have   to make extra effort to deliver this.<br/><br/>Overall this is a classic film that  has  influenced  many modern directors. The story is engaging  and   well worth hearing; the  directing is crisp and  professional, producing many scenes that linger in  the  memory; the music works to deliver  the emotional  edge that modern audiences  would normally  rely  on acting and dialogue to deliver and the whole film is  over all too quickly! An essential piece of cinema for those that claim to love the  media but   also a cracking good film in its own right.",
    "The best  film in the era of Daniel Craig as  James Bond. Supremely well  acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize. Great action scenes, big issue that touches past  Bond  and  M  which little  is known. Sam Mendes does  a  masterful job directing this installment of James Bond. Realmete  with this film you can   compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly.",
    "I've seen the movie just a bit earlier  and although my expectations were very  high,  this movie satisfied me very well. As  we  already know  Turkish movie sector has lack of visual effects. That is actually the reason behind why  we usually don't enjoy Turkish  Action kind of films. But in this movie we  see lots of great examples of best visual  effects. And  also it has its own realistic scenes as well. The connection between  soldiers were so great, enthusiastic and natural.  Also  the connection between the first movie  with this one was  great so this movie  actually deserves its rate.  Besides from good visual and sound effects the movie has also  its own  story-line which was perfect. As I  mentioned before even  though my expectations were   really high this movie is even  beyond my  expectations. Thanks  for letting us joy this  kind  of masterpiece Mr. Alper Caglar.",
    "I have never  written a review here, but I felt compelled to  actually step up and  defend  this movie.<br/><br/>The   Bourne  Legacy  was  everything I expected it to be. It  couldn't  be too close to the previous Bourne films,   but had to be close enough to let us know a storm is coming.<br/><br/>Bourne's presence  throughout  the film is  what spins this story   into action and I felt it  was balanced  perfectly.  We all want Bourne, but this is Aaron Cross's story. Renner and  Weisz were great, but I think the scripting has been  derided by many as terrible. I had  no issues with anything and even felt compelled by Renner's character motivation.   This  was someone yearning to be more, not someone who was already better than everyone else, but just couldn't remember.<br/><br/>Let's  cross our  fingers and hope  we all get what we want and pair Bourne and Cross  in the  next film.<br/><br/>There is so much more going on than  just Jason Bourne and if we don't get to explore that then the franchise will  be  poorer for it!",
    "This is the raunchiest of the Scary Movies. If  you thought the  original was \"too much\", well,  this one will truly  give you more reasons to avoid it for it's vulgar content and crude sex jokes. That's for  you,  easily  offended people. <br/><br/>I had  a  great time with it when it first came out in theaters. I  really liked    the crude sex humor and  vulgar spoofs. So for those who are  into sex jokes and  scatological humor, you  will be amused.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is truly hilarious and in my opinion, the best part  of the movie. It was about time that the  \"Scary  Movie\" franchise had an Exorcist spoof! It was  great.  James Woods in the role of  Father Merrin delivers a hysterical performance relying  most of his   scenes  on scatological humor and profanity. For example,  when  Reagan  says \"f*** me\" and he immediately jumps into her and simulates to be penetrating  her.  Another example is the line where Reagan's mother says \"she won't even let me touch her!\" and the priest responds \"yeah sometimes  that happens, you  have to give candy to the children\"  (or something like that);  obviously referring to recent pederastry cases. On  the other side,  the movie also has \"classical\" but always effective teen  humor . For example,  when entering the room for the first time, he  gets  scared  and runs away when Reagan turns her head  on 180º; and the always effective  vomiting cycle. <br/><br/>After  the Exorcist  spoof, the movie centers on the Poltergeist and Entity spoofs. That's  when the movie  takes  a  new direction and does not changes from it. Expect spoofs  from  popular t.v. commercials, songs (Vitamin C), and even racist and homophobic jokes. The sex  jokes  worth a watch specially on the infamous clown scene, and the sex  ghost. <br/><br/>\"Scary  Movie 2\"  does not \"cross\" the  line  on the vulgar  factor. It's just a good rated R movie with spoofs for all tastes;  of course, if you are not easily offended. But be  sure to watch  it on DVD;  do not watch the t.v.  version because it's very cut (specially on  dialogs).<br/><br/>This  is in my   opinion the best  of the  \"Scary Movies\".",
    "Don't look at the movie  the  way it is. You can hate  it for whatever reasons you like  but this  movie isn't  just stupid, soulless  and pointless  sexual fantasy. There is  more thought put into it than you could ever imagine.  Too bad critics panned the movie  for the things that  couldn't comprehend and the  audience went with it.<br/><br/>The  whole thing  is a big fantasy that  does not exist or happening in the real  world.  The movie is actually about Sweet Pea(Abbie Cornish). She is the star of the show. Snyder made  that  very  clear from  the start. Babydoll(Emily Browning) is a figment of Sweet  Pea's imagination. She is  the physical embodiment of Sweet  Pea. She is the 5th thing. She is the guardian angel that Sweet Pea created to deal with her trash  life.  The entire film is a reflection  of the internal struggle  of Sweet Pea. That's why she  is the one   who's  narrating the film. The stuff that we've  seen  with Babydoll during the first  act,  that's all  Sweet Pea acting out her  past trauma in  her mind, just as she was taught to do in the mental institution. That's why the movie opens on a stage that direct parallel  to how Sweet  Pea is  acting out that same trauma on a stage when Babydoll first arrives in the mental institution aka the theater. After  that, the lobotomy comes, the key to everything that happens  in  the movie.  Reimagined through Babydoll  perspective, Sweet Pea disassociates from  reality when the needle plunges into  her brain, retreating into her mind in the same  way  she's taught to by Dr. Gorski. She's not in the real world anymore. This is  also what happened in Sweet Pea's real life. And the effect of that  lobotomy is the goddamned movie. Yes, this movie is the  result of a  lobotomy. Just one big subconscious coping mechanism for Sweet Pea to find peace. And  this  girl is  able to interrupt the  lobotomy, intruding on her own  story.  She's even able to repurpose the accidental killing   of her sister into a deliberate and necessary  sacrifice on her sister's part to save her. In this second layer of fantasy, Sweet Pea  imagines  herself and the rest  of the girls working in a brothel, objectified and lusted  after by an audience. This mirrors us  tuning   in to see   these girls perform for us in various outfits. This connection is made clear from the opening  of the film, which lets us know that we're  the audience watching all this  unfold  on stage. By choosing to watch the movie, we are   complicit in everything  that's happening.  Of course, this  doesn't mean to condemn you for wanting to see nubile  girls kicking ass. What this movie is really about is the difference  between  empowerment and exploitation. This is  represented through three layers of fantasy,  first was the mental institution,  second  is the brothel,  third is the fantasy-action scenes,  each  exploring  a different set of social values, each aligning with different phases of the  feminist  movement. First up   is a grim incarnation of the '60s -the mental  institution- set  during the second wave of the feminist movement,  when gender inequality was much more widespread. That gender inequality is amplified in the   second   world -the brothel-  which takes us back even further, to  a time when   women were literally  treated like property. And finally we have the pop culture world -the  world  of today, action scenes- which imagines Babydoll's dancing through various aspects of modern geek culture, dressing the girls up in all the typical fetishistic attire we've come to expect   video games,  TV, movies,  etc... Sweet Pea  is aware of  how sick  this is and rejects that Baby Doll's dancing could possibly be empowering.  It's only through seeing its effect on men does she  start  to see how  much  power they really have,  as the girls start  taking  back the  control  they've lost by using men's objectification of  them to  their  advantage. By embracing their sexuality instead of fearing it,  they learn  that  their inherent femininity can be better used as  a means of holding men under their sway. Suddenly, it's the  men who  become  helpless instead of them. Point  being, men may be   in a position to physically overpower women, but women have  the power to psychologically overpower men, thus  inverting   history's long-standing  power dynamic between men and women.  This is then mirrored to very much the same effect in the   action fantasy scenarios -  a  symbolic gesture  on Snyder's part to show women taking back  geek culture,  which  men have  been dominating with their boy club mentality and pervasive misogyny  for far  too   long. This  is demonstrated further  once  we  cut back to Babydoll's lobotomy after Sweet Pea has found peace. While Sweet Pea busy imagining that she's taking the magic school bus to  a better world, Blue   has plans  of his own. But its   no  use, she's already escaped, even if it's  only  mentally. Sweet Pea  sacrifices her body -Babydoll- and retreats into the comfort  of her own mind, a paradise over which nobody has control of  but her.  Blue may have control over her body, but without her mind, he has nothing. The importance of this  is also apparent during Babydoll's encounter with the    High  Roller, who  recognizes that the choice   to truly be with  someone lies with you and   you  alone. As the  scene with the High Roller  reaffirms, the distinction between exploitation and empowerment all comes down to personal  choice.  And that is just half of the point this movie trying to make. Women deserve just as much control over  their  bodies as they have over their minds.  You can interpret this movie so many ways, it's beyond belief. It gives you  so many options to think. It's really funny that the one who made this  kind of a movie and the one who is trying to defend it is a  male. But it is what it is. If this  movie made  by  someone like Stanley Kubrick, probably everyone would have tried to  decipher the depth of it and wouldn't  have even minded the bad reviews.<br/><br/>It's really sad that people turn off  their brains  and see everything  literal, and never uses their brain to read  the images that appear  on the screen when they see a Snyder film.",
    "This  movie will never  win  an Oscar, but  it  still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in  all  good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys  who crash weddings  to  pick up woman have  zany adventures and  learn a little   something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances  perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who  may  be ready to move on with his  life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the  love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and  Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in,  well almost anything he  has  ever  made,  then you  have seen these characters before. But still, they  just work well together here. The   movie  contains just enough real emotion   to keep you caring and enough absurdity  and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't  Shakespeare,  but  it is funny. Highly recommend.",
    "\"Atonement\" is structurally comparable to a three-act play, with a  brief  epilogue. The three central characters are Briony, the younger daughter  of the wealthy Tallis family, her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, Cecilia's childhood  friend. Robbie is from a humble social background  (his mother  is one of the family's   servants), but academically brilliant,   and  Mr Tallis has paid  for him to be educated  through grammar school and Cambridge,  where he has obtained a First. A  brilliant future seemingly  awaits him, in whatever profession he  chooses, and he wants  to pursue a career  in  medicine. <br/><br/>Act I begins like an upper-class comedy  of manners. The  setting is the Tallis family's stately home, on a  hot summer's day in 1935. Briony, a  precocious thirteen-year-old  with ambitions to be a  writer, has written a play to be  performed by herself and her three  cousins,   but this project proves abortive due to  disagreements between them. Robbie  has fallen  in love with Cecilia and accidentally sends  her a sexually explicit  love-letter.  In other circumstances this might have  resulted  in disgrace, but as Cecilia returns his  passion   the  accident seems to  have been a happy one.  The  tone of the film changes abruptly, however, when Briony's cousin Lola is sexually  assaulted. Lola cannot  identify her assailant, but  Briony, who was a witness,  falsely accuses Robbie.  As a result, he  is convicted of attempted rape and sent to  prison.  <br/><br/>In Act  II, set in 1940,  Robbie, released  from jail, is now  a soldier with  the  British Army in France. He is desperately trying to reach  Dunkirk ahead of the  advancing  Germans, kept going  not by fighting spirit or patriotism, but by the hope of returning to Cecilia,  who has stood by him throughout his trial and imprisonment, becoming estranged from  her family as a result. In   Act  III  we see  Briony, now eighteen, as  a volunteer nurse in a  London hospital. It is in this Act that the theme of atonement comes to the fore. Briony is  starting to have doubts about her identification of Robbie as Lola's attacker,  so much so that she offers to withdraw her previous  testimony and help him  clear his   name. Her decision to work as a nurse rather than go to university and  to devote herself to  caring for the wounded  can also be seen as an attempt to atone for the part she played in blighting the life of an innocent man and  in   tearing  her family apart.<br/><br/>After \"The Last King of Scotland\" and \"Becoming Jane\", James McEvoy  is the  rising male star of the British cinema, and his performance here is the  best yet that I  have seen. Whereas  Dr Garrigan in \"The Last King\" was morally   flawed, and Lefroy in  \"Becoming Jane\" hid  his better  nature beneath a roguish exterior, Robbie is unambiguously heroic. McEvoy succeeds in  conveying his character's basic decency,  achieving  the difficult task of making him good without making him seem dull. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley is another rising British star, and  this is her second   film with director Joe Wright after \"Pride and  Prejudice\". Although  she was good in  the comedy \"Bend it  like Beckham\", I think that  her films with Wright are  her best, suggesting that her future  lies with serious drama rather than popcorn epics like \"Pirates of the   Caribbean\" in which she  seemed miscast. Her Cecilia was not only the loveliest, but also the liveliest and most  spirited  heroine of any film I  have seen recently. Special mentions must also go to Saoirse Ronan as  the young  Briony and to Vanessa  Redgrave who  plays the now-elderly  Briony in  the epilogue, set in 1999.  I felt,  however, that Romola Garai, at 25, was too old as the eighteen-year-old Briony. <br/><br/>This was only Wright's second feature film, and he has already established himself as an accomplished director. \"Pride and Prejudice\" is  a good  film, but \"Atonement\" is better. Ian McEwan's book is among the best novels of recent years,  and I doubt if any cinematic treatment could  capture  all its nuances. One  of its themes  in particular, the  debate  between literary traditionalism and  modernism, seems beyond the scope of any visual medium, and Wright and  the scriptwriter Christopher Hampton wisely steer clear of it. Hampton, who has turned the book into a very good screenplay, keeps  McEwan's final twist,  although it is here presented in a different way, with Briony revealing the truth in an TV interview. <br/><br/>If, however, the  film does not capture  all the literary nuances  of  the novel, Wright   makes up for this with  his extraordinary  visual imagination, something sometimes  lacking in films based upon  novels. \"Atonement\" joins that list of films (\"Far  from  Heaven\" and \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" are other examples that  come  to mind) where  almost  every scene  seems  composed like a painting.  This is true not only of Act I, set in that beautiful stately home (actually Stokesay Court in Shropshire), but also of  Act II, where Wright can  find  a   terrible beauty  even  in war, especially  in the scenes of the burning town and that long shot  of the Dunkirk  beaches  in  the grey morning light. Particularly moving  was the scene where the British soldiers sing  \"Dear  Lord and Father of Mankind\". The second line  of  John Greenleaf Whittier's hymn is, of course,  \"Forgive  Our  Foolish  Ways\"- a particularly apt comment  on war, and perhaps on the behaviour of some of the characters.<br/><br/>Also very good  was Dario Marianelli's  musical   score, which (appropriately for a film in  which writing plays  an important part) incorporated the sound of typewriter keys tapping.  Altogether an excellent film- I can only hope that  its British origins and  late summer  (traditionally blockbuster season) release date will not prejudice the  Academy against it when it  comes to  next   year's Oscars. 9/10",
    "A true  best of both worlds for classic Disney and classic Pixar fans. It had already been many years since   the acquisition,  but for me  this was the first time Disney's buyout felt like a positive direction for the animation pioneers. Filled with possibly Pixar's most attractive environments, character designs (Side note: Merida has my favorite character design  of any animated  human character.  I  mean seriously her hair alone is   a thing of beauty.), and easily its  best score,   the studio does a   deft send  up of classic princess  movies while  instilling the pure feeling  of magic they  are known for though Scotland's rich Celtic lore and  cryptic mysticism. Brave is a criminally underrated installment in the Pixar  cannon that I hope grows in stature over the years. If Wreck  It Ralph   is  Disney doing Pixar, Brave is Pixar  doing Disney.",
    "First of all, it is an Adam Sandler movie. If   you hate Adam Sandler movies, then you won't like this.<br/><br/>I gave it an  8/10 because it was one of the better  Adam Sandler movies. The   plot and storyline was better than I expected; the development was  pretty good as  well. There were definitely a lot  of  points where I  had to slap my forehead b/c  it  was   silly funny.<br/><br/>Yeah, its highly unrealistic, but  if you expected realism, whats wrong with  you? Sure, Jennifer Anniston is the \"uglier chick,\" which is like saying a  million dollars  isn't  that much money, but she did a good job in the movie.<br/><br/>The only complaint I  had was Adam Sandler used all the   lines I planned on using with the girl  I took to  see  it!",
    "Having read  the  first few Harry Potter   books before 2001 and  hearing   about the hype for the first movie, I  was excited. I heard there was going to  be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a  live version of one of the defining novels of our  generation. From what    I remember I went  with my  family and a family  friend  to  see the  movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed.  After the  movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some   familiar names (the  late Alan  Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others  not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had  their debut).  But it  was a good movie and was a party of colors  and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!",
    "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any   I've  ever seen and probably ever will.  A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through  such simplicity. Everything was top notch from  the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands  you to feel not only for the death  we witness, but  for the incredible life we discover. It prays   on the  obvious morality issues we all deal  with but also dangles the idea in front  of us that everyone goes through the same joys  and grievances, just not in the same  way. This is  a  momentous tale  that  deserves nothing  less than  the title of brilliance. <br/><br/>This visually and emotionally rich movie  recalls the life of a  very peculiar man  born in the early 20th century who ages  backwards. His tale unfolds through a  diary  read by the daughter  of his  love,  Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the  same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not  his life that makes him  unique. His love is  what   makes him special. He  spends a    lifetime trying   to  understand how his love for Daisy works  and still only gets a few  incredible years really  loving  her. As their  lives tell us,  the years of frustration  and hardship  are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. <br/><br/>The direction  in the  film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin  Button will garner David  Fincher the  recognition  he deserves. He  winds  this clock so  well and with such grace that the movie has  this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly  3  hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time,    it is  used wisely. <br/><br/>The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot   on and despite the heavy use of make-up  and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. <br/><br/>I left  the theater astonished that some one  could review this movie badly. It is an   extremely graceful  depiction of life, love, and the things we  lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly  not disappointed. This movie    is  probably not for everyone though. It's not your  average drama that spoon   feeds it's audience their emotions. It  is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What  makes  our lives  memorable are the moments we never  seem to grasp long enough before  letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button  is no less of  a wonder. ",
    "I have  enjoyed most of the computer-animated films made so far, ranging  from Pixar films  like \"Toy Story\" and \"The Incredibles\" to DreamWorks films  like \"Shrek.\" But  \"Finding Nemo\" is the one that remains unparalleled, not because  of its comedy or creativity, both of  which are equaled  in the \"Toy Story\"  movies and in \"Monsters Inc.,\" but because it  truly, more than any of the previous computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children's animated  film.<br/><br/>Humor in traditional animation is usually based on  broad slapstick and physical  exaggeration. There are occasional nods  to  this brand of humor in \"Finding   Nemo,\"  as when a flock of seagulls ram into  a boat and we see their  beaks crowing on the  other side of the  sail.  But such sequences  only  call attention to how far this movie generally departs from old cartoon conventions. Instead,  the movie invests its world of sentient animals with a surprisingly scientific  texture. All  of the   animals are based on  real species. The fish  tank  is constructed out of real devices. There  is a  strong sense of locale, as Marlin (Albert Brooks) travels across the  Pacific to Australia, where  even the animals speak with an Australian accent. In    a scene  that I'm  sure Gary  Larson of  \"Far  Side\" fame  loved, a pelican discusses with a  group of fish the intricate  details of dentistry. The  fact that the  animals talk and understand what's going on  is treated as though it were a natural  feature of the world.  The realism is so striking  that by the end of the film, you'll almost believe  it possible for fish  to  plot an escape from  a tank.<br/><br/>Far from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of  the  humor is based on parodies of  human behavior: repentant  sharks start  a  club  that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, a  school of  fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves  into spectacular patterns, and a  four-year-old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive.  The manner  in which Marlin finds  his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film  for the number of coincidences involved.<br/><br/>The story employs the same basic formula used in \"Toy  Story,\" in  which two characters, one  uptight   and the other clueless, are   thrown together  as they're forced to  journey through a world populated by creatures  that are a lot  more knowing than the humans realize.  This  movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real  human  disorder is risky, to say the least, and I'm glad the filmmakers didn't lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only  generates some of  the film's biggest laughs,  but reinforces  the character  interaction that is so  central  to  the story. This is in  fact the only  Pixar   film to feature   true  character development. In  the course  of his voyage, Marlin learns  to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced  by the  film's director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns  to be self-reliant.<br/><br/>Of course, none of the sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and  humans that  Marlin encounters along the  way really mean any harm. They're just doing what they do. As Nigel the Pelican tells Nemo at one point, \"Fish gotta swim, birds  gotta  eat.\" That's perhaps the film's most  interesting insight, that there are no true villains, just creatures that  act according to their nature,  and a few that transcend it.

    "What an incredibly brave and honest look  at relationships.  I've have never seen a  film   so precisely and  brilliantly  capture  this kind  of emotion and transfer it to the screen  the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither  Ethan Hawke or Julie  Delpy was  nominated  for any major  acting awards, actually screw that!  What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any  recognition for the screenwriting   or brilliant directing of his  wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after  it all they go back and show every location   that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming  through the  body language, facial expressions, and  the  dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top  ten late night  conversations  we've all   had with close friends whether  it was serious or in jest.  And respect to   Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of  a couple minor swear words? Could of easily  been removed without really  desecrating the  film but he keeps  it in anyways. Screw you hollywood,  your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s,  your 'take  the glasses off the girl  and now she's  pretty' movies.  This is real romance! This is  what I come to the movies for, to think, to be  provoked and to  be swept away by the magic that only cinema  can provide. Before  Sunrise has single-handedly reminded  me about why  I  goto the movies......",
    "I  went  to a small advance screening of this movie on  July 19th, knowing no more than the names of a few of the  actors and  that it was a fantasy/adventure quest of some sort.<br/><br/>The    plot line really is nothing like I have seen, and  a unique story is certainly appreciated with  everything else that is currently in or coming soon   to theaters.  In spite of what first  impressions may give, it  isn't   cheesy, corny, tacky, or ridiculous,  and is actually highly entertaining and funny.  The flow is quite well done, nothing  seems rushed or  dragged out. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical  and adds  much to the film, as opposed to simply filling the silence as  often happens in movies or TV. And even though I might have known what was coming at points, I still couldn't bear  to  stop watching the screen; to  my knowledge, not  a single person left the theater  during  the entire movie.<br/><br/>My one gripe is  that there seems to   be almost no marketing for this  film, and as  brilliant as it is I can't  figure  out why.",
    "The advertisements for this movie do  it  serious injustice. I was standing in the lobby of a movie  theater at a  free showing, and almost didn't walk in,  because the trailers and ads had me  convinced it was a complete  waste of time. The advertisements portray the film  as being merely  a vehicle for   shirtless boys to beat on each other and  hot girls to wear bikinis. While  there is no   shortage  of either, the movie has a  strong  underlying theme and a decent plot.<br/><br/>At the thematic level, the movie is about accepting responsibility for your actions, controlling your emotions, and making good choices.  It's  as  much about motivations as macho.<br/><br/>Yes,  it is a teen-targeted movie. You've got rich kids  running  around in massive   mansions driving expensive  cars, but that's just the setting.  You've got  people beating  the crap out of each  other, but that's just a plot device. The heart of the movie is  about personal growth and making choices. It's not an empty action  flick or a taped brawl.<br/><br/>It's not the  best film of the year, and it  may well wind  up as a late night cable movie  in a few  months, but it's nowhere  near as bad  as people expect. It's definitely  worth the price of a rental,   and worth the  $10 to see  it  in theaters, if you've got no other plans.

    "The Battle  of Jutland (, the Battle  of Skagerrak) was a  naval battle  fought between Britain's Royal Navy Grand Fleet, under Admiral Sir John Jellicoe,  and the Imperial German Navy's  High Seas Fleet, under Vice-Admiral   Reinhard Scheer, during the First World War. The battle unfolded in extensive manoeuvring and three main engagements (the  battlecruiser action, the fleet  action and the night action), from 31 May to 1  June 1916, off the North Sea coast   of  Denmark's Jutland Peninsula. It  was the largest  naval battle and the only full-scale clash of battleships  in that  war.  Jutland was the third fleet action between steel battleships, following the Battle of the  Yellow   Sea  in  1904   and the decisive Battle of Tsushima in  1905,  during the Russo-Japanese  War.   Jutland was the  last major battle in world history fought primarily by  battleships. In  terms of total ships displaced, it  was  the largest surface naval battle in history. Germany's High Seas Fleet intended to lure out, trap, and destroy a   portion of the Grand Fleet, as the German naval force was insufficient  to  openly engage the entire  British  fleet. This formed part of  a larger strategy to break the British blockade of Germany and to  allow German  naval vessels access to the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Great Britain's  Royal Navy   pursued a  strategy of engaging and destroying the High Seas Fleet, thereby keeping German naval forces contained and away from Britain and her shipping lanes.",

    "Maritime archaeology (also known as marine archaeology)  is a discipline within archaeology as   a whole  that specifically studies  human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers through the study of  associated physical remains, be they vessels, shore-side facilities,  port-related structures, cargoes,  human remains and  submerged landscapes.  A specialty within maritime archaeology is  nautical archaeology, which studies ship  construction and  use. As with archaeology as a whole, maritime  archaeology can be practised within the historical, industrial, or  prehistoric periods. An associated discipline, and again one that lies within archaeology itself, is underwater archaeology, which studies the past  through any submerged remains be they  of  maritime interest  or not. An  example from the prehistoric era would be  the remains of submerged  settlements or deposits now lying under water despite  having been dry land  when  sea levels  were lower. The study  of submerged aircraft lost in lakes,  rivers or  in the sea is an example from the historical,  industrial or modern  era. Another example  are the remains of discovered and potential medieval  bridges connecting the islands on  the  lake with the mainland. Many specialist sub-disciplines   within the  broader maritime and    underwater archaeological categories have  emerged in recent years.",

    "In computer science, formal specifications  are mathematically based  techniques whose  purpose are to help with the  implementation of  systems and software. They are used to describe a system, to  analyze its behavior, and to aid in its design  by  verifying key properties of  interest through rigorous and effective reasoning tools. These specifications are formal  in the sense that  they have a syntax,  their semantics fall within one domain,  and they are able to be used to infer useful information.  Motivation\nIn each passing decade, computer  systems have become increasingly more powerful and, as a result, they have become more impactful to society. Because of this, better  techniques are needed  to assist in the design  and  implementation  of reliable software. Established   engineering disciplines use mathematical analysis as the foundation of  creating and validating  product   design. Formal specifications are one such way  to  achieve this in software  engineering reliability as once predicted. Other methods such as  testing  are more commonly used to enhance  code  quality.",

    "Cadmus of  Miletus  (, Kádmos  ho Milésios) was according to some ancient authorities, the oldest of the logographi. Scholars who accept this  view, assign him to   about 550 BC; others regard him as   purely mythical. A confused notice in the  Suda mentions three persons of the name: the  first, the inventor of the alphabet; the second, the son of Pandion, according to  some the first  prose  writer, a little later than Orpheus, author of a history of the  foundation of Miletus and  of  Ionia generally, in four books; the third, the son of  Archelaus,  of later  date,  author of a history of Attica   in fourteen books, and of some poems of  an erotic character. As Dionysius of Halicarnassus (Judicium de Thucydide, c. 23) distinctly  states that  the work current in his time  under the name of  Cadmus was a forgery,  it is most probable that the two first are  identical with the Phoenician  Cadmus, who,  as the reputed inventor  of  letters, was subsequently transformed into the Milesian and the author of an historical work. In this connection it should be  observed  that the old Milesian nobles traced  their  descent  back to the Phoenician or one of his companions. ",

    "Floyd Alburn Firestone (1898–1986) was an acoustical physicist, who in 1940 while a  professor at the University of Michigan invented the  first practical ultrasonic testing method and apparatus. He  was  granted US Patent 2,280,226 for the invention  in 1942.  Manufactured  by  Sperry Corporation, the testing device was known variously  as the Firestone-Sperry Reflectoscope, the Sperry   Ultrasonic  Reflectoscope, the Sperry Reflectoscope and sometimes also  just as a  Supersonic Reflectoscope, the name  Firestone  had  originally coined for the instrument. The technology is not just used  in quality control in  factories to reject defective parts before shipment, but also revolutionized transportation safety. For example, ultrasonic testing is used for safety maintenance inspection of railroad cars,  particularly axles  and wheels, aircraft,  particularly fuselages, and  other  transportation  vessels  for material fatigue. Dr. Firestone’s ultrasonic pulse  echo technique  for metal defect  testing was also later applied in medical  diagnosis, giving birth to the  field of Echocardiography and to the  field of Medical Ultrasonography, generally. Dr. Firestone  was the editor  of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America  from 1939-1957. Among  Firestone’s many  other inventions in  his field are in a single year   an “automatic device for the minute inspection of  flaws”, “a new  and  useful  improvement in hook-up of  electrical apparatus”, and “[a] device for measuring noise”, and,  even, later a “musical typewriter”. In 1933, Firestone proposed an  alternative to the mechanical–electrical analogy of James Clerk  Maxwell  in which force is made the analogy of  voltage (the impedance analogy).  Firestone's analogy (now called the  mobility analogy) makes force the  analogy of current.   In  this work he introduced the concept of \"through\" and \"across\"  variables and demonstrated  that there were analogies for these variables in other energy domains,  making  it possible to  treat a complex system as a unified whole in analysis.   Firestone's analogy became popular amongst mechanical  filter  designers  because it has the property of preserving network topologies  when transforming between the mechanical and electrical domains.",

    "The whinchat (Saxicola rubetra) is  a small migratory passerine  bird  breeding in Europe  and western Asia and wintering in central Africa.  At one time considered to be in the  thrush family, Turdidae, it is now placed in  the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae. Both sexes have  a strong supercilium, brownish upper  parts mottled darker, a pale throat and breast, a pale buff to whitish  belly, and a  blackish tail with white bases to the outer tail  feathers, but in the breeding  season, the male has an orange-buff throat  and  breast.  The  whinchat is a  solitary  species, favouring open grassy country  with rough vegetation and   scattered small  shrubs. It perches in  elevated locations ready to pounce on the insects  and other small invertebrates  that form  its diet.  The nest is   built by the female on the ground in coarse vegetation, with a  clutch of four to seven eggs being laid. The hen incubates the eggs for about thirteen days and then both parents feed  the nestlings. Fledging takes place  about eighteen days after hatching and the parents continue  to  feed the young for  another  fortnight. Moulting takes place in late summer before  the migration southwards, and again on the wintering grounds in Africa before  the migration northwards in  spring. The whinchat is a common  species with a wide range and  the International Union  for  Conservation of Nature has classified  it  as being of \"least concern\".",
    "María  Dolores \"Lola\" Flores Ruiz (21 January 1923 –  16 May 1995) was a  Spanish  singer, actress, bailaora and businesswoman. Born in Jerez  de la Frontera, Flores became interested in the performing arts at  a very young age.  Known for her overwhelming personality onstage, she first debuted as  a dancer at age sixteen at the stage production  Luces de España, in her hometown. After being discovered by  film  director Fernando Mignoni, Flores  moved to  Madrid to  pursue a professional career in music and film, with her first gig being the lead role  in Mignoni's  Martingala (1940). Flores succeeded as a  film  and stage actress.  In 1943 she obtained her breakthrough role in the musical stage production Zambra alongside Manolo  Caracol,  in which she sung  original compositions by Rafael de  León, Manuel López-Quiroga  Miquel and Antonio Quintero,  including \"La Zarzamora\" and \"La Niña de  Fuego\", mostly singing flamenco  music, copla,  rumba and ranchera. She then started to  receive widespread media coverage. In 1951, Flores signed a five-film  contract  with  Suevia Films for a value of 6 million pesetas, which became   the best paid contract for a performing artist   in  Spanish  history. Under that  contract  she starred in major productions like La Niña de la Venta (1951), ¡Ay,  Pena, Penita, Pena! (1953), La Danza de los Deseos (1954) and El  Balcón de la Luna (1962),  among many  others, which  spawned  the signature songs \"A Tu Vera\"   and \"¡Ay, Pena, Penita,  Pena!\". Since then, she was popularly dubbed as La Faraona. During  her life,  Flores performed in   more than 35  films,  pigeonholed, in many of them, in Andalusian folklore.  As a  bailaora, Flores enraged several generations of continents, although she distanced herself from flamenco canons. She also recorded over twenty albums,   which she toured though Europe, Latin America and the United States.",
    "Contemporary architecture is the  architecture of the 21st  century.   No single style is  dominant.  Contemporary   architects work in several different styles, from postmodernism,  high-tech architecture and new  interpretations of traditional architecture to highly conceptual  forms  and designs, resembling sculpture  on an enormous scale. Some of these  styles and approaches make use of very advanced technology and modern building materials, such as tube structures which allow  construction  of buildings that  are taller, lighter and stronger than those in the 20th  century, while  others prioritize the use of natural and ecological materials like stone, wood and  lime. One   technology that is  common to all forms of contemporary architecture is the  use of  new techniques of computer-aided design, which  allow  buildings to be designed and  modeled on computers in three dimensions, and constructed with more precision and speed. Contemporary buildings and styles vary greatly.  Some   feature concrete structures wrapped  in glass or aluminium screens, very  asymmetric facades, and cantilevered  sections which hang  over the street. Skyscrapers twist, or break into crystal-like facets. Facades are designed to shimmer or  change color at different times  of day. ",

    "Food First, also known as the  Institute for Food and Development Policy, is a nonprofit organization based in Oakland, California, USA. Founded in 1975 by Frances Moore Lappé  and Joseph Collins, it  describes  itself as  a \"people's  think tank and education-for-action center\". Its mission is “to eliminate the  injustices  that cause hunger”. According to the Food First website, its main goal is to forge  food sovereignty for human rights  and   sustainable livelihoods, and to do so it has three programs of  development: building local agri-foods systems, farmers forming food sovereignty, and democratizing development. The organization is meant  to offer  policy analysis  on poverty, agriculture, and development,   and is  highly critical of the policies implemented by the  World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The organization focuses on the Green Revolution which was supported in  the  1970s and  which  did not produce the development people hoped for.   Instead  it  put  in place a  system that has high input-costs, but does not produce a   yield  much higher than traditional farming methods. There has been  a recent resurgence of Green Revolution ideas, especially with the large-scale support of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and  high-yield-variety agriculture. Food  First claims that these policies  will only further global  inequalities, and has produced several policy briefs stating that the  way to establish  fair and  effective   development is through local sustainable agriculture.

She   currently lives  in Philadelphia.  She  is  currently doing   research on street musicians in  Condesa in Mexico City. Her research mainly focuses on performance  practices, global and  local  contexts,  and the political uses to which  they  are directed. Levi has performed ethnographic field work on lucha libre in Mexico City and the significance it  has in  the Mexican culture.  Not only did she  do ethnographic field work,   but she also trained with a retired lucha libre wrestler and his students. Levi worked with this well respected wrestler for  a year and a half and incorporated this as research into her book The World of Lucha   Libre  This allowed  Levi to view lucha libre as an arena that examined the connections between  ideas of mestizaje, class, gender, aesthetic values, mass mediation, and the state.  This thus led her  to write her  book  The World  of Lucha Libra in which these ideas are  explored. In  a Los Angeles Times interview in 2009  she described lucha libre  created a unique, cross-class \"cultural phenomenon\" that put  on a  \"display of these larger-than-life  heroes but  heroes that everybody...knew  [and] came from their social class.\"",
    "The Kaya identity is an identity stating that   the total emission level of the greenhouse  gas  carbon dioxide can be expressed as the product of four factors:   human population,   GDP per capita, energy intensity (per unit  of GDP), and carbon intensity (emissions per  unit of energy consumed).  It is  a  concrete form of the more  general I = PAT equation relating factors that determine the level of human  impact on  climate. Although the terms  in the  Kaya identity  would in theory cancel out, it is useful in practice to calculate emissions in terms of more readily available data, namely population, GDP per capita, energy per unit GDP, and emissions per unit energy. It  furthermore highlights the  elements  of the global economy  on which one could act to reduce emissions, notably  the energy intensity  per unit  GDP and the emissions per unit energy.

    " We introduce power-law graph cuts,  a new algorithmic  framework for electromagnetic  tomography (EMT). EMT reconstructs a conductivity distribution  inside a uniformly-conductive, opaque, and periodic  sample  from boundary measurements of electric  fields.  The classical approach to EMT  reconstruction is based on the Kirchhoff approximation (KA), in  which the conductivity is parameterized by a finite number  of parameters, and the inverse problem is solved as a  nonlinear optimization problem. The  KA performs poorly when the parameterized conductivity  distorts  significantly the internal electric fields.  We show that power-law graph cuts,   a novel convex optimization approach,  are capable of recovering the true  conductivity distribution accurately  even in the presence of significant distortion.",

    "Abstract:\n\nLeft  atrial  segmentation from 3D gadolinium  enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  is a  crucial  step in diagnosing and managing cardiac arrhythmias. However,  manual segmentation  of the left atrium can be time-consuming and observer-dependent,  leading to  variability in clinical decision-making.

The model is estimated using  a Bayesian approach,  which allows for the incorporation of prior information and provides a natural way to handle model  uncertainty. The paper also  discusses the use of informative prior  distributions and provides guidance on how to choose appropriate priors.  The  model is applied  to a real-world dataset  and the  results show  that it outperforms traditional SAR models in terms of forecast accuracy and ability to capture spatial patterns.  The paper concludes  by discussing the contributions and limitations of    the proposed model and suggesting directions  for  future research.\n\nKeywords:  spatial data, dynamic spatial   autoregressive models, heteroskedastic disturbances, Bayesian estimation, informative priors.",
    "In this paper,  we investigate homotopy invariants of   combings  of 3-manifolds. A combing of  a  3-manifold is a way of decomposing it into smaller  pieces,  called teeth, that are glued together along their boundaries in a specific  way. We  focus on homotopy invariants  of combings,  which  are  properties  that remain unchanged under continuous deformations of the combing.\n\nWe first establish  a framework for   studying  homotopy  invariants of combings by defining a notion of homotopy between combings and introducing a category whose objects  are combings and whose morphisms are homotopy classes  of combings. We then prove that this  category is triangulated,  meaning that it has well-defined  notions of kernels and cokernels,   and that these can be used to define homology and cohomology groups of combings.\n\nNext, we explore various homotopy invariants of  combings, including the number of teeth, the total space  of the combing,  and the fundamental group of the  complement of the teeth. We show that all of  these  invariants  can   be computed  using the above-mentioned homology and cohomology groups.\n\nIn particular, we prove that the number of teeth is equal to the dimension of the kernel of  a certain map from the homology group  of  the 3-manifold to its  cohomology group, while  the total space of the combing can be identified with the cokernel of another map between these groups. Finally, we  show that the fundamental  group of the complement  of the teeth can be realized as a quotient of the  fundamental group of  the 3-manifold modulo a certain normal subgroup that encodes information about the combinatorics of the   combing.\n\nOur results provide   a new perspective on the study of 3-manifolds and their decompositions, and they have  important implications for  the understanding of topological   and  geometric structure of  these  spaces. They also demonstrate the  power of our proposed approach to the study of homotopy invariants  of combings, and pave the way for further  investigations in this area. ",
    "> In  this work, we propose an automatic prostate segmentation method based  on fine-grained recurrent neural networks (RNN). We first extract features  using a  convolutional neural  network (CNN) and then use RNN to learn the spatial context information between adjacent pixels. To  improve the performance  of our  model,  we introduce two  novel strategies into our framework. Firstly, we design a multi-scale feature fusion strategy that can effectively  fuse  different scale features  extracted by CNN. Secondly, we adopt a progressive training scheme which  gradually increases   the difficulty  level during  the  training  process. Experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance  compared with other methods.",

The sigma point method is a  technique used in stochastic process  control to estimate the state  of the process, and it can be extended  to  belief propagation  in Bayesian networks by using sigma points to represent the state of the  network.\n\nThe proposed approach uses sigma points to initialize the belief distribution  and  then iteratively updates the belief distribution  using Bayesian  rule and the sigma point method. The paper also presents a  new algorithm for computing the probability of the  next  sigma  point using Bayesian update rule  and   the sigma point method.\n\nThe proposed approach is shown to be  effective in  estimating the  posterior  probability of  the network parameters in a Bayesian  model,  as  well as in  computing the  likelihood of the network parameters given new data.

    "The  purpose of this research paper is to propose a method for improving state-of-the-art  image segmentation methods  for biomedical images. They  do this by improving upon Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in order  to improve  results with regards to accuracy and speed.    We have previously shown that state-of-the-art  semantic segmentation  results outperform  other methods for brain tumor segmentation and are competitive with expert annotator measurements.  However, these networks are not fully convolutional in nature,  meaning they may not be  well-suited for fast applications. One of  the most significant   advantages  of  the fully convolutional network is that it is very fast and computationally  efficient  in that it does not need to have a pool   layer and  fully  connected layers. Another reason is that fully convolutional networks are trainable end-to-end and  they  provide full  segmentation mask output with  one pass per image at run-time, which  is advantageous if time in one of the critical resources for biomedical image analysis. The  paper shows through various experiments that  full networks with quantized  weights and activations  are significantly better than  a network with  floating-point (32-bit) weights and activations. For example, quantizing weights and activations reduce  memory  requirements  by 4x, memory requirements by 8x, and runtime by 3-30x, depending on input size and   computational complexity  of each image. The paper  also includes a  discussion of the performance impact of different weight  and activation bit-depth trade-offs.

Ann remarks that he does not introduce himself when he asks for their identification.  The policeman then  asks Thomas to get  out of the  car, which  he  does. Ann asks   the policeman  what he is doing, and  he  replies that he is just asking questions. Ann tells him that she wishes that  he would tell them what he is doing, and he replies that he has  asked Thomas  to get out  of the car  because a stolen car has been reported in the area. The policeman then asks Thomas to state his name, and Thomas replies that his name is  Ronald Mellace. The  policeman then  asks Thomas to state his address, and Thomas replies that he  lives at 333 Ash, in Laramie.

    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Order  In August   1921, the United Kingdom and United States declared war on Germany  and Italy during World  War I,   but both Britain   and the U.S.  were unprepared to wage war.  The British and  French, in particular, were unaware of the growing power  of Marxist  and anarchist groups in Germany, and feared that this  power would  prove a threat to their ability to control the  war. They therefore drafted plans to eliminate those groups. The Black Order,  a German anarchist group, was  suspected of being a threat through many methods, such as attempting to  assassinate German members of the government and military and sabotage government installations. In November 1920, an unknown person shot and killed  Baron Hermann von  Kettler-Löwenstam, a leading figure  in the British government  and the military. Soon afterwards,  the British and French started  executing members of the Black Order. In May  1921,   Black Order member Gertrud Rindt  was executed at London's Gaiety Prison after being convicted of conspiring to  assassinate a British official. Black Order members suspected of being responsible for military action were shot by firing squads  and some had  their teeth   crushed in the process. Members of the Black Order were also sent to prison  on trumped-up charges, their lives destroyed. Many  Black   Order members were also detained after the assassination  attempts.  In a series of  raids carried out by the secret police, Black Order members were captured and executed  on the outskirts  of London,  the capital city of Great Britain.\n\n\nSo here we   come to the  point of this post where  the story  gets a bit more complicated. On August  18th 1921, the United States formally declared war on  Germany. However, in  the same week, the Black Order issued a call  for  revolution, which according to the book,  \"Red Hand,  Black Hand\" by Frank M. Johnson, \"made it clear that they had a plan to overthrow the regime and change course   to socialism.\" This is a  major   difference from the  previous \"plot\" in a  way, as it was the \"plot\" of the Black Order not  the United  States  that   declared war with Germany. The United States did  not  believe in socialism and would not  act on  any information that would suggest that it did. The  only information that the United States knew about the Black Order came from  Germany and Russia,   and they were the ones that they most feared. In retrospect, I  ",
    "Crusader is  a fantasy novels  that  consists of five parts that follow a  young boy  going  on a journey with his  father, a knight, to a  far off land. The story is written by Jody LeFauve, who currently works as a freelance writer for The Hollywood  Reporter. The story was written for the 2015 Hugo Awards,  along  with the three first book of the  Inheritance Cycle. The plot synopsis  reads:  \"The tale  centers  on a young boy  named  John, who is taken under the wing of an enigmatic, yet wise, woman called  Matron,  who is  part of a society called the  Crusaders. There, John  and Matron are reunited, and the boy finds true love in  Matron's household. On Matron's advice, John returns to King David's court. Now,  the boy must choose whether to be true to his heritage and seek out his birthright  or be  a  faithful servant, fulfilling the destiny his mother foretold.\"\n\nI   believe the book itself to   be very interesting, it is  set in Middle Ages, has epic fantasy, magic, knights,   dragons, elves,  and all  other things that go along with that. It seems to take the form of  a western, with a bit of fantasy thrown into the  mix, with John traveling to  a different land where  he meets his  destiny. It follows  his   journey from his birth, as his life slowly changes, to the discovery of his  family.\n\nMy first thought was that maybe this is from someone else, but I was absolutely sure this comes from an author I  know personally. When  I found out it was from Ms. LeFauve, I  had no  doubts.  I started reading  the book, and   all the indications  were  that it was hers, and a beautiful piece of  writing. Not only about the prose, which I will  discuss later in this review, but more so about  her vision  of   John, his quest,  and some  of the characters. I do not want to give too much away, as I  still do not have my copy yet. I am not sure why I am sharing my opinion on this, but  I am  very  confident in my choice.  It also gives me an excuse to talk  about  another thing. Ahem. Okay  then you got me. Okay  so the book   does not feature  a male protagonist either, but still has a female lead.

They argue that  politicians should be  focused solely on serving the public and not  on personal financial  gain.\n\nHowever, supporters of politicians earning additional income argue that it allows them to bring valuable expertise and experience to their roles.  They argue that  politicians should be able to use their skills and knowledge to contribute to society in a variety of  ways, including   through paid work.\n\nThe  debate over politicians' earnings is likely   to continue, with calls for  greater  transparency  and  stricter rules on outside  income.  As public scrutiny of politicians' finances increases, it remains  to be seen how this will impact the future earnings of high-profile figures like William Hague.",
    "Italian drinks company Illva Saronno is reportedly in talks to acquire a stake  in a Chinese winery, as it seeks to tap into  the growing demand for    wine in   China. The move comes as   China's middle class continues to expand and develop a taste  for  Western products, including wine.\n\nIllva Saronno, known for its   popular liqueur brand Disaronno, is said to be in discussions with China's Changyu  Pioneer Wine Company. Changyu is one of China's oldest and largest  winemakers, with a history dating back to  1892. The company has been  actively  expanding its operations in recent  years, acquiring vineyards in France, Spain, and Australia.\n\nChina has become one of  the world's largest consumers of  wine, with a market that is expected to continue growing. The country's middle class, which is  estimated to be around 400  million people, has  shown a  growing interest in wine,  particularly imported  varieties. This  has presented an opportunity for foreign  wine producers to enter the Chinese market and establish  a presence.\n\nIllva Saronno's potential investment  in Changyu would  allow the Italian  company to gain  a foothold  in the   Chinese wine market and benefit from  the growing demand. It  would also provide Changyu with access to Illva Saronno's distribution network and  expertise  in the global drinks industry.\n\nThe move comes as other international wine producers  have also sought  to  capitalize on China's growing  wine market. French wine giant,  Moët   Hennessy,  recently announced plans to open a  vineyard in China's Ningxia region, known for its favorable grape-growing  conditions.  Australian wine producer, Treasury  Wine Estates, has also been expanding its  presence in China, with a  focus on premium wine brands.\n\nHowever, entering the  Chinese market is  not  without its   challenges. The country's  wine industry is still  relatively young and faces  competition from both domestic and  international producers.  Additionally, there are cultural differences in taste preferences and drinking  habits that companies  must navigate.\n\nDespite these  challenges, the potential partnership between Illva Saronno and Changyu represents an opportunity for both companies to capitalize on the  growing demand for wine  in China. As the Chinese middle class  continues to expand and develop a taste for Western products,  the wine industry is poised for further growth in the country.",
    "Hollywood film  star Megan Fox has revealed she is  the anonymous benefactor behind a  bid to  save a historic theatre  in Los Angeles. The former Transformers actress  has pledged a substantial  amount of money to  support the  restoration efforts  of the Grauman's Chinese Theatre.\n\nIn  a heartfelt statement, Fox  expressed her love for the city's rich film history and her desire to preserve cultural landmarks for  future generations.  The iconic theatre, which first opened its doors in 1927, has hosted  countless movie premieres and  is known  for its  grand architecture and  famous hand and footprints in the cement  courtyard.\n\nThe bid to save the theatre comes as a  relief to many residents and film enthusiasts  who  were  concerned about the  future of the iconic  cinema.  Grauman's Chinese Theatre has  faced various challenges in recent years,  including financial difficulties and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced the closure of  many entertainment venues.\n\nFox's involvement   in the restoration  project has brought renewed hope  to the  community and the wider film industry.  Her  generous  contribution will not only aid the preservation of the  historical  building  but also  allow for   the  implementation of modern upgrades and improvements to enhance the overall cinematic experience.\n\nThe news of Megan Fox's philanthropic  endeavor  has received widespread praise  and recognition. Many have lauded the actress for using  her  platform and resources  to support and sustain a cultural landmark that holds immense significance   in the history  of cinema. As a  testament  to her commitment  to the preservation of arts and culture, Fox is  now being hailed  as both a Hollywood star and a  cultural guardian.\n\nWith ongoing discussions and plans underway, it remains to be seen how the restoration project   will unfold. However, the involvement of a high-profile figure like Megan Fox is likely to attract further attention and support from other individuals and organizations passionate about preserving cultural heritage.\n\nThe news serves  as a reminder of the vital role that celebrities can play in championing causes close to their hearts. In this case, Megan Fox's  love for film and her devotion  to Los Angeles' cinematic  legacy have prompted her to step up and  make a significant contribution  that will have  a  lasting impact on the local  community and the wider  film  industry.\n\nAs the  restoration project  progresses and the iconic Grauman's Chinese Theatre is revived, Megan Fox's involvement will undoubtedly be remembered as a turning  point  in  the theatre's history. Her support not only secures the survival of a beloved landmark but  also reaffirms the importance of   preserving  our  cultural heritage  for future generations to  appreciate and enjoy.",
    "Ballet companies around the world are facing an uncertain future as the COVID-19  pandemic continues to wreak havoc  on the performing arts  industry. With  theaters closed and performances  canceled, dancers and  choreographers are left  in limbo, unsure of  when  they  will be able to return to the stage.\n\nThe financial impact  of   the  pandemic has hit ballet companies hard.  Many rely heavily on  ticket sales and donations  to fund  their operations, and with  no performances taking place, their   revenue  streams have dried up. This has  led to layoffs and furloughs, leaving  dancers and staff members struggling to make ends meet.\n\nIn  addition to the financial challenges,  the pandemic has also disrupted the training and development of ballet dancers.  With  studios closed  and in-person classes canceled, dancers  have had  to find alternative ways to stay in shape and maintain their technique. Some have turned to online classes and virtual rehearsals, but it is not the same as being in  a studio  with fellow  dancers and instructors.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of  performance  opportunities has left dancers feeling disconnected and unfulfilled. Ballet  is a highly collaborative art form, and the absence of live  performances has deprived dancers of the opportunity to  share  their art with audiences and receive the immediate feedback  and validation   that comes with performing.\n\nThere are also concerns about the long-term impact  of  the pandemic on the ballet industry. With theaters  closed and audiences  hesitant to return to crowded  venues, it is unclear when  ballet companies  will be able to resume regular performances. This uncertainty has led to  fears that some companies may  not survive the financial strain and may be forced  to  close their doors  permanently.\n\nDespite  these challenges, the ballet community remains resilient and  determined to find ways to adapt and  survive. Many  companies have been exploring innovative ways  to engage with  audiences, such as live-streamed performances and outdoor shows. Dancers have also been using this time  to explore new creative projects  and collaborations, finding inspiration in the  midst of  adversity.\n\nHowever, the road to recovery for the ballet industry will not  be easy. It will  require   continued support from governments, philanthropists, and  audiences to ensure that ballet  companies  can weather this storm  and continue to bring  the beauty   and artistry of ballet  to the world. Only time will tell what the future holds for  ballet, but one thing is certain: the passion and dedication of the ballet community will  not waver, even in the face of uncertainty. ",
    "American car manufacturer Ford has reported higher-than-expected profits for the first quarter of  this year, thanks   to strong performance from its financial services  division rather than its car sales. The  firm's  net income  reached $3.3bn  (£2.4bn), almost double the amount seen in the same period last year.\n\nFord Credit, the company's financial arm, accounted for a substantial portion of the overall profit. The division reported earnings of $1.1bn (£800m), a  remarkable increase  of  60% compared to the  previous year. This surge in profits is mostly attributed to higher  pricing  for used  vehicles, which resulted  in  higher residual values and therefore  better lease  residuals.\n\nIn contrast,  the car  manufacturing side  of Ford faced some challenges.  The firm's  global vehicle sales fell by 8% during the first quarter compared  to the  same period  in  2020, largely due to  the ongoing impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic and global  chip shortages disrupting production. However, despite the decline in sales volume, the company managed to offset the losses through higher margins on the vehicles  it did sell.\n\nWhile Ford's finance division has historically been an important profit contributor, the outperformance of  Ford  Credit  is particularly noteworthy this  quarter. The  finance sector has been a reliable source for  car manufacturers, offsetting any downturns in vehicle sales. Furthermore,  the division's strong performance is indicative  of solid  demand for  cars, as it reflects increased leasing activity. This suggests  that the automotive industry is showing signs of a   steady recovery, reinforcing the overall positive outlook for the sector.\n\nHowever, challenges remain ahead  for Ford and other car manufacturers.  The ongoing global chip shortage  continues  to hinder production   and is expected  to result in continued  disruptions  in  the coming months. Additionally, the  rapidly expanding electric vehicle market presents both  opportunities and challenges  for traditional automakers like  Ford, as they race to catch up with competitors.\n\nIn response, Ford has made significant investments in electric and autonomous vehicle  technologies, aiming to release  a range of new electric  models in  the coming  years. The company is also addressing the chip shortage by working closely with suppliers and exploring alternative solutions to alleviate   the  impact.\n\nDespite the obstacles, Ford's strong financial performance in the  first  quarter reassures investors, demonstrating the resilience and  adaptability of the  company amid a rapidly changing automotive   landscape. With the finance division playing a pivotal role in  bolstering profits, Ford is well-positioned to navigate  future  challenges and  capitalize on  emerging  opportunities in the market.",

    " Ford has  posted a  record quarterly  profit  of $3.6bn, as strong finance arm performances   offset falling car sales.\n\nThe carmaker  said it had  benefited from higher prices  and sales of new vehicles in  the  US.\n\nHowever, sales  were hit by a lack of semiconductor  computer chips, which are  now only available at premium prices.\n\nThe global  shortage of chips has forced   several carmakers to  cut production, pushing up prices of both new and used  cars.\n\nFord   chief executive  Jim Farley  said the company  was \" outperform\" and focused on executing its plans. The strong financial performance \"demonstrates once  again the importance of our customer-focused operational execution and discipline,\"  he said.\n\nFord said  it was now expecting its full-year pre-tax profits to be around  $11.5bn  to $12.5bn, up from  $9bn to $10bn previously.\n\nThe company  also said it was generating stronger  profit margins in every region,   including China.\n\nIt  reported a  9% increase in revenue to  $40.8bn for the three months to 30 September, compared with the same period in 2020.\n\nFord's  profit margin - a measure of how much profit it  makes on each vehicle - rose to 13.1%, up from 10.2% a year earlier.\n\nThe company said  it had benefited from higher prices for its vehicles sold in  North  America and Europe, as well  as increased sales in its credit division.

    "A new  type of brain-computer interface  (BCI)  has been developed  by scientists in the US, which uses  electrical pulses to control  computers and other devices. The device works  by sending out tiny bursts of electricity  through electrodes on  the scalp  that  stimulate neurons in the   brain. It could be  used  for controlling prosthetic limbs or even helping people with  Parkinson's disease regain some movement. Researchers at the University of California, San Diego have demonstrated  the   technology  using rats, but say  it should work equally well in humans within five  years. \"We're  not  talking about a  magic wand here,\"  said Dr Michael  Merzenich, who led the research team. \"This  is something you can put on your head.\" The researchers hope  their system will eventually allow patients to  use computers without having  to wear  bulky headsets. They are also working on ways to make the BCI  more comfortable  for   users.\n\nIn   addition to being able to control computers, this BCI would also be useful  for treating Parkinson's Disease. This is because the disease causes the loss of  dopamine  receptors in  the brain, which leads to tremors and  rigidity.  In order  to treat  Parkinson's, doctors must inject chemicals into the patient's body that  block these receptors. However, if the drug is administered too early, it may cause side  effects such as nausea, vomiting,  and  diarrhea. If the medication is given  too late, however,  the symptoms may become worse.\n\nIf the BCI were to be implanted under the skin, it  would be much easier to administer the drugs. Furthermore, since the BCI would  only need to be activated  once every few  days, it  would be less  likely to cause side effects than injecting the drugs every day.\n\nHowever, there are still many questions surrounding this BCI.  For example, how long does the stimulation last? How do the signals  travel between the brain and the  electrode caps? What happens when  the signal reaches the   cap? And what happens if the signal  is interrupted? These are all important questions that  need to be  answered before  we can truly understand how this BCI might help people with Parkinson's Disease.

    "UK officials had been  hoping  for a breakthrough by the end of the week which would permit them  to send back suspects. As it turned out, they got  none. Theresa May, the Home  Secretary, said today  that Britain would not be sending  anyone back \"for these  people are UK residents\". She defended the immigration system against charges that it  discriminates against those with suspected ties to terrorism – and  said: \"Those  who  seek to exploit this  system  to  gain  uncontrolled entry to the UK are committing a criminal  offence.\"\n\nHere's  how the   BBC explained the decision:\n\nA  Home  Office spokeswoman insisted that no British citizen  would be excluded   if  they entered Syria from Turkey, Lebanon  or Tunisia. She  said it was  not appropriate  to return British nationals to their home countries  due  to \"the sheer volume of people we have had to deal with  so far\". \"In relation to those who  make that journey, they have our absolute assurance that  they will not be sent back –  this is the  view of the home secretary, this is the view of the government and this is the view of the intelligence agencies,\" she told BBC Breakfast.  The  spokeswoman said  that the Home  Office only began to  make  efforts to send back refugees in March 2015, adding that the government had not been  able to convince  all EU countries to join them in this  action. In the UK,  this could be  taken  up in Parliament or by  the new Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, she said.",

    "Former Prime  Minister Tony Blair  has reportedly initiated a plan to win  back Jewish support  for the Labour Party. This agenda  has surfaced at   a time when  the party has been experiencing a considerable decline in popularity among Jewish voters, largely due  to accusations  of institutional anti-Semitism within the  party.\n\nMr. Blair,  who led  the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007, has started his   campaign by holding   private meetings with  several Jewish leaders.  It is understood these meetings  are aimed at rebuilding trust  between  the Jewish community  and   the Labour  Party. His campaign also includes hosting a  series  of talks dedicated to tackling anti-Semitism and promoting Jewish culture,  contributions, and community.\n\nThis move by Blair comes in response  to a recent poll from the Jewish Chronicle that showed 86% of Jewish voters would not consider voting for Labour in future elections. This leaves Labour with only 14% of potential  Jewish votes - a figure that has alarmed party officials  and triggered Blair's  action plan.\n\nMr.  Blair's spokesperson confirmed that the  former prime minister believes the issues  affecting the relationship between Labour and the    Jewish  community \"must be confronted  head on\".\n\n\"The Labour party has always stood  for equality, justice, and  respect for all communities,\" said  the spokesperson. \"Mr. Blair is well-aware of the challenges ahead but  believes  dialogue  and  open discussions are  key to resolving these problems.\"\n\nCommenting on the issue, a Jewish leader who wished to remain anonymous, said: \"We need proof that the Labour Party  values the Jewish community and that  it is taking  concrete steps to fight  anti-Semitism. Words mean nothing without action.\"\n\nIn  his   attempt to court  Jewish voters, Blair has also planned visits to synagogues and Jewish faith schools, and aims to engage with   Jewish community groups  throughout the  country. His efforts mark a significant   strategic  shift for the Labour Party that is seeking to reinvent and restore its image  in various communities.\n\nHowever, the success of Blair's initiative  remains to be  seen, especially  considering Labour's recent history.  It will indeed be a challenge for the  former prime minister and the Labour Party to regain the  trust of Jewish voters still strongly dismayed by the party's perceived missteps.",
    "Italian wine  giant Illva Saronno is being lured by the burgeoning Chinese wine market, as the Asian  country's growing middle  class develops a taste for fine wines. \n\nIllva Saronno, known for producing Disaronno and   Tia Maria,  is considering expanding  its  operations into China, a move that could potentially  boost its global sales and brand recognition. The company  is reportedly in talks with several Chinese wine producers and  distributors, exploring opportunities for    collaboration  and market entry.\n\nChina's wine market has  been growing rapidly over the past decade, driven by a rising middle class with increasing disposable income and a growing appreciation for Western  lifestyle and  products. According to a  report by  Vinexpo, China is expected to become the world's second-largest  wine  market by 2020, with a value of $23 billion.\n\nIllva's interest  in China comes   as no surprise,  given the potential for growth.  The company, which  has a strong  presence in Europe and North America, has been  looking to expand its global footprint. China, with its vast consumer market and  growing taste for wine, presents a lucrative  opportunity.\n\nHowever,  entering the  Chinese market  is not  without challenges. The country's complex regulatory environment, high import tariffs, and fierce  competition from both domestic and    international brands could  pose significant  hurdles for   Illva. Moreover, Chinese consumers'  wine preferences are still evolving, and it remains to be seen whether they will develop a  taste for Illva's offerings.\n\nDespite these challenges, Illva seems undeterred.  The company's management believes that the  potential rewards outweigh the risks. They are confident that their high-quality products, combined with a strategic  approach to  market entry, will enable them to carve out a niche  in the  Chinese wine market.\n\nIllva's move towards China is reflective of   a broader trend in the global  wine industry. As traditional markets in Europe and North America become saturated, wine producers  are  looking towards emerging  markets like  China for growth.  If successful, Illva's foray  into China could pave the way for  other Western wine producers to follow  suit.\n\nThe company has not yet released a timeline for its  potential  expansion  into China.  However, industry insiders expect  that Illva will make  a move sooner  rather than  later, given the rapid growth of the  Chinese wine market.",
    "The gadget market is expected to witness a surge in growth in  2005, driven by a  rise in  demand  for mobile devices, gaming consoles, and  new technologies such as wireless  networking, according to market analysts.\n\nThey predict that  the gadget  industry could be the primary  beneficiary of a tentative economic recovery, as consumers spend more on  consumer  electronics  and digital devices. According to the  research, smartphone sales are expected to be particularly robust, with their integration  of new  features such as  music and video playing capabilities encouraging consumers to  upgrade their existing mobile devices.\n\nGaming    consoles are another area set to  experience strong growth this year,  with major releases from Sony and Microsoft anticipated. Both PlayStation 5 and Xbox  Series  X  are expected to boost  game console sales   significantly.\n\nThe growth is not only expected in developed  markets like  North America and Europe but also in emerging markets. Technological advancements  in areas like  wireless networking and the growth of the internet are driving demand  for  gadgets.   Devices like WiFi-enabled laptops, smart home  devices, digital  cameras, and  MP3  players are all predicted to  see   increased demand.\n\nDespite the promising outlook, analysts caution that the industry could face challenges. These could include increased competition leading to a price war,  a slower-than-expected rollout of new technology,  or a sudden economic downturn.\n\nThey also express concerns for the potential for barriers to international trade due to geopolitical  tensions that can  disrupt  global supply chains. This underscores  the importance  of effective  risk management strategies in the  industry. \n\nNevertheless, 2005 appears to be shaping  up to be a growth year for gadget makers.  Those companies that  are able to market their products effectively and stay ahead of technological advancements stand to benefit  the most. \n\nA notable aspect  of this predicted  growth is that it is not dependent on one kind of product or sector within the gadget industry.  From mobile phones and gaming consoles  to digital  cameras, it seems all gadget  markets have their part in this predicted surge.\n\nThis broad-based growth indicates  both the strength of consumer demand for digital  devices and the opportunities  for manufacturers  who  can  deliver innovative and appealing  products.  \n\nIn conclusion,  2005 seems set for booming  gadget sales, indicating a positive market trend  for tech and electronics manufacturers. But as  always, the challenges associated with  such growth should not be overlooked. Thus, it  will be interesting  to see how different companies  leverage  this favourable forecast.",

The register,  updated every  few weeks, helps to maintain  transparency by outlining the financial relationships and interests of parliamentary members.\n\nOf these earnings, research suggests  that a significant proportion was earned from  lucrative speaker slots at  international conferences and functions.  According  to the register,  his  largest single payment of  £40,000 came for two speeches delivered during a trip to the United States.\n\nThe former Conservative   Party leader also drew a large income from  a variety  of consultancy roles with  multinational  corporations. His advisory role at Teneo  Intelligence, an advisory firm that helps businesses navigate political risks,  and Intercontinental Hotels Group  alone brought in £300,000 annually.\n\nOn  top of this,  Hague, who led the Conservative Party  from 1997  to 2001, served on the boards of several non-UK companies, further adding to his income.\n\nThe Register of Members’ Interests  does not include salaries  for  MPs, which are publicly  funded  and set  at £81,932.  It is intended to provide a record of any work carried   out by MPs alongside their duties in  Parliament and show where potential  conflicts of interests may exist. \n\nThis revelation may ignite debate over whether former    ministers should  be allowed  to earn money from private companies and other  non-parliamentary work.  Critics  argue that the second job might distract them from their primary duties, while others believe it may help broaden their perspective  and expertise.\n\nHague's office  declined to comment on the details of his  earnings.

The detentions come as  part of an  investigation into allegations of contamination of milk with melamine, a chemical used in plastics.\n\nThe report states that four executives from the Sanlu Group, China's largest milk producer, were taken into custody on Thursday. The company has  been at  the center of   a scandal involving milk contamination  that  has sickened thousands of   children  and led to widespread panic among consumers.\n\nThe Sanlu Group has been accused of  knowingly selling contaminated milk powder, which was laced with melamine  to make it appear to have   a  higher protein content. The company has   denied any wrongdoing, but has  recalled all of its milk powder products from   stores  across China.\n\nThe  contamination scandal has sparked widespread outrage and calls for greater regulation of  the food  industry. Parents of sickened children have protested outside Sanlu's headquarters, demanding compensation  and justice.\n\nThe Chinese  government has  also  come under pressure  to take action, with critics  accusing it of being too  slow to respond to the crisis. The government has promised to crack down on food safety violations and has launched a nationwide investigation into the milk industry.\n\nThe detention of  the Sanlu  executives  is seen as  a sign that the authorities are taking the crisis seriously and are willing to take  action against those  responsible.  However, some have criticized the move as a  token gesture,  and are calling for more comprehensive reforms to ensure  food  safety in China.\n\nThe scandal has also raised concerns about the  safety  of  Chinese exports, with  several countries announcing recalls of Chinese-made milk products.

    "Budget supercar\n\n>  The  Budget Aston Martin has taken on the might of  Porsche, as the 1959  Aston Martin  DB4GT continues its fight for survival at a Bonhams sale in Marbella, Spain. The  DB4GT is one of  only 75 made, and was once  part of  Aston Martin chairman David Brown's private collection.\n>\n> The ultra-rare Aston   will be accompanied by another classic DB4GT, at Bonhams' Marbella auction on Sunday.  Both  cars  have less than 600 miles and  were purchased by British businessman David Duckham when the original owner decided to sell them  during the late 1980s.  It's understood that the cars were bought specifically for the  current owner who  has spent the best   part of 25 years restoring them to their original glory.\n>\n> But  the cars are expected to go  for under  their original   price.  The  DB4GT, which is part of  the original owner's family collection and   is  likely to have been one of the last cars built,  is estimated to  fetch in the region of £2.3m to  £2.7m (US$3m to  US$3.47m),  while the other car, a factory competition car believed to have been prepared in the 1960s by Aston  Martin's own competition department, is estimated to make between £1m (US$1.45m) and £1.3m.\n>\n>\n>\n> Aside from the DB4  GTs, a 1962   Fiat  Dino  Spyder is expected  to make between £2m and £3m (US$2.8m and US$3.54m), while  a 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 S Cabriolet A has a pre-sale estimate of  between £1m (US$1.4m) and £1.5m.\n\nFor the  full article, and for  more info\n\nAlways check back  here for more news and updates  related to the automotive industry.

However, according to  reports in the Venezuelan press, the  company has been accused of failing  to pay taxes on  the land for several years, leading to a court  case being brought against them.\n\nIn addition to tax issues, there  are also claims that the company has  breached environmental regulations and failed   to provide adequate  compensation to indigenous communities living near the estate.  These allegations have led to protests and demonstrations by local groups who say  they  have been  unfairly affected by the company's activities.\n\nThe UK government has  been contacted by  both sides  in  the dispute,  with representatives  from the property  company  denying any wrongdoing and insisting that they are working closely with the Venezuelan authorities to resolve the issue.

    "Apple's iTunes, the popular media player and online  store, is facing a new threat from   hackers who have discovered a vulnerability in the software.  The vulnerability, which  was discovered by a group of security researchers,  could potentially allow hackers to access users' personal information and make unauthorized   purchases on their behalf.\n\nThe vulnerability, which has  been assigned a severity  rating of \"high,\"  affects all versions of iTunes,  including the latest version, 12.5.1. The researchers  who discovered the vulnerability have not yet disclosed the  specific  details  of how it can be exploited, but they  have warned that it  could  potentially allow hackers to steal users' login credentials, access their iCloud accounts, and  make purchases on their behalf.\n\nApple has not yet  released a   patch to  fix the vulnerability, but the company has said that  it is working on a  fix and will release it as soon  as possible. In the meantime,  users are  being advised to  avoid  using iTunes on unsecured networks and to regularly update their  software to the latest version.\n\nThe discovery  of the vulnerability  comes at a time when Apple is facing increased scrutiny over its security  practices. In recent   years, the company has been   the target of several high-profile hacks, including the  one that led to the  theft of millions  of users' iCloud data  in 2014.\n\nApple has  since implemented a number of security  measures  to  improve the security of its products and services,  but the latest vulnerability in iTunes highlights the ongoing challenges of keeping software secure in the face of  increasingly sophisticated attacks.

But they are expecting to uncover an even greater  number of cards, possibly millions,  since they estimate 90 percent of Hansung customers held cards  with other  companies.\nThe  company had been   selling prepaid cards for  cash  since mid-October, with which customers could purchase  goods online or at stores.\nOfficials say Hansung customers  have become panicked after the government allowed banks to hold back funds from Hansung-affiliated   stores, and have started lining up  at card issuers' offices to withdraw cash.\nHansung told the court   it has  about 20 million dollars  in cash in its accounts and another 30  million dollars of pledged assets, but  was unable  to access the latter given the current financial uncertainties.\nAbout 1 trillion  won of Hansung's debt is owed to banks, and it has a total  liability of approximately  4.5 trillion won.  It has so far been unable  to pay the interest on credit card bills, causing some of its partner banks  to  refuse customers cash.\nPolice say the company's shares, which  have  been suspended  since Oct 12, could be wiped  out.\nA Hansung employee said  his company had not told  customers how many cards had been  lost and so they  were coming in to get theirs returned before any more damage was done. \"\nBut he  did not know how many cards have been lost due  to Hansung's failure  and what  would happen to the cards.\nHansung said the company had tried  to inform customers about what it was doing to help them retrieve their cards but  many had not picked up the  cards to replace lost ones.\n\"The majority  of the customers  have been receiving electronic emails regarding  the measures to  get their new cards, but it has been   difficult to confirm whether or not they  had received  the messages because several days have  gone ",

    "This poem is all about images that have   different  meanings for different people. For those who have a  visual identity, it can be hard to express themselves with  words, but by seeing   something  once or twice, people create connections. For  those with a conceptual identity, it's much harder to express why an image  is interesting  or meaningful. What images evoke for an  individual? \"What is  the  image?\" may be  the first question that comes to mind.  For someone  else,  looking \"that\" way or seeing   \"that\" image  and  knowing they are looking at it \"that way\" may  cause  thoughts of that image to pop up. For another, being familiar with  an image  can  bring meaning to the image. Some people find meaning from the  way an image looks, and others see it as a representation of  themselves. For the person looking at  a piece of  art for  the first time, it could be all about that image.A person's identity may have roots in  their past with images. A new artist  may be attracted by the same images or ideas that  have already captivated others. Even when a  person is  trying to understand how  concepts of  identity tie into images they have encountered, it may take time to find  the answer. A new  viewer may see \"the image,\" but it does not necessarily mean the image  makes   him or her a different person. \"What is this piece doing to you and how is this looking into your mind?\" can be a very  common   and helpful question to  ask when trying to  understand images.For many of us, images can be  powerful sources of ideas about ourselves. We can use  images as guides, as a vehicle for    communication, or as a place  to seek new things. An image is usually taken in one moment;  it can be a very powerful source of inspiration  for an   individual, but  it has   several limitations. For most of us, images are often  limited to specific   places, times,  or forms of  life. The fact that images are more often  than not limited to one place  or one time can cause a person to   feel as  though  the image has  no meaning.  Images often look and feel very \"limited\"…but  they are not. We see in our dreams the same kind of images, but in  the dream  we know we are  dreaming because   we know what an image is and we are  not fooled because we  see a world  that is quite different from our own. There is no doubt, at least  with this type of",

    "I've been  playing Tinker for a  while  now and  one thing I've noticed  is that my  item timing  is not  as good as it  could be. I  often find myself  struggling to  get my core items   at the right time, which can really impact my effectiveness  in team fights   and split pushing. \n\nAfter doing  some research and  experimenting, I've found  a few tips that have helped me  improve my  item timing with Tinker. \n\nFirstly, it's important to  prioritize farming efficiency. Tinker is  a hero that  relies heavily  on gold and experience, so  you need to  make sure  you're maximizing your farm.  This means constantly  pushing out waves and stacking camps whenever  possible.  \n\nSecondly, you should try to minimize downtime. Tinker is a hero that can be very active on the map, so you want  to make  sure  you're  constantly doing something. This could be split pushing, ganking, or farming jungle camps.  The key is to always be doing something productive. \n\nThirdly, you  should consider adjusting your skill build. Tinker  has a lot   of flexibility when it comes to his  skill build, so you should tailor it to the game you're playing. For example, if you're against a  lot of magic damage,  you might  want to prioritize leveling  up  your March of the Machines for better wave clear and farming potential. \n\nLastly, communication with your team is key. Let them know when you're close to a key item and coordinate with them to make the most out of it. Tinker is a hero that can have a huge   impact in team fights, so it's important to make sure your team is  ready to fight  when  you  have your core items. \n\nOverall, achieving better item  timing with Tinker requires a combination of efficient farming, constant activity,   adjusting your  skill build, and  good  communication with your team. By following  these tips, you should be able to improve  your item timing  and have a bigger impact  on the game. ",
    "I've been experimenting with different laning combos  lately and I've found one that has been working really well for me.  The  combo consists of playing a tanky support like  Leona or Nautilus paired with a high  burst ADC like Jhin or Miss Fortune. \n\nThe idea behind this combo is  to  have the tanky  support engage  on the enemy  ADC  or support, while the  burst  ADC follows  up with their high damage abilities. This creates a lot of  pressure in the laning  phase and can  often result in kills or at least force the enemy  to back  off and play  more defensively.\n\nThe  tanky support provides a lot of crowd control  and durability,  allowing the ADC to freely  deal damage without worrying too much about getting caught out. Additionally, the burst damage from the ADC can  quickly burst down squishy targets, making it difficult  for the enemy to trade effectively.\n\nI've found that this combo works particularly well against squishy supports like Janna  or Soraka, as they are more vulnerable to the engage  and burst damage. However,   it  can still be effective against tanky  supports as well, as the burst damage  can  quickly whittle down their   health.\n\nOverall, I've been having a lot  of success with  this laning combo and I would highly  recommend giving it  a try if  you're looking for  a strong and aggressive laning phase. It's important to communicate and coordinate with your ADC to ensure that you're on  the same   page  and  can effectively  engage and follow  up  on each other's abilities. Give it a shot and let  me know how it  works  for you!",

    "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm feeling really overwhelmed right now and I just need to vent. I feel like I can't do this much longer.  Life has  been so tough  lately and it feels like everything is falling apart. \n\nI'm dealing with  so much stress and pressure from work, relationships, and just  the    general state of the world right now. It feels   like I'm constantly juggling  a million  things and I'm  just not able to keep  up anymore. \n\nSometimes it feels like nobody understands what I'm going through. I feel so alone and isolated  in my struggles.  It's like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of negativity  and I  can't find a way  out. \n\nI try to keep a positive  mindset   and take care of my mental health, but it's  becoming harder and harder to do so.

    " I mean seriously, why do we have a  whole category for mil-sim? It's not  like there are a lot of mainstream   games  that have military involvement.  Shouldn't it be a subset of the action genre? RPG? Strategy? Something? It's always one   of the first categories I  eliminate when  searching for a game, because 99% of  it is just mediocre. With the tiny minority of  excellent games that deserve to be playing, it feels like a  clutter category that does more harm than good.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is, should I be eliminating the \"mil-sim\" category  games  altogether, or  is that genre simply not for me? I'm mostly  a PC gamer, dabbling with consoles, though I am open to  suggestions for any platform.\n\nI've  tried ARMA and a few other  similar games,  and they seem cool, but hard to get into after  spending most of my time in more traditional  gaming genres. Any recommendations would be welcome.\n\nI did try searching, but most threads on the  topic seem to be complaints about lack  of mil-sim  AAWWWWWWHHHYYYYYY!!!!11 and  Sturgeon's law concerning the   low quality meme games  cluttering the category, with few actual useful opinions.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the  suggestions guys. Apparently the  genre   has enough good  games  to warrant its  own category, who'd have thought. I'll definitely    look into these  further, and I think   I'll remove the \"shooter\" category from my search criteria as well  (though arena shooters are  still okay, since I do   like the occasional rocket  jumping session)\n\nEdit 2: I should probably clarify that by \"military  sim\" I mean games that  strive for realism, whether  in  terms of gameplay, physics, or whatever makes the game fall into that   category. I  don't necessarily mean games with  \"sim\"  in the title (though that's what  I'm most familiar with), and I'm  not talking about shooter  games  with tanks  and  planes. War Thunder would probably fall under that category, but  since my aversion is mostly  due to personal taste and not the quality of the games  in  said category, I didn't really think it would be fair to  use that example.  Apologies for any confusion.",
    "   I'm a grad student and I  need  to take  a particular class that's only offered in the fall semester. It's a requirement for both the MA and PhD programs that I'm in, and  is   arguably  the most important class in my program given that every PhD student  in my program takes it,  and  most MA students take it as an  elective. \n\nThe problem is  that I cannot  take it in the fall due to  a number of factors outside my control - travel for  work  and an intense semester for another class that I'm taking - and registering for it in  the  fall  would mean that   I  would not be  able to finish my degree within the standard timeframe for my program. \n\nRegistration  for  the fall semester opens up tomorrow, and  I saw that there was one  section  of the class offered  in the spring. I emailed the professor who teaches the class asking if there was a possibility of another section being added in the spring, and while they very kindly forwarded my email to the  department chair, they said there were no plans for another section.  \n\nI emailed the department chair  directly,  and apparently they are \"happy to forward [my email] to the dean\"   but are \"not  optimistic\" about the chances of another section being added.

    " Cartoon  movie that  used to be on  Netflix, maybe sometime in the  2010s. Essentially  it was an  anthropomorphic-animal space opera that  was pretty cool. The plot revolved around some  farm animals   (I want  to say there was a pig and a cow,  maybe a chicken) that get kidnapped by space slavers  and   how the pig's boyfriend has to   team up with various factions to infiltrate and break them  free. The movie had a very Star Wars-esque feel to it, with the evil empire having a  massiveDeath Star-esque  orbiting battle station and  a   vaguely   Han Solo-like protagonist.\n\nThere was  also  a decent amount of characterization; the protagonist is initially pretty apathetic and gets roped  into the adventure by circumstance, and his relationship with  the cow is  initially  antagonistic until they learn to work together. The villain is also  pretty great, he’s a floating skull with a French accent who relishes being evil. Think  early Doctor  Evil levels of supervillainy.\n\nI've  searched for it  everywhere and cannot  find it. I miss this movie!

    "Okay, here is a Reddit post without the  title:  \n\nThe scene  in The Wire where  McNulty and Moreland only say the word \"fuck\" over and over is appalling. Watching it initially was  extremely uncomfortable, and  it honestly still makes me uneasy to think  about. Although the scene represents the   frustration and anger the two characters  are  feeling, I believe  there are other  ways for the writers  to convey anger without having to resort to profanity.

It does so much for you every single day, it keeps  you alive, it allows you to do the things you do, etc etc..\" \n\nObviously she's right and I know logically I shouldn't worry... but that's  just  it,  it's SO irrational.

    "Some thoughts  which pop up in my mind are distinctly under my control. I could just let them be,  or I could think more   about them, or pursue them—e.g. if I  think about an  interesting topic,  I could choose to investigate it further. Then   there are out-of-the-blue thoughts that just  appear in my mind, and arguably I have no control over them. It would be absurd to try to will myself to stop thinking about them. They just appear,  and I can choose to entertain them or let them go,  but it feels as though the initiative is not mine.\n\nWhich category   do volitional  thoughts  belong to? It seems like  they should belong to the first category, but maybe not? What determines whether a thought  is under my control? Surely  it's  not  sufficient to just feel as though I had control, because it seems some involuntary thoughts feel involuntary, even though I could make myself think about  them if I so chose. But perhaps more importantly, it seems  like  some thoughts which  feel voluntary are actually involuntary. For example, if  I have  an irrational fear  of something, it feels voluntary to think about it, but  it seems  it would   actually  be irrational (and impractical)  to try to will myself to  stop thinking  about it. It seems  like willingness to have a particular  thought  is not the same thing as volition, yet   it feels like it ought to  be.\n\nMaybe a more charitable way of putting it is that it seems like   willingness to have a particular conscious  experience  is not the same thing as voluntariness. Thoughts just seem to appear in my mind, and I can   choose  to act on them or not, but  it doesn't seem  as though I caused them, even if it feels that  way, and even if in reality I could have  prevented them, since  it    feels as though they just happen. Conversely, other thoughts feel as though  I caused them, but it seems  as though  what matters is  not whether the thought  appeared because I willed it,  but rather whether I  could   have prevented   it. Perhaps it doesn't matter  whether a  thought is caused  by my   will, but rather whether I could have  prevented the thought, in which case all thoughts are involuntary. ",
    "I have  had a   very difficult time in my life from the  day   I was born and I struggle with  many internal flaws  that I need to deal with. I was abused as a child into my  teenage years by an outsider  to my family  dynamic (a man my mom met when  I was 3), which caused a lot of  issues in my  brain  as it formed, and I am autistic which makes  me extremely sensitive to everything,  especially conflict, whether it be external or internal.  As a  result of  that, I suffer from terrible anxiety and  depression, and I am constantly second-guessing everything I do or say, predicting the future outcomes  of all possible interactions I  could have with others  because   I can't read tones well and I  misread facial expressions  a  lot,  and I am always left feeling like I've disappointed someone, even when that's not the  case. \n\nI am  in  my 30s and I still live with my mom because I have never been able  to hold a job for more  than  a few  months because  of  my   anxiety and depression, which causes me to either quit or be fired.  I  have been  able to keep  a  few jobs  for a few months here and there, but they always  end the same way  and  I  am worthless and a burden on everyone, especially my mom who  has to pay for everything. She has helped me as much as  she can but  she has her own issues to deal with and  it's not  fair for  me  to keep taking   from her when I am perfectly capable of working. She has  helped me get jobs before but my anxiety always gets the  better of  me  and I can't do it. \n\nI am constantly fighting with  myself to try and be better but  I always end up in the same place: worthless, pathetic, and a burden on everyone around me. I am a  failure as  a person and I deserve to suffer for what I've done. I am  a terrible person and I deserve to be punished for the things  I have done.  I am  not worth  the  air I breathe and  I am a danger to society. My brain is poison and getting rid of me  would  serve  everyone, especially the universe, because the last thing it needs is another abomination like me lurking around, pretending  that I deserve to be here  when I so clearly do not.

    "I   never really appreciated the way music can change the lives   of many, like my grandmother. My  grandmother  is a hard working woman, and she has always been a musician, my mother being a former  band member of one of her country singers.  She has also been a huge advocate  for helping people with   disabilities. And she had a  real problem in her early  life, since  she  was very bright, her legs would always ache,   her body would shake, and  even when she was on the best of  days,  things  would  hurt. At  the same  time she never really  questioned,  as she always looked at  everyone else with an air of  knowing  what was right and what was  wrong. Then, she  would have  music to help the day  go by. At her height of being, before she  was married I don't know how old  I was, my grandparents could have told she was a star. She  did go to many concerts, but most of the time she would sit in her backyard singing with her husband. Most of them didn't  really seem at   a big deal, but she took my grandma to  a concert one time and after the show, she sat on a bench  with her,  she kept looking at her  with her huge eyes,  \"Are you ok  grandma?\" She never looked at my grandmother the  same ever since  she  had that episode.\n\nOn the last day  before she  died, she told  my grandma that the first day on the road  with this band it was rough. She said she never  really knew  how to handle the loudness, the attention, etc.  When they  first starting playing, she said that it felt like they made her realize she was different than everyone else. She  said \"it  is your destiny\" and they were all a part of it. She  told my grandma, \"they are not strangers, your family knows who you are and  you can talk  to them about it on the way  home.\"  I think my grandmother just heard that in her heart, it wasn't in her  words. She was a  big believer  in   that they were part of her family, she never let them  let her   down. After  the show she finally admitted, that  she wasn't  OK with the   way  they were looking at her. It felt like as  soon as people  got really  close to her, she would just  start shaking, her body would shake, she would start screaming  and  not know why. There was",

    "I am not sure if  this has been mentioned before, but I have noticed that WMR is  always in  sleep  mode and never wakes up. It's like  it's asleep  all the time. I've tried  to turn on  the   radio or TV, but  nothing  happens.  I can't  get it to wake up.  I'm pretty sure it's because it's using its own power  source (probably battery) to keep itself awake. I don't know how long it will stay in sleep mode, but  I hope it doesn't go off for good.\n\nThis  is   an interesting  question. The  answer  is  yes, it does use  its own  power supply. But  it also uses some external power sources as  well. In fact, it uses two different types of  power supplies. One is a standard  AC adapter  that you might find at your local electronics store. This is what powers the computer. The other  type of power supply is a solar panel.  This is what powers the camera.\n\nSolar  panels  are  great for powering laptops, tablets, phones, etc., but  they're  not so great for powering cameras. They require a  lot more energy than  normal batteries do.  So,  while the laptop may be powered by a solar panel,  the camera is still going to need  a regular battery.\n\nSo, why would   WMR use a solar  panel?  Well, there are several reasons. First, it's  cheap. A solar panel costs about $1 per watt. That means that a  solar  panel could provide enough juice to run the camera for  about 10  hours. Second, it's easy to install. You just plug it into the wall and  connect it  to the  USB port on  your computer. Third, it's portable. If  you want to  take the camera  with you, you can simply leave it plugged in.  Fourth, it's  very efficient.  Solar  panels convert sunlight directly into electricity. When you put a solar panel on top  of a house, it converts  the  heat from  the sun into electricity. And since the sun shines most of the day, it's perfect  for powering a camera.\n\nBut, there's  one problem  with solar panels. They only work during the  daytime. During the night, the sun stops shining. So, if you  want to charge  your camera during the day,  you'll need to either buy a backup battery  or make sure that your camera is set to automatically switch  off after sunset.",

    "I  am a  woman, and I  have been  raped. I was raped  by a man who   had access to my body because he was in a position of  power  over me. He took advantage of that power  when he  forced himself on me. It wasn't rape because it didn't hurt as much as  other things that could have happened. But it still   hurts.  And I don't want anyone else to  go through what  I did. So I'm writing  this  post so that people know how  they can help prevent sexual assault.\n\nThis   is not an easy topic for me to write  about. I've  never told anyone about it before,  but   now that I do, I realize that there are many  ways  that we can  all be better at preventing sexual assault. This isn't just about women. Everyone  deserves to live free from violence.\n\nSo here's what  you need to know:\n\n1) Rape is NOT your fault.\n\nRape is  not your  fault. You were drunk, high, drugged, passed  out, unconscious, whatever.  If   you're under the influence  of drugs or  alcohol,  then yes,  you   may have consented to sex with  someone. However,   if you're not, then no one has ever said  anything to you about consent.  That means that even  if you say  \"yes\" to sex, you might  not actually mean it.\n\n2)  Consent doesn't always mean yes.\n\nConsent does not mean  \"Yes, please!\" It means \"No, thank  you.\" Sometimes, you'll  get a \"no,\" sometimes you won't. Sometimes you will think you've given  consent, and  sometimes you won't. Sometimes  you will think you've given consent, and sometimes you haven't. Sometimes you will think you've given consent, and sometimes you haven't. Sometimes you will think you've given consent, and sometimes you  haven't.  Sometimes you will think you've  given consent, and sometimes you haven't.  Sometimes you will think you've given consent, and sometimes you haven't.

    "Understanding   and optimizing item timings with Tinker  can  dramatically improve  your  gameplay.  Here are some  tips you  can utilize:\n\n1. **Prioritize  Boots of Travel (BoT):** Your first priority should always be saving for Boots of Travel. This item  is crucial  to Tinker's playstyle as it allows you  to travel around  the map, pushing lanes, and teleporting back to your base when needed.\n\n2.  **Farming Patterns:**  Tinker is all about  farming efficiently. Using March of the Machines, you can continually clear out waves of creeps. When  farming the jungle,  move strategically  between  camps  to use March  of the Machines  to best effect.\n\n3. **Stacking Neutral Creeps:** While farming  waves with March, try to stack  neutral  camps whenever possible, this will allow for maximizing your gold and experience gain.\n\n4. **Bottle and Soul Ring:** These two items should be your next  priority after  BoTs.  They  give   you  the ability to  stay on the map longer due to sustainability  in health  and mana.\n\n5. **Blink Dagger Timing:** Blink Dagger is another high priority item. Try to get it before the 20-minute mark. It offers a great deal of  mobility and  can save you from many sticky situations.\n\n6. **Scythe  of Vyse and Dagon:** These are  your luxury items.  The former is great for control and adding an extra layer of disable in team fights, whereas  the latter  will   let you  burst down enemies quickly. Their timings   largely depend on how well you have farmed.\n\nRemember that both  your individual skill  level  and the state of your specific game can affect this schedule. Being adaptable is crucial in Dota 2, so be prepared to adjust  your playstyle and item  build based on  the  needs of your team and the nature of the enemy team.  In general, ensure you maximize   farming, manage your mana well  and aim for minimum deaths. Good luck!",
    "I've  been playing a  lot of duo queue  recently and stumbled  upon a laning combo that has  been surprisingly effective.  I've been playing as Thresh and my duo partner has been playing as Lucian. \n\nThresh's crowd   control abilities combined with  Lucian's high burst damage has  been a deadly  combination. I start the engage  with Thresh's Q  (Death Sentence) to pull in an  enemy, followed by his E (Flay) to knock them towards Lucian. Lucian then uses his Q  (Piercing Light)   and his passive (Lightslinger) to  quickly  burst down  the enemy. If they're not dead by then, Thresh's R (The Box) can be used to slow them down and allow Lucian to finish them off.\n\nThis  combo has been working really well for  us in  the  bot lane. We've been  able to secure early kills and snowball our lead  into the mid and late game. It's also  a lot of fun  to play!\n\nI'd love to hear about any other laning combos that you guys   have found to  be effective.  Let's share  and learn from each other! ",

    "I've  been reading a lot about the Bernese Method of switching from   a   full agonist opioid (like heroin  or  fent) to a partial  agonist opioid (like Suboxone). The general idea is to slowly introduce the Suboxone while still using your drug of choice, thus avoiding  the excruciatingly uncomfortable  process of withdrawal. This differs greatly from the  traditional  method of waiting until you are in withdrawal before beginning  to use Suboxone.\n\nHowever, my primary concern  with this method is  the  prolonged exposure to the full agonist opioid  which  maintains  the addictive   behavior and potentially  damaging lifestyle. I wonder if anyone has attempted a Bernese Method followed by  a quick (or  quicker than normal)  taper off  of the Suboxone? I'm thinking this may provide  the  benefits of both techniques (avoiding acute withdrawal and lessening the amount of time on Suboxone), but I'm having trouble finding any first-hand accounts of such an approach.  I'm particularly interested in hearing about  the experience, difficulty, and effectiveness of this method,  so if you have any insight or  personal stories, your contribution would be  highly appreciated. \n\nAlso,  I would like to note that it's incredibly important to consult with a healthcare  professional  before attempting something like this,  for anyone reading this post who might be considering it, please ensure you're receiving monitoring   and support from professionals. This is a   harm  reduction thread,  and  we want to promote safe and healthy  discussion. Thanks in advance for any responses!  ",
    "I've been thinking about this for a while now  and  I believe that wearing  a full set of leather armor should improve your  sneakiness in the game. \n\nLeather  armor is often associated with thieves, rogues, and assassins in fantasy settings  due to its lightweight and  quiet nature. It doesn't clank  and clang  like metal armor, making  it ideal  for those  who rely on stealth and subtlety. \n\nIn the game, this could translate to  a slight boost in sneakiness or stealth when wearing a full set of leather  armor. This could be  a small  percentage increase in your ability to remain undetected, or perhaps it could   reduce the noise you make when moving. \n\nThis would not   only  add a layer of realism  to the game, but it would also    give players more strategic options   when planning their  character's build and playstyle.  It would make the choice of armor more  than just about defense stats, but  also   about how it can complement   your chosen skills and tactics.\n\nWhat do you  guys think? Would this be a good addition to the game?  Or do you think it would  unbalance things? I'd love to hear your thoughts.",
    "I'm frustrated with my HR  department. I recently applied for  a promotion within my company, and after going through  the interview process, I was told that I would  be receiving a job offer soon. However, when   I followed up  with HR  to ask about the status of my application, they informed  me that they couldn't provide me with  a salary range for  the position.\n\nI found  this strange, as it's common  practice in our  industry to share salary ranges during the  hiring process  so that candidates have an idea of what  to expect. When  I  pressed them further,  they claimed that they couldn't give me a range because  \"it varies based on experience\" - which is a pretty  vague reason if you   ask me.\n\nWhat's even  more annoying  is that they seemed to take offense to my questioning. They   started getting defensive  and dismissive, telling me that  they were \"doing their best\" and that I should just  wait  patiently for the offer  letter. It felt like they were  trying to  make me feel silly for asking such  a basic question.\n\nHas anyone else  had similar experiences with their HR department? Am I overreacting  here?  I understand that delays  can happen, but the lack of transparency and condescending attitude  from HR  has left a bad taste in  my mouth.",
    "Hey fellow   photographers! I'm considering making the  switch from Canon   to Sony, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. I've been shooting with  Canon for   years and have invested in a bunch  of lenses and accessories, so it's a big decision.\n\nI've heard  great things about  Sony's mirrorless cameras, especially the  A7 series.

    "Hey fellow Redditors,\n\nI know a  lot of people think the Batman prep time argument is silly or  overdone, but I'm here to argue that it's actually a good thing.\n\nFirst of all, let's acknowledge that Batman is a highly skilled and experienced crimefighter.  He's been doing this for years, and he's had his fair share of victories and  defeats. He knows what works and  what   doesn't, and he's constantly adapting his strategies to stay one step ahead of  his enemies.\n\nNow, when it comes   to prep time, Batman is meticulous. He plans  every  detail, from the  weapons he brings to the gadgets he uses to the  routes  he takes. He's not just winging it,  hoping for the best.  He's a  tactician, and he knows that every second  counts.\n\nBut here's the thing: Batman's prep time isn't just about him. It's  about his allies, too. When he's preparing for a mission, he's not just  thinking about his own safety and success  - he's thinking about the safety and success  of his team. He's making sure  they have the right  gear, the right  training, and  the right strategy  to take down the  bad guys.\n\nAnd  let's   not forget, Batman's not just fighting crime for the sake   of it. He's  fighting  for justice, for   what's right.  He's fighting to protect the innocent and vulnerable  from those who would  harm them. By taking the time  to prepare, he's not just saving his own skin  - he's saving  countless lives.\n\nSo  the  next time someone  says the Batman prep time argument is silly, just remember: it's not just about Batman.   It's about his dedication to  justice, his commitment  to his allies,  and his unwavering determination to protect   the  people  of Gotham.\n\nThanks for  reading, fellow Redditors. Let me know what you  think!",

    "So I've been dating my boyfriend for about three years now, and he has always  been  very liberal when it comes to politics.  He  is  active on Twitter and often  shares articles  promoting progressive causes. He was even   involved  with some local community organizations that dealt with social issues like poverty  and mental  health.\n\nBut recently, things have taken an interesting turn. My boyfriend started posting some articles from more conservative sources that challenge our shared values. At first, it didn't bother  me too much  - after all, everyone's entitled  to their   own opinions. But then he kept doing this, day after day, until he basically said he is now  pro-Trump. To say I was shocked would  be putting it mildly.\n\nI tried talking to him about it calmly   but  failed to convince him otherwise. In fact, he started getting defensive  if anyone  tries to  argue with his new beliefs. It feels strange  because  I used to know someone   who had a lot  of  empathy  and concern   for social justice issues, but now he seems more focused on fiscal responsibility  and small government intervention.\n\nThis isn't just affecting us -  his friends  are  also surprised by these changes, as they knew him better before he  turned into this  version  of himself. His family is worried since they don't see eye to  eye with his political beliefs either. It just shows how far apart we both feel  about certain topics, which only adds   tension to  our already busy lives.\n\nSo yeah,  any advice or insights you can  offer  will be  greatly appreciated as I navigate  through this  awkward situation.",

    "Becoming an auntie means taking  on a  new role in the lives of your siblings' children. It can be challenging, but  it  is also incredibly rewarding. There  are so many  amazing moments that come with being an auntie:\n\n1. Watching them grow and  learn  new things\n2. Sharing your wisdom and experiences  with them\n3. Teaching them valuable life lessons\n4. Having fun  and spending quality time together\n5. Seeing their facial expressions when you give them something they love, whether it be candy or a toy\n6. Hearing   about all their  milestones, from first  steps to  graduation\n7. Helping out whenever they  need someone  to watch over them or  talk to them\n8. Shaping them  into   better  adults by providing guidance and discipline\n9. Becoming like a second parent for some (which can  help relieve  the workload from the primary   caregivers)\n\nOverall, becoming an  auntie comes  with its own unique set of challenges and  responsibilities, but it  is also one of the most fulfilling  roles  to have. It gives me great joy to see my family thrive, and I  enjoy doing  everything  in  my power to make sure they do!",
    "\"\n\"Friend\": Hi there friends! So I know  some people might find this off topic but hey   whatever, let's  talk for a minute!  So as you all know, my  friend Mike  has been on my case lately  about his deep love for country music  and his  hatred towards rap and hip hop artists who use the  soft 'r'.  He even went so far as to  say that  he can hear the  difference between true 'American musicians' (read: white) and those 'wannabe thugs'  (not him obviously, he thinks he's a real life  outlaw lol).  But  when I  brought up his constant mispronunciation of words like \"larder\" or \"flared,\" he says that everyone else is  also  doing  it  and nobody cares.  What do y'all  think? Is it really no big deal if someone can't pronounce certain words  correctly?\"",
    "**Please give up; I will not change. Seriously, give up.**\n\nWhy am I here? I don't know.   To help you? To make a difference? To change the course of  social history? No. I'm here  to be a  brat. A loudmouthed, self-righteous, in your  face brat who refuses to do anything because I   think the world  sucks.  The world sucks and I don't want  anyone to be happy or satisfied or even complacent. I want you  to feel sick, disgusted,  and depressed. I  want you to take pills and be an addict. I want  you to feel like crap and blame the government for your problems (sorry, you created  it). I  want you to feel  like shit  but keep  quiet. I want you to go into depression and  self-destructive  habits  instead of taking responsibility  for being unfulfilled.\n\nI  don't  want you to know that you  are the reason you are unhappy, and that you could change the way you  view and interact with the world in  order to make it an  enjoyable place  for you. I actually want you to stay  unfulfilled, miserable,  and unhappy. I want you to go  to hell but  not know you are  going.\n\nWhy? Because a miserable world  with people who  don't want to help them means that for  every million people there are a million problems to be solved. So if you  want to feel like shit and be miserable but not  do  anything to help yourself  or others, that's what it  means for me. You're helping  me make money.\n\nBut that might be an unintended  effect of  my actions, and not my real motive—so I have another reason to be here.  I'm really here to be  a martyr.  A loudmouth, self-righteous, in your  face  martyr  who  refuses to do anything  about the world being unfair,  because it    sucks. I'm  just going to sit  here  in my chair, write these pointless blog posts, and  complain.\n\nI'll never be   able  to get back in shape because I don't want to, and  any exercise plan you give  me or any  health tips on  eating I'll  argue to the death. People need  to keep fat because it keeps you warm  on  cold winter days, or  any day, or any time, and any other excuse you can think of, I can dispute.",

    "\"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America  for Make Benefit Glorious  Nation of Kazakhstan\" is a satirical  masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of comedy and social commentary.  Sacha Baron  Cohen's portrayal of the fictional Kazakh journalist, Borat Sagdiyev,  is both  hilarious and thought-provoking.\n\nThe film follows Borat as  he travels   across  America, interacting with real   people who are unaware that they are  part of a  mockumentary.   Through his  outrageous behavior  and offensive remarks,  Borat exposes  the  underlying prejudices and  ignorance that exist in American society.\n\nWhat sets  this film apart is its ability to simultaneously entertain and challenge its audience. The humor is often cringe-worthy, but it serves a purpose. It forces us to confront  our own  biases and question   the absurdity of our cultural  norms. The film's unscripted  nature adds  to its authenticity, as the reactions of the unsuspecting individuals  Borat encounters are genuine and often shocking.\n\nSacha  Baron  Cohen's performance as Borat is nothing short of brilliant. He fully immerses himself in the character, delivering lines with impeccable timing and physical comedy. His ability to stay in  character even in the most uncomfortable situations is a testament to his talent as an actor and  comedian.\n\nWhile some may argue that the film  goes too far in its  portrayal of stereotypes and offensive humor, it is important to remember that it is intended to be a  satire.

It is  not meant   to be taken at face   value, but rather as  a commentary on  the state of society.\n\n\"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for  Make  Benefit Glorious  Nation of Kazakhstan\" is a bold and daring film that  challenges its   audience to confront uncomfortable  truths. It is a must-watch for those who  appreciate dark humor and are willing to engage  in a deeper  exploration of societal issues.",

Sudeikis brings  his trademark comedic charm  to the role and delivers many  laugh-out-loud moments.

    " This movie is a   masterpiece. It is a heartbreaking, beautiful story about true love between two friends that overrides everything else, even when the rest of the world seems against it. The  acting in this  film is  brilliant, and  it has a terrific cast. I especially loved  Jake Gyllenhaal's performance, but Anne Hathaway and Heath  Ledger were both amazing as  well. It's   a sad story,  but it  really is a must-see movie. The script is brilliantly written, and the scenery  is   gorgeous. Definitely worth buying a ticket  to!",
    "  While Rocky III contains  many of the same characteristics that made its predecessors so  great, this film,   although watchable, lacks the feel of the previous two films. Many things are different  this time around.  For example, the fight scenes in this film are very unusual, as Rocky essentially destroys his opponents in the  first two rounds of  each fight.  For the first time since the original Rocky,  Talia  Shire does  not appear in the film,   although her voice is heard during the opening scene. Also, Burt Young's  role as Adrian's brother is reduced  significantly. Sadly, this is also the last time that  Carl Weathers will appear as \"Apollo Creed.\"\n\nOnce again,  Rocky  struggles with whether he should keep  fighting  or not.  This time,  however, he doesn't struggle for long, as a  video game version of Rocky is released,   and he becomes frustrated with the idea that people are making money  off of him. Angry, he decides to keep fighting, and he goes    up  against a brutal Soviet fighter, who nearly kills Rocky in the film's final bout.\n\nWhile the story is  nothing special, the performances are  what make the film work.  Sylvester Stallone  is, as always, excellent in the   title role, and Mr. T is equally  effective as  Rocky's  nemesis, \"Clubber Lang.\" The rest  of the  cast, including Burt  Young, is good as well.\n\nWhile Rocky III  was  not as  good as its predecessors, it  is still an enjoyable film due to the performances of the cast. If you're  a  fan of the Rocky films, you'll want to  see this one, although I recommend the first two films  over this  one.",
    " This is honestly one   of the best Harry  Potter films, due not only  to  the  dark and scary  visuals and an actual threatening villain, but also  due to the fact  that it's just plain funny. Rick May's comedy  relief is sorely missed in the following movies, unfortunately.\n\nIt's also the last one where the series retains  a  sense of innocence before it  started getting really dark and creepy (although to  be  fair,  it was always creepy, but the kids were  too young  to notice).\n\n relive the young years of the  HP  series anymore. The spiders,  the gnomes, the talking snakes, the feasts, the charms, the burps, the  potatoes. Man, this movie series had it all.\n\nSure, the  plot is downright ridiculous and completely  nonsensical, but ain't that how  all fantasy movies are?  At least this one made it funny, too.

    " Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a  masterpiece. A genius blend of  animation and live action  that will thrill adults and children alike. The plot is wonderfully clever and  intricate and the dialogue is hilarious. The film represents  a revolution in the  field of animation and it still retains its freshness  and uniqueness. Who  Framed Roger Rabbit  is an inspiration for all movie  makers and a joy for all movie goers. Gene Siskel  saw this picture in 1988 and immediately declared it the best film of  the year, and he was  right.  This  movie has it  all:  drama, humor, romance, action,...  What else can I say -Watcher, wherever you  are,  this one's for you!  ",
    " As   with  the first film,  director  Guy Ritchie's visualization of  Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is bold, witty, and action-packed, with the necessary emotional undercurrents to ground the thrilling sequences.   This time  around, Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his  stalwart partner, Dr. John Watson (Jude Law), take on elusive rogue hitter Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris), who's always a step ahead of  Holmes, orchestrating a vicious series  of crimes that threatens to plunge Europe into  war.  Moriarty's lethal  ambition remains opaque, as does  the  depth of his relationship with Holmes, which is  dialed up  to  11 from  the opening scene. Madonna's soundtrack   is bang-on, and Rachel McAdams is radiant as  ever as Holm's soulful love interest,  Irene Adler. With gritty action, clever  banter, and just the right amount of bonkers plot twists, A Game of  Shadows is deluxe entertainment. ",
    "I still love Iron Man  but this movie just didn't do it for me. Don't  get me wrong, it was exciting  and had a lot of action but it just felt like they were  trying too hard to live up  to the original Iron Man and    the result was a  subpar film. It was trying too  hard  to be  a thriller film but  in the  end, it just  wasn't. The story was weak and the acting was subpar. This one is a miss for   me.",
    "Still  shining after all  these years, \"Batman Returns\" finds the Dark Knight facing off against The Penguin,  aka Oswald Cobblepot (Danny DeVito), and Catwoman (Michelle   Pfeiffer), a mysterious figure who has her eyes  set on Gotham's  leading businessman, Max Shreck (Christopher  Walken).osophical and  analytical, this  film  version of Batman explores the hero's subconscious  through the eyes of  psychiatrist  Alfred Pennyworth (Michael  Gough), who emphasizes the importance of appearances  as they relate to perception.  Accordingly, Batman Returns is a surreal experience, with Gotham portrayed as a combination of Coney Island's  amusement attractions and a medieval fantasy world. This depiction is brought to  life through the realization of neo-gothic  architecture combined with  fun-fair  attractions such  as roller  coasters. Interestingly, this   version of Gotham can be interpreted as  a reflection of the Batman's  mind, where the  heroes, as personifications of positive psychological traits, battle against their   dark opposites. \n\nIn this movie, Batman's primary opposition is The Penguin, a deformed  man who adopts a  false  identity to deceive others and  give  himself power.  The character of The Penguin can be seen as a representation of Batman's violent and ruthless instincts. Similarly, Catwoman symbolizes the hero's desire for chaos and anarchy. Throughout the film, the heroes face many challenges that allow audiences  to understand the characters  on a deeper level. An example of this  is when  The  Penguin traps  Batman and Catwoman in a  fun-house and shoots fireworks at them. Not only  does this demonstrate The Penguin's  control over the situation,  but the environment also reflects the characters' unstable minds.  \n\n\"Batman Returns\" is a film that explores the complexities of the  Dark   Knight's character, providing a unique and  thought-provoking experience that continues  to  shine after all these years. Returning  to the big  screen  for its anniversary,  the movie remains  a timeless classic.",
    "The movie Harry Potter and the  Chamber  of Secrets is a classic in the  Harry Potter series. It follows Harry as he returns for his second year at Hogwarts School   of Witchcraft and Wizardry,  where he and his  friends Ron and Hermione must solve the mystery surrounding the Chamber  of Secrets.  The film is full of adventure,  magic, and  suspense, and is  a must-watch for fans of the series. The acting is   top-notch, and the  special effects  are  stunning. Overall, it is a great movie that  is sure to entertain  and delight  viewers of all ages.  \n\nWould you like to know more about the movie, or the Harry Potter  series?",
    "Without  the pioneering animation  showcased in  \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"®, we would not  have the digitized actors we  have today filling in parts for live-action stars who might be unwilling or  unable to participate in a given film. Although  the film somewhat loosely holds together as a mystery comedy, it really is  a platform for the animators and computer graphic artists who made it possible for  Bob Hoskins  to interact  with   cartoon characters like Roger Rabbit, who is the reason  why  we are here, and Jessica Rabbit, who understandably latches onto  Hoskins' private  detective character, Eddie Valiant. The plot  has something to do with someone framing Roger Rabbit for the murder of a wealthy businessman, and Eddie having to clear Roger's name, mostly because the police department,  headed by Chief Bogus, refuses to do so.  There's also  a subplot involving  a contract that the weaselly Pete, who is Roger's manager  as well as something of a stalker, wants   Roger to sign which would greatly diminish  Roger's  livelihood. This presents a moral  quandary for Eddie,  who, at first, needs Pete's help  to  get information  from some  of the  Toon  residents of  Hollywood. Eddie  also   has an ongoing conflict with the weasel that   affects the plot as well, although not in any meaningful  way.\n\nThe  animation  itself needs to be seen to  be  believed, and there are some laugh-out-loud moments, mostly  provided by the supporting cartoon characters like Donald Duck and Daffy Duck (not the \"duck\"   in question, however).

    "Without question, \"Sherlock  Holmes: A Game of Shadows\" boasts some  of the most  exhilarating action sequences in any Sherlock Holmes film to  date. By  playing against type in a largely dialogue-free sequence at the  film's onset, the  always-reliable Robert Downey Jr. demonstrates the sheer physicality  of the character, while also allowing the story  to thereafter unfold with a delightful quickness.  \n\nThe story   picks up  where the first film left  off,  with  Holmes and his trusted companion, Dr. John Watson, in pursuit of the nefarious Lord Henry Blackwood. Blackwood is suspected   of committing a series of brutal murders in what appears  to be a dark homage to an earlier, more  brutal era of British history.  Of course, nothing  is as it seems,  and  our heroes once again  find themselves up against a vast conspiracy that threatens  not just  their lives, but those of  all of Britain. \n\nDowney Jr. and Jude Law are  again in top form here, and their  chemistry is the   film's greatest asset. Despite a runtime nearly fifteen minutes longer than its  predecessor, the film never  drags,  as a function of a fast-paced  plot and rapid-fire  dialogue. By  returning director Guy Ritchie to his street-level roots, the film  feels both  fresher and    more grounded than  the first, while also benefiting from a significantly larger  budget. \n\nThe true star of the  show is Jared Harris, who manages to  make the villainous Blackwood one of the most compelling characters  in any recent action franchise. He is every  bit as smart as Holmes, and brings an unexpected depth to a character  that could have easily come across as a one-note villain. The scenes  between Harris  and Downey Jr. are  electrifying, and easily  the best sequences in the film.  \n\nThe supporting performances are also strong, with  Stephen  Fry memorable as Holmes's older brother, Mycroft. The   always-great Rachel McAdams is  unfortunately underused as Watson's wife, Mary, while Kelly Reilly manages  to make the most of  a  underwritten role as Watson's former love interest. \n\nThe action sequences are remarkably well-done, with a  delightful mixture  of practical and computer-generated effects. A particular highlight  is a dizzying fight sequence inside a blazing building that feels  as  if it were  lifted straight from the  pages  of  the original Holmes  novels.  \n\nIn  a summer  dominated by  super-heroes and lighthearted fun, \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of  Shadows\" is a  welcome addition to the action genre,  and a strong  successor to the first film.",
    "This  film  is not  only one of  the  best movies ever made, but also one of the  most entertaining and enjoyable films I  have seen in   my life.  The story is  simple enough; Jack  Sparrow (Johnny  Depp)  has been  captured by the Spanish and taken to their island fortress on Tortuga. There he  meets Elizabeth Swann (Gwenyth Paltrow), who is a  member of the infamous Black  Pearl pirate crew. Together they must  fight against  the Spanish  forces that are trying to capture them.  This is a great adventure with some very funny moments. It is a shame that this film  was never released theatrically because it  would be an amazing addition to any collection.\n\nI  am going to give this movie 4 out of 5 stars.",

    "This film is an action-packed, high octane, and  very  entertaining film that  will have  you cheering on your favorite characters as they fight to  save their lives.

They soon find  themselves fighting against a group  of   mercenaries led by a ruthless leader  named Ivan Reitman (Bruce Willis).  This film has some great action scenes with lots of explosions  and  gun fights.

    "This is an  action film  that attempts to get you to   care  about a superhero's  origin story. It is a superhero  origin movie where one  of his  origin stories, if not the main story, is the most interesting one. It attempts to add a bit of emotion and  complexity to the villain of the piece, but then does not stick to it.  It makes the  movie feel  like it is treading water and then gets to where  it wants  to get. It tries to do  too many things at once and ends up not doing  enough of them.\n\nThis is a fun  little  movie but a bit confusing when  you   come to the end for the first  time.",
    "\n\n\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\"  is a gripping, well-acted mystery  that will  keep  audiences guessing until the very end.\n\nMikael Blomkvist  (Michael Nyqvist), a financial  journalist, is convicted of libel after writing a story  that exposes a corrupt Swedish businessman. Needing a break from the public eye,  he  accepts an offer from Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube), the patriarch of the wealthy  Vanger family, to investigate  the decades-old  disappearance of  Henrik's niece, Harriet.\n\nAssisting Blomkvist is Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), a punkish, computer-hacking  loner with  a photographic memory and a dark past. Though she initially comes across  as nothing more  than a necessary  tool, Rapace's performance is so layered and compelling  that Lisbeth  quickly becomes the most interesting character in the  film.\n\nTheooming, atmospheric story is based on  the first book in  the best-selling \"Millennium\" trilogy by  the late Stieg Larsson, and director Niels Arden Oplev (working from  a  script by Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg)  does an admirable job of translating Larsson's  novel to the big screen.\n\nVisually, the  film is stunning, with sweeping shots of the Swedish  countryside and some impressively  gritty urban locations. The music, by  Trent Reznor and  Atticus Ross,   is also very effective,  creating a tense, unsettling feeling  that perfectly  matches the tone of the film.\n\n\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is not for  everyone - the plot is  complex,  the pace is slow, and the film is  rather dark  and depressing.  But  for those who enjoy a  well-written,  well-acted mystery,  this  is a film that should not be  missed.",

    "\"The  Girl with the Dragon  Tattoo\" is a darkly gripping thriller that adroitly straddles the line  between mystery and a deep-dive character study. Based on the  first installment of Stieg Larsson’s Millennium Trilogy, the movie is helmed by  the immensely talented director David Fincher, who never fails to render a chillingly realistic depiction of the narrative.\n\nRooney  Mara's performance  as   Lisbeth Salander is nothing short of a revelation.  She is not only convincingly icy, but also  exudes a certain  level of  vulnerability that is quietly heartrending. The complexity of her character is expertly portrayed, making Lisbeth not just a vigilante  hacker but a layered individual with a very troubling past. Daniel Craig, on the other hand, plays  the dogged journalist  Mikael Blomkvist with appealing gusto  and humility, a  stark contrast  to  his rugged James Bond persona.  The chemistry between Mara  and Craig  adds immensely to the film's dynamic.\n\nMasterful in its  grim atmosphere, the movie utilizes the frigid Swedish landscape not just as a setting,  but essentially  as a central character  that provides a  bleak yet gorgeous backdrop to the chilling tale. Trent    Reznor and Atticus Ross’s sublime score sends  shivers down the spine, casting a spell of   gloom  and exacerbating  the aura of the somber narrative. Jeff Cronenweth’s  cinematography further ensures that the  audience is engaged in the narrative and carries the story through some of its  slow-paced portions.\n\nWhile  highly graphic and  occasionally brutal, \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\"  never feels gratuitous in its violence. Instead, these  scenes help in  underlining the  story's  menacing undertones and Lisbeth's  rage  towards society. The screenplay is praisely taut, ensuring the narrative never loses its focus  and the mystery  engaged with  side-by-side exploration  of its key characters.\n\nIn  conclusion,  \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is a thriller par excellence, armed with   powerful   performances, a deftly woven plot, a brooding atmosphere, and hypnotic musical score. The movie is intense  and confronting,  much like its protagonist, making it a   cinematic  experience that leaves  a  lasting imprint. ",
    "\"Ocean's Thirteen\" is a thrilling  caper that brings back  the charm and charisma of  the original ensemble cast, while adding a fresh twist to  the plot. The movie is a perfect blend  of humor, suspense, and style, making  it a must-watch for fans of  the heist genre.\n\nThe film sees  the return of George Clooney,  Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon,  who once again deliver stellar performances   as  Danny Ocean,  Rusty Ryan,  and Linus Caldwell respectively. Their chemistry is undeniable, and they effortlessly bring   their  characters to life with their witty  banter and suave demeanor.  Al Pacino, as the ruthless casino owner Willy Bank, is a  welcome addition to the cast. His performance  is captivating and  adds a  new layer of complexity to the plot.\n\nThe storyline of \"Ocean's Thirteen\"  is  engaging and well-constructed. The team's plan to  rob Bank's   casino is  intricate and full of unexpected twists and turns, keeping the audience on the edge of their  seats. The film also does a great job of balancing the tension of the heist with moments of humor and camaraderie among the   crew.\n\nVisually, the movie is stunning.  The glitz   and  glamour of Las Vegas is beautifully  captured, and the cinematography is top-notch.  The soundtrack, too, is fitting and adds to the overall mood of the film.\n\nHowever, the movie  is not without  its  flaws. Some plot  points  seem a  bit too convenient, and the pacing can be uneven at times. But these minor  issues do  not detract from  the overall  enjoyment  of  the film.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Ocean's Thirteen\" is a fun and entertaining ride that  successfully recaptures the magic of the original. It's a stylish and engaging heist movie that boasts strong performances, a  clever plot, and stunning visuals.

    "\"Borat: Cultural  Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\" is  a film  that is as audacious as its  title. Sacha Baron  Cohen, the mastermind  behind the character Borat, delivers a performance that  is both hilarious and  cringe-worthy, pushing the boundaries of  comedy and social commentary.\n\nThe film follows Borat, a journalist from Kazakhstan, as   he travels  across America to learn about its culture.  The   genius  of  this film lies in its unscripted interactions with real people, who are unaware that Borat is  a fictional character. This results in some truly outrageous  and unforgettable  moments that will leave you  laughing out loud one  moment and squirming  in your seat the  next.\n\nCohen's portrayal of Borat is nothing short of brilliant. He fully commits to the character, never  breaking character even in the most uncomfortable  situations. His comedic timing is impeccable, and his ability  to improvise  is  truly  impressive. The supporting cast also does a great job,  especially Ken  Davitian, who plays Borat's producer Azamat.\n\nThe film is not for the faint of heart, as it tackles controversial topics and uses shock  humor to  make its points. Some  may find the humor offensive, but it's  important to remember  that the  film is a satire, meant to expose the absurdity and prejudice that exists in society.\n\n\"Borat\" is   a unique film that  is both  a hilarious comedy and a sharp social  commentary.   It's a film that will make you laugh, cringe, and think, often  all at the  same time. It's not a film  for  everyone, but for those who  appreciate its brand  of humor, it's a must-see. ",
    "\"Peaceful Warrior\",  directed by Victor Salva, is an  inspiring story  that beautifully integrates philosophy, spiritual enlightenment, and personal growth. Based on the  novel \"Way of  the Peaceful Warrior\" by  Dan Millman, the  film features  gifted  performances by  Nick Nolte and Scott Mechlowicz that truly engrave the  film's powerful message in the viewer's  heart.\n\nScott Mechlowicz, portraying Dan Millman, delivers a  breakout performance. He perfectly encapsulates the  struggles, growth, and  enlightenment of a competitive athlete seeking  a higher   understanding  of life. As his mysterious mentor 'Socrates,' Nick Nolte  is simply exceptional in his role, imparting wisdom, strength, and subtlety  needed for the character.\n\nThe film's narrative  weaves drama,  emotion, and parable succinctly, making  it an  intensely  moving experience. It touches on the themes of mindfulness,  living in the moment, and  the true   nature of fulfillment:  elements often neglected in mainstream cinema.\n\nCinematographer Sharone Meir captures the essence  of the film through sweeping visual drama  represented  as spiritual transitions of the protagonist. He showcases the depth of  emotions  through visual storytelling as adeptly as  the plot itself develops them. The score by Bennett Salvay is  equally  impressive, adding layers to the film's emotional journey.\n\nThe only criticism that  can  be pointed at the movie is its pacing. It could be a test for viewers who  demand  rapid plot development. However, \"Peaceful Warrior\" isn't a movie about reaching  an end point but about experiencing the journey.\n\nOverall, \"Peaceful Warrior\" is  a  supremely inspiring cinematic experience  and strongly recommended for those seeking answers  to life's deeper questions wrapped up in a dramatic and emotionally charged journey.  The film holds  wisdom, warmth, and  a  certain quiet strength  that stays with you long after the credits roll,  making  it  a gem in  the self-help genre of films.",
    "\"We're the Millers\" is a modern-day comedy film that is far from  being another stereotypical comedy. It surpasses expectations thanks to brilliant performances from its leads and a sharply crafted script.\n\nThe film draws  its charm from  the unique concept of a makeshift family  consisting of a small-time drug dealer, a stripper, a runaway teen, and a clueless neighbor kid.  The idea is fresh, and  director Rawson Marshall Thurber executes it in a way  that feels familiar yet  novel.\n\nJason  Sudeikis, who plays the streetwise drug dealer David  Clark, is the  backbone of the movie. His deadpan humor  and unruffled  demeanor amidst increasingly chaotic situations never fail to provoke laughter. Jennifer  Aniston,    playing stripper Rose,  impressively flexes her comedic chops, imbuing her  character with an unexpected  depth and  vulnerability beneath the hardened exterior. Young actors Emma Roberts and Will Poulter,  as the runaway Casey and the innocent Kenny, respectively, deliver equally commendable  performances, striking  a fine balance between humor and sentimentality.\n\nWhat  bolsters the  film is its perfect blend of comedy and action. The  humor is not  forced, and the comedic timing is impeccable, leading to several  genuine laugh-out-loud moments.  The action sequences are  exciting  and well-choreographed, seamlessly  integrated into the narrative without detracting from the film's  comedic essence.\n\nHowever, at the heart of  “We’re  the Millers” is   a heartwarming story about  an   unconventional family that finds genuine care and connection in each  other amid their wild, law-skirting escapade. Despite their stark differences and  initial  reluctance to bond, the relationships between the characters evolve in a  way that is both believable and touching.\n\nWhile the  movie has its  fair   share of adult humor  and edgy content, it is packaged with enough silliness and  laughs to make these  elements more of an integral  part of the plot rather  than an  attempt at shock value.\n\nIn    conclusion, \"We're the Millers\"  takes  the road-less-traveled in the comedy genre and emerges as a surprisingly  entertaining and heartfelt movie. It delivers consistent laughs  with performances that demonstrate the cast's  stellar comedic timing, all while serving up a slice of sentimentality   to keep viewers emotionally invested. A recommended watch for those who  appreciate a dose   of  irreverent humor alongside  compelling storytelling. ",

The movie is well-acted, well-written, and  well-directed, and  it is a must-see  for anyone who   loves sports movies or is interested in the history of the  Civil Rights Movement.\n\nThe film stars Denzel Washington as  Coach  Herman Boone, a tough  but fair coach who is tasked with  leading the newly  integrated team. Washington gives  a strong and  nuanced performance, bringing  depth  and complexity to a character who could have easily been reduced to a stereotype.    The supporting cast is  also excellent,  with standout performances from Ryan Gosling and Julius Tennon as two of  the team's star  players.\n\nOne of the  things that  sets \"Remember  the Titans\" apart from other sports  movies is its focus on the social and cultural  context in which the story takes place. The film  does not shy away from tackling  the difficult issues of racism  and prejudice, and it provides a powerful  and moving portrayal of  the struggles faced by  the African American  community during this time period. At the same  time, it also celebrates the power of sports to bring people together and transcend racial barriers.\n\nThe football scenes in the movie are exciting and well-choreographed, and they provide  a thrilling  backdrop for the larger story of  the team's  journey towards unity and understanding.

The  film boasts an impressive cast, including Lee Marvin,  Ernest Borgnine, and Charles Bronson, who  deliver solid  performances throughout.\n\nOne of the standout  aspects of the movie is its unapologetic   portrayal of the brutality of  war. The film  does not shy away from graphic    violence and strong language, which adds to its gritty realism. The training montages are particularly intense,  showcasing the raw physicality  and mental  toughness required to carry out  their mission.\n\nThe characters are  well-developed, with each member of the team bringing their  own unique personality and backstory  to  the table. Their camaraderie and chemistry are  palpable, making it easy  to invest in their journey and root for  them as they embark  on their perilous task.\n\nThe film's pacing is well-balanced, oscillating  between moments of  intense action and quieter moments of character   development.

    "I recently watched \"Shrek Forever After\" and was left feeling underwhelmed.  As a fan of the previous Shrek movies, I was excited to see how   the franchise would wrap up  the story of our beloved ogre and his  friends. Unfortunately, this  installment fell flat in several ways.\n\nFirstly, the plot felt tired and unoriginal. The idea of Shrek making a deal  with  Rumpelstiltskin to trade a day from his childhood for  a  day as a real  ogre was interesting enough, but it quickly became predictable and formulaic. The film relied  too heavily on familiar tropes and failed to deliver  any  genuine surprises or twists.\n\nFurthermore, the characters that we've grown to love over the years were reduced to mere caricatures of themselves.  Shrek, Fiona, Donkey,  and Puss in Boots  all seemed like shells of their former selves,  lacking the depth and complexity  that made them so endearing in the  earlier films. Even the usually scene-stealing Antonio   Banderas  couldn't save the  day as Puss in Boots, whose character was reduced  to nothing  more than a glorified cameo.\n\nThe voice  acting,  which has always been a highlight of the series, was  also disappointing. Mike Myers,  Eddie Murphy, and  Cameron Diaz all phoned  in their performances, failing to  bring the same level of energy and enthusiasm that they had  in previous outings. Only Walt Dohrn, who voiced  Rumpelstiltskin, managed to impress, bringing a much-needed injection of humor and personality  to the film.\n\nVisually, the movie was a mixed bag. While some  scenes looked stunning,  with beautiful animation   and vibrant colors, others felt  rushed and poorly rendered.  The 3D effects,  which were clearly added as  an afterthought, detracted   from the  viewing experience rather  than enhancing it.\n\nIn  short, \"Shrek Forever After\" was a disappointing  conclusion   to a beloved franchise. It lacked  the heart, wit, and charm  that made the first three films  so enjoyable,   and  failed to provide a  satisfying  resolution   to",

The  film tells the incredible true story of Indian   athlete Milkha Singh,  who overcomes numerous obstacles to become one of the greatest runners in the  country's history.\n\nThe film's strongest aspect is its captivating storyline, which  is brought to life by a powerhouse performance from Farhan Akhtar. Akhtar embodies the spirit  of Milkha Singh, delivering a  performance   that is both heartfelt and inspiring. His transformation into the character is remarkable,  and he perfectly captures the  emotional highs  and lows of Milkha's journey.\n\nThe supporting cast is  equally impressive, with standout performances from  Sonam Kapoor and Divya Dutta. The  chemistry between the leads is undeniable, and  their relationships add depth and  complexity to the  story.\n\nThe film's cinematography  is  breathtaking, with stunning visuals that transport the viewer to a bygone era. The sweeping shots of India's countryside  and  the  atmospheric music  transport the viewer  to a different time and place,  immersing  them in the story.\n\nThe direction by Rakeysh Omprakash  Mehra  is top-notch,  and he masterfully weaves  together the different  elements of the story to create  a  cohesive and  engaging  film. His attention to detail is impressive, and he doesn't shy away  from exploring the darker aspects of Milkha's life.\n\nThe themes  of perseverance, determination, and hope are woven throughout the film, and they  will  leave you  feeling  inspired and uplifted. \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" is not  just a sports movie, it's a story about the human spirit and its ability to overcome even  the toughest obstacles.\n\nOverall, \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\"  is  a must-see film that will leave you cheering for Milkha and his unwavering spirit.

    "The fifth installment in Disney's Pirates franchise, and it's not as bad as you might think.  It has its flaws but overall it was an enjoyable experience that had    me  laughing out loud at times. Johnny  Depp returns to his  role as Captain Jack Sparrow who finds himself on the run  after being framed by  Salazar  (Javier Bardem), a ghostly  pirate captain seeking revenge against him. He teams up with Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario) and Henry  Turner  (Brenton Thwaites) to find Poseidon's  Trident which  can break the curse placed upon  Salazar and his  crew.\n\nI  enjoyed this film more  than On Stranger Tides because there  were  less  characters  introduced into the  storyline so we could focus more on our main protagonists.  There are some great action sequences  throughout including  one involving a giant squid which was very well done. Javier Bardem gives  a good performance as  Salazar  although he doesn't have much  screen  time compared  to other villains in previous  films such as Davy Jones  or Blackbeard. Geoffrey  Rush  also reprises  his role as Barbossa who  now serves under Governor Swann played  by Orlando Bloom who  makes his return after appearing  briefly during At World's End. Kaya  Scodelario does well playing Carina  Smyth who becomes involved with both Jack & Henry while trying to prove herself worthy enough amongst men despite being  labeled as a witch due to her knowledge about  astronomy/astrology etc.. She gets captured several times throughout but  always manages escape somehow!\n\nOverall  this  wasn't  too  shabby  considering how  long these movies have been going on now - 14 years  since Curse Of The Black  Pearl came out back  then... Still fun though even if parts felt familiar like when they went through town looking for  clues  leading them towards their  destination  just like before except instead of Will Turner  searching for Elizabeth Swan here we got Henry   Turner  doing something similar albeit  slightly different since he didn't know where exactly  she lived unlike Will did way  back when first meeting each other again  after many years apart due to circumstances beyond anyone's  control whatsoever... Anyway  yeah anyway yeah whatever let's move  along shall we?",

    "This  flick is exactly what you expect from a movie   called  The Expendables. All the muscle-bound, aging has-been's  that no one  has heard  from  in years.  (I mean  2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, anybody?) All they need  is  a decent plot and script and someone to get excited, and they'll be back to where they were about  fifteen  years ago.\n\nOkay, so let's  talk about the plot (or lack thereof).\n\nThe Expendables are a group of mercenaries that go into villages  and towns that the bad guys (Arnold and his minions) have run out of  town and  redo the areas to   be \"safe\" again.\n\nThat's pretty much the plot.\n\nThe    team meets up again, and  one of  the members wants them to go on  a  job  for the CIA for some cash. Not a good idea considering   the guy running  the CIA is Stalone. They're going   to go in and take   down a man  that's been running around the country and killing people for the past couple of years without any repercussions, only to discover   at the end of the  movie  that he was  a  victim  of  Stalone before that.\n\nThe job's not going to  be  easy. In fact, the  CIA tells them that they need  to be careful, because they've tried to take the guy down several times.\n\nHow  bad is  it going  to be for the boys? Well,  they're going  up against Stalone, who's running around in a Hummer with three guys who could  have beaten all the Expendable's asses in the  beginning of the  movie without any problem. Let's put it this way: there will be a lot of shooting  with pistols, machine guns, and those little hand  thingys  that put out a  shower of bullets for a  whole second, all done by men  the age of 50. Just for one example, Stallone is shooting a UZI with one hand and holding his arm out without any support. This should be good.\n\nIf  you think that they're going to  be defeated, you are  wrong. There will be a lot of shooting (I'm not  kidding about this). There will  be  a lot ",
    "\"Remember the Titans\" is an inspiring and moving film that tells  the true story  of  a Virginia high school football team  in the 1970s.

    "When   you're  on the   run from  your past, the right  friend can make a   big difference. And when  you're in  prison and your  only escape is to play  a series  of mind  games against one  of the most manipulative beings you'll ever  meet, your friend had  better know how to play the game.\nMike Fratantoni is a gambler. And gambling is his passion. As a   result of his obsession, he had been arrested,  and while behind   bars,  he started a series of games where  he bet on everything that happened around him.\nThe game that Mike and  Nick start is simple. They bet on who's going to fall in love first, how they  will do it  and if  they will   last.  From the start, you see that Nick and Mike will become real friends and that Mike's game is  not the only  thing on his mind. You also see that the two of them, in their own way, are  trying to escape their pasts.\nWhile Mike is trying to  escape by  playing his  game, and  Nick is trying to  escape by falling in love, a series of complications ensues between  the two friends.  They have the same woman (Amanda Peet) that  is in love with one of  them. One of them  makes the other into his best man for his wedding—a wedding which  ends in complete disaster.\nOne  of the  most  interesting aspects of this film, and the one which makes it unique, is not that it  stars Sean Penn (who plays the main character)  and Michael Beach (who plays Dr. Fratantoni), but that   it is actually based on  a true account of a real man who was   playing a game  while in prison. This  story, which is said to be based on  true events  from the life of William Goldman (whose credits  include The Princess Bride and Marathon Man), creates  a complex human drama that could never be found in just a fictional story. If you   take a look beyond all the game theory and the romance that makes this film  enjoyable, you can see a  series  of real life situations that take place between two prisoners   that  will make you reflect on the meaning of the human condition.  It is  a  story of the power of friendship;  of loyalty and of the human weakness that makes us all want to escape  sometimes, even if it's just for  a little   while.\n\"The  Game\" is not a  film about winning. It's about friendship  and winning ",

Shortly after arriving, he discovered that the  division was woefully unprepared for the rigors of  jungle warfare, and that he had  a  full fledged mutiny on his  hands. When his attempts to correct the problems proved  futile, the General took  action, and went straight to Colonel Moore  (Mel Gibson), who was to be in command of a battalion of the Division. Although the Colonel was   a capable officer, he  had doubts about the wisdom of the General's  actions. However, at  the urging of the General,  who told him to be a  \"hammer and show no mercy\", but also to lead his soldiers from the front, the Colonel, whose real name was Joe, accepted  this challenge. Shortly  after, Captain Anderson (Gregory),  the CO of Alpha Company, was reassigned to command Bravo  Company,  and replaced by Captain Harris (Scott Glenn), who did not have much respect for Joe. When the  company began to  complain about the amount of time that they were spending  out in  the  jungle,    Harris took to task a  private, saying that  \"soldiers don't like to  fight\".\nBut not to be undone,  and after  an attempt to reason with him, Joe led 2 platoons of Bravo Company, one of them lead by 2nd  Lt. Upham  (Madeleine Stowe), into an  open  area, where they  began a battle with  the VC. However, it was also from this \"ambush\" that all  of the men  in the company,  save for  2nd  Lt. Upham, received their medals of valor.  That  night, Captain Harris told  Joe that he  should turn  in his resignation, but  Joe said that he was not going to, as it was this platoon  that would be taking  over  Bravo Company. In the  ensuing  battles, several of these soldiers, including 2nd Lt. Upham, died. But then  once more,  the men of Bravo  Company were awarded medals for their actions there. But  even  with all   of its losses, Joe's Company continued on  the  mission at hand, killing countless numbers of VC  in the process.\nCaptain Harris was  replaced  by Captain  Hathcock (Kurtwood Smith), and it was he who was killed in an ambush on Bravo ",

    "The Patidar reservation agitation,  also  known as  the Patidar quota  stir, was a  socio-political  movement that emerged in Gujarat,   India  in the year 2015. It was led by the  Patidar community, also known as the Patels, who  demanded reservation in government jobs and educational institutions.\n\nThe agitation began in July 2015 when  Hardik Patel, a young  Patidar activist, organized a massive rally in Ahmedabad, Gujarat's largest city. The rally  attracted thousands of  Patidars,  who expressed their frustration with the lack of government support and representation  for the  community.  The main demand  of the agitators was to be included in the Other Backward Classes  (OBC) category, which would make them  eligible for  reservation benefits.\n\nThe Patidars have traditionally been an  economically and politically influential community  in Gujarat. However, they have  long  felt marginalized and ignored  by the  state  government  in terms of  representation and access to resources. The agitation highlighted the  community's grievances and their demand  for equal opportunities.\n\nThe  movement   gained widespread attention and support  across Gujarat, with protests, marches, and rallies being held in various  cities and  towns. The agitators utilized social media  platforms to   mobilize  and organize their supporters,  gaining momentum and  visibility.\n\nThe  state government,  initially  caught off   guard  by the scale and intensity of the agitation, initiated talks with the Patidar  leaders  to address their demands. However,  negotiations failed to yield a  resolution, leading to  intensified protests and clashes  between the police  and agitators.\n\nThe agitation  turned violent in August 2015 when clashes erupted between the protesters and the police in  several parts  of the state.

    "Vandwelling is the  practice of living in   a van or   other types of vehicles, often for an extended period of time. While it was traditionally associated with transient or  marginalized populations, in recent  years, vandwelling has gained popularity among  people  from all walks of life seeking a  more minimalist and adventurous  lifestyle.\n\nDescription\nVandwelling involves converting a  van  or RV into  a mobile living space that offers all the basic amenities  required for daily life. This typically includes  a bed, kitchen area with   a small stove  or camping cooker, storage  space, and sometimes even a portable toilet. Some vandwellers choose to customize their vehicles  with additional features like solar panels, built-in showers, or even small wood-burning stoves for heating. The level of comfort  and functionality  varies depending on personal preferences and  the   resources  available to the vandweller.\n\nReasons for Vandwelling\nThere are numerous reasons why individuals choose to  embrace the vandwelling lifestyle. For  some, it offers the  freedom to  travel and  explore the world while still maintaining a  sense of stability and independence. Vandwelling allows  for flexibility in choosing one's  own living environment, with the ability to change  locations frequently or stay in a particular area  for an extended period. This lifestyle is also appealing to those seeking financial independence, as vandwelling can significantly reduce living  expenses such as rent or mortgage payments.\n\nCommunity and Support\nDespite its  relatively niche  appeal, vandwelling has developed a  strong community of like-minded individuals. Online forums,  social media groups,  and  dedicated websites provide platforms for  vandwellers to connect, share  advice and experiences, and  offer support to those new to the lifestyle.  These   communities often organize  meet-ups,  gatherings, and events to foster  a sense of camaraderie among vandwellers and provide  opportunities for networking  and knowledge sharing.\n\nChallenges   and Considerations\nWhile vandwelling offers   numerous  advantages, there  are also challenges and considerations to be  aware of. Vandwellers must navigate local  laws   and regulations regarding parking, overnight stays, and vehicle modifications. Weather conditions can also pose challenges, as  extreme temperatures or inclement   weather can  make living in a vehicle uncomfortable or  even hazardous.  Vandwelling requires careful planning, organization, and adaptability to ensure a safe and sustainable lifestyle.\n\nIn popular  culture,  vandwelling has garnered increased attention through  documentaries, books, and  online influencers documenting their experiences and providing insights into  this alternative way of life. The accessibility of information and  resources has made vandwelling more achievable for those interested  in pursuing a",

    "An orator  in his youth, Marcus (later Emperor) Anicius  Ordenius Florus  was also a prolific orator and  rhetorician  who achieved some fame at Rome prior to his consulship.

After  Caesar's  death  many  important texts were discovered under his  bedside. These included two early treatises on justice entitled Panegyrica and Elegia.

It is  located in the Denderstreek, on the Dender  River,   and is  the capital and largest city  of the Waasland area, which comprises Ronse and the surrounding  municipalities of Sint-Gillis-Waas, Sint-Niklaas, Dendermonde, Wetteren, Hamme, Zele and Lokeren.  The town is sometimes referred  to as  \"the capital of the Waasland\".\n\nRonse is the commercial and   industrial center of the Waasland area, and has a population of 24,072 (1 January 2008). It is home to a number of large companies, including Daikin, the world's largest  air conditioner manufacturer, and Cargill, one of the  world's largest agricultural companies.\n\nThe town has a long and rich history.  It was first mentioned in  839 as Rizza, and was granted  city rights in 1227. The city flourished in the Middle Ages as a  member of the Hanseatic League, and was one of the richest cities in  Flanders. It was  also  an  important  center of the textile industry, and was the birthplace of the Flemish painter Pieter Bruegel  the  Elder.\n\nIn  the 18th  century, the city's economy declined, and it  was occupied by the French in 1708 during  the War of the  Spanish  Succession.  The French returned the city to  the Austrians in 1713, but  it   was conquered by  the French again in  1794 during the French Revolutionary Wars. The  city was annexed  by France   in 1815 at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nAfter  the Belgian Revolution of 1830, the  city became  the capital  of  the newly independent province of East Flanders.  In World  War I, Ronse was occupied by the Germans from 1914 to 1918. The city was severely  damaged by fighting and  heavy shelling, and its historic center was destroyed.\n\nAfter  World War II, Ronse was rebuilt, and has since  regained its status as a major economic center in the Waasland area. The city has a  number of  historic landmarks, including the Church of Our Lady, which dates from the  13th  century, and the  18th-century City  Hall. ",

    "The Patidar reservation  agitation refers to a social-political movement that began in July 2015, led by the Patidar, a  caste  group in the Indian state of  Gujarat. The Patidars,  also  known as the Patels, initiated  the movement to demand  inclusion in the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category, which would make them eligible for  affirmative action benefits under the Indian reservation  system.\n\n=== Background ===\n\nThe Patidar community forms a significant portion of  Gujarat's population. The community is traditionally engaged in  agricultural and business  activities. Over  time, their prosperity had begun to taper due  to economic liberalization, fluctuations in agricultural  income due to unpredictable monsoons,  and increasing competition in the business sector. As a  result,  many Patidars started demanding that they be included in   the OBC category to access reservation benefits in education and government  jobs.\n\nThe agitation was led  primarily by Hardik Patel under  the banner of  the Patidar  Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS). The PAAS  organized multiple rallies, mass demonstrations, and public meetings to mobilize support and raise awareness about the Patidar community's demands. The agitation took  a violent turn  in August 2015,  resulting in the deaths of  several   people, imposition of curfew in many parts of the state, and widespread damage to public and private properties.\n\n===  Government Response ===\n\nThe  Gujarat  government initially  rejected the demands of the Patidars, stating that the current reservation policies were in line  with  the guidelines of the Indian  Constitution and  cannot be altered for    a specific community. The government resorted to police action to control  the agitation, resulting  in  allegations of  police brutality.\n\nLater,  the government took several  initiatives to pacify the agitating Patidars. These included the announcements of schemes  for the economic development of all economically backward classes, irrespective  of their caste. Despite  these efforts, the agitation continued  with the  Patidars  maintaining their demand  for OBC  status.\n\n=== Impact and Continued  Agitation ===\n\nThe Patidar reservation agitation significantly impacted Gujarat's socio-political landscape.  Many public properties were damaged due to  arson and vandalism  during rallies turned violent. The agitation also resulted in  a  perceptible shift in the state’s political equations.  Many Patidar leaders, including  Hardik  Patel,  emerged as significant  figures in the state politics.\n\nAs of 2021, the  demand for the OBC  status by the Patidars  remains unfulfilled and the agitation continues. The  Patidar community's reservation  demand  has sparked a   larger  debate on the Indian reservation  system and its impact on various communities and social groups.",

    "Vandwelling or van dwelling, is the lifestyle of  living  full or  part-time in a vehicle, typically a self-modified van.  This way of life has been adopted  by many individuals around the  world, who choose to abandon the  traditional four-wall home in favor  of  the flexibility and freedom   offered by living in a movable sanctuary  nestled on wheels. \n\nVandwellers, as they call  themselves,   are a  diverse community, consisting of people from all walks of  life. Often, they combine the flexibility of their mobile home with a transient  lifestyle, typically involving traveling,  seasonal  word, or location-independent work.  \n\n==History==\n\nThe concept of Vandwelling isn't a new trend brought  on  by the  minimalist or  the digital nomad movement.  Vandwelling has been a way of  life for many  people for   generations. One of the earliest  notable  instances of  Vandwelling  was during the Great Depression  in the United States, where devastated families lived in their cars,  vans, and makeshift mobile  homes  after losing  their permanent residences. \n\n==Modern Vandwelling Culture==\n\nModern  vandwelling culture has evolved from necessity to an endorsed lifestyle  choice. Today, many Vandwellers do not merely see  their van as a rent-free  alternative but  a  conscious choice for freedom, adventure, and minimalism. Aided by  the  rise of the digital nomadism,  where individuals  can work remotely from anywhere, more people begin to  adopt the   Vandwelling lifestyle. The advent of social media  and platforms like YouTube and Instagram has  created a community where Vandwellers  share their experiences, tips and tricks, and tales from the road and inspire others to take up the lifestyle.\n\n==Van  Modifying and  Setup==\n\nMost of the vans serve as more than just a  sleeping space. They're often converted into fully functional living spaces with  facilities for sleeping, cooking,  storage, and sometimes even bathrooms and showers.  People adapt  their living spaces according  to their needs and the  type of van  they possess. \n\nThe modifications range from simple  setups, involving removable camping  gear and portable  furniture, to   intricate interiors featuring built-in furniture, insulation, solar panels, and custom-made kitchenette or office spaces. \n\n==Challenges and  Legalities==  \n\nHowever, living in  a  van is not always as idyllic and romantic as some may idealize it. Vandwellers often face  challenges including finding a safe and legal place to park  overnight, dealing with extreme weather conditions, maintaining hygiene, and staying connected  to their work or social  ties. Different  countries or cities can have  regulations regarding overnight parking or living in",

    "Andrew Meikle (1766 – 8 April  1818) was a Scottish inventor, mechanical engineer, and manufacturer, widely  regarded  as the \"Father  of the Steam Engine\". He is best known for  his improvements to the Newcomen  atmospheric  engine, which he patented in 1784.  Meikle's inventions and innovations greatly  contributed to the development of the steam  engine, which in turn revolutionized transportation, manufacturing, and mining.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nAndrew Meikle was born   in 1766 in the village of Hamilton, near Lanarkshire, Scotland. He was the son of a blacksmith, and his father's brother was a millwright. Meikle received a basic education at a local  school, but he was largely   self-taught in  mechanics and engineering. As a child, he was fascinated  by machinery and  spent much  of  his  free time tinkering  with engines and gears.\n\nInvention of the  improved  Newcomen  engine\n\nIn 1784, Meikle patented an improved version of the Newcomen atmospheric engine, which had been invented a decade earlier. The Newcomen engine  was a type of steam engine  that used  a  piston to  convert steam pressure  into mechanical work. However,  it had several limitations,  including  the fact that it could   only be used  to pump  water,  and it  was inefficient at converting steam energy into useful work.\n\nMeikle's  improvements to the Newcomen engine addressed these  limitations. He replaced  the piston  with  a  larger, more efficient one, and he  added a condenser to the engine, which allowed the steam to be cooled and condensed more  efficiently. These improvements greatly increased the efficiency  of  the engine,  making it more versatile and useful for a wider range of applications.\n\nImpact on  industry and transportation\n\nMeikle's  improvements  to the Newcomen engine had a profound  impact  on industry and transportation.

    "In 1797 a group led by John and William Fairfax purchased land in what  was  then Cumberland County  (now Adams) for $1 per  acre to establish their own  community.[2]  The town's name came about  when one member suggested that they call it after  his hometown back east; another  said he  would do so if  someone else named theirs as well—and thus  two towns were  born with identical names on  opposite sides of America!

    "In  Christianity, a higher life refers to any Christian experience that goes  beyond what  one might expect in ordinary church membership or attendance.[1] The term was used by Charles Finney  and  others during his time as part of their revivalist  efforts;  it   has also been applied more recently within  Pentecostalism (see Holiness  Movement) where  there    are many different views on how this can be achieved[2]. In some cases these experiences have led people  into new denominations  such those founded around William J Seymour's Azusa Street Revival which began with  black Americans  but  spread throughout North America before World War I  when white  Christians joined them at meetings held outdoors under tents called 'tabernacles'. This  type became known simply because they were often  located  near railroad tracks so trains  could stop nearby while passengers waited for connections elsewhere along its route - hence  our modern word taboo  comes directly outta here too! It all started  back then though not just  among African-Americans either since  whites had already  begun  attending services together long ago even if  only sporadically due mainly  economic reasons rather than religious ones  per  se.\"",

    "\"Bridge music,\"  also  known as \"vugraphy\", is an activity that involves combining musical performance with  visualization software. It was first developed in  2003 by Swedish musician Martin Molin, who sought to create new ways  for  live electronic  musicians to interact with their audiences  while performing on stage.  The term “bridge” comes   from the idea  that it serves as a   bridge between traditional forms of instrumental  and  vocal performances on one hand, and computer-based digital  artwork  created using graphic design programs  like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP on the  other.\n  \nThe process typically begins  with recording individual audio tracks played  through synthesizers, samplers, drum machines or any number of standard  instruments used popularly today within contemporary  dance clubs & festivals   circuits  globally; these  recordings  are   then combined   together into sequences  programmed according to preconceived  arrangements crafted beforehand either solo artist/ groups  alike before going online (uploading them via streaming). These uploaded files serve not only source material enabling performers access but  provide  visual  output displayed projected large scale screens above stages so audience members underneath witness  striking synchronization occurring real time - hence why vugraphies  gained popularity among techno aficionados  worldwide especially those interested modern technology integrating   artful expressions  seamlessly blending electronics  pop culture aesthetics. \n     \nPerformances often involve  complex lighting effects synchronized alongside dramatic changes happening dynamically when different sections play simultaneously creating intricate tapestry soundscape mesmerizing  beholden observers entranced captivation under spellbinding magic happens moments lasting minutes hours  even days continuous unbroken  stretches nonstop ecstasy inducing euphoric  trance never  ceasing rhythmic madness  dancing frenzy movement masses below feeling  spiritual  elevations  reaching heights  previously unimaginable hitherto insurmountables transcendence impossible fathom unfathomed depths plumbed descents darkness   despair stark juxtapositions life death duality existence oblivion revealed unveiled naked  truth stood bare bared all  stripped raw nerve endings exposed tender nerves  laid open   waiting brutal assault merciless beating cruel torment unspeakably painful indescribabl agony inflict unbearble suffering relentless punishment inflicted upon willingly  courted embracing voluntarily submitted submissively succumb surrender meekness humility resignation  docility servanthood humble  obedience  worship adoration reverence devotion sanctimoniousness piety righteousness sinlessness godliness  holiness saintliness sainthood divine grace celestial benevolence heavenly kindness  angelic charity seraphic lenience cherubim affectionateness benignity humaneness angelical benefaction  beatitude paradisial blessedness bliss",
    "A head-on engagement is a military term used to describe a direct confrontation or battle between  two opposing forces. It  typically involves  two  armies  or  groups of soldiers facing each other and engaging in  hand-to-hand  combat or firearms. Head-on engagements  were common during the medieval period  and  the early modern era, when armies would clash in open fields and engage in battles that  could last for hours  or  even days.\n\nOne of the most  famous head-on engagements in  history was the Battle of  Agincourt, fought between  the English and the French in 1415. The English  army, led  by King Henry V, was vastly outnumbered by the French,  but  they used their longbows to great effect, raining arrows down on the French and  causing significant casualties.  When the French finally charged,  the English formed a solid wall of infantry and used their long swords to repel the French attack. The Battle of Agincourt was a decisive  victory for the English and helped establish Henry V as one  of  England's greatest kings.\n\nHead-on engagements continued to  be  used throughout history,  particularly  during World War I  and World War II.   In trench warfare,  soldiers would engage  in direct combat with opposing forces in  a series of  battles that  lasted for months  or even years. The use of machine guns, artillery, and other advanced weaponry made head-on engagements even more deadly, with casualties often numbering in the  thousands.\n\nToday, head-on engagements are  less common,  as modern warfare often involves guerrilla tactics and asymmetric   warfare. However, the  term  is  still used to describe any direct confrontation  between opposing forces, whether it be on a   battlefield or in  other contexts such  as business  or politics.",
