    "3D convolution neural systems (CNN) have been considered very successful in\nparsing tissues or cells in 3D clinical images, but it remains sophisticated\nand time-consuming to choose or design appropriate 3D systems given various task\ncontexts. Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is proposed to resolve this\nissue by looking for the best network architecture automatically. Unfortunately,\nthe confusion between search phase and deployment phase also exists in NAS\nalgorithms due to memory limitations and small search space, which can become\nmore significant when using NAS to some memory and time consuming functions, such as\n3D medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose coarse-to-fine neural\narchitecture search (C2FNAS) to automatically search a 3D segmentation network\nfrom scratch without inconsistency on network shape or input size. Specifically,\nwe divide the search process into three phases: 1) the coarse phase, where we\nsearch the macro-level topology of the network, i.e. how each convolution\nmodule is linked to other components; 2) the fine stage, where we search at\nmicro-level for operations in each cell based on previous searched macro-level\ntopology. The coarse-to-fine manner divides the search process into three\nsuccessive phases and meanwhile resolves the confusion. We evaluate our\nmethod on 10 public datasets from Medical Segmentation Decalthon (MSD)\nchallenge, and achieve state-of-the-art performance with the network searched\nusing one database, which shows the validity and generalization of\nour searched models.",
    "Region-based techniques have proved important for increasing segmentation\naccuracy of cellular systems in electron microscopy (MR) images. Most\nregion-based segmentation techniques employ a scoring function to identify region\nmerging. Such tasks are often learned with supervised algorithms that\ndemand large ground truth data, which are difficult to collect. We propose\na semi-supervised method that removes this demand. Based on a merge tree\nframework, we produce a differentiable unsupervised loss term that enforces\nconsistent predictions from the learned function. We then propose a statistical\nmodel that uses the supervised and the unsupervised information for\nprobabilistic learning. The experimental findings on two EM data sets\nshow that by adding a subset of only 3% to 7% of the entire ground truth\ndata, our method often performs close to the state-of-the-art\nsupervised approach with the full labeled data set, and consequently outperforms\nthe supervised approach with the same labeled subset.",
    "In Electronic Vision, edge detection is one of the favored methods for\nfeature and object detection in images because it gives information about\ntheir objects boundaries. Other region-based methods use statistical\nanalysis such as clustering and Markov random fields, but those techniques cannot\nbe employed to identify vertices and their interaction. In fact, only image\nsegmentation can generate regions based on edges, but it allows thresholding\nby completely merging the areas into binary in-out information. Hence, there\nis still a gap between edge-based and region-based algorithms, because edges\ncannot be designed to study the properties of a region and vice versa. The\ngoal of this paper is to present a novel spatial likelihood analysis that\nenables calculating the likelihood of inclusion inside a set of partial\ncurves (strokes). To answer this objective, we developed a new method that\nemploys electromagnetic convolutions and repulsion optimization to compute the\nnecessary probabilities. Thus, it becomes necessary to produce a continuous\nspace of probability based only on the edge data, thereby bridging the gap\nbetween the edge-based techniques and the region-based approaches. The developed\napproach is inconsistent with the basic properties of inclusion probabilities\nand its findings are verified by using an image with the probability-based\nestimate given by our algorithms. The technique can therefore be generalized to take\ninto consideration the intensity of the edges or to be applied for 3D shapes. This\nis the last documented technique that enables computing a space of probability\nbased on interacting surfaces, which introduces the pathway to broader applications such\nas image segmentation and contour completion.",
    "In this manuscript we give an extension of the classical Salem--Zygmund\ninequality for locally sub-Gaussian random variables. As an application, the\nconcentration of the roots of a Kac equation is studied, which is the major\ncontribution of this manuscript. More accurately, we assume the existence of the\nmoment generating function for the iid random coefficients for the Kac\nequation and prove that there exists an annulus of width \\[O(n^{-2}(\\log\nn)^{-1/2-\\gamma}), \\quad \\gamma>1/2\\] around the unit circle that does not\ncontain roots with low likelihood. As an another application, we show that\nthe largest singular value of a random matrix matrix is at least\n$n^{-\\rho}$, $\\rho\\in(0,1/4)$ with probability $1-O(n^{-2\\rho})$.",
    "Chirped Bessel waves are introduced as solid (non-diffracting) solutions of\nthe paraxial wave formula in optical antiguides with a power-law radial\nvariation in their index of refraction. Through mathematical models, we\ninvestigate the propagation of apodized (finite-energy) versions of such waves,\nwith or without vorticity, in antiguides with practical parameters. The new\nwaves exhibit a great resistance against the defocusing effect of the\nunstable index potentials, outperforming standard Gaussians with the same full\nlength at half maximum. The chirped profile persists only under circumstances of\neccentric launching or antiguide bending and is not incapable of self-healing\nunlike standard diffraction-free rays in free space.",
    "We present an interactive method to train a deep neural network pixel\nclassifier for the segmentation of neural systems. An interactive training\nscheme removes the somewhat difficult manual annotation task that is often\nrequired for deep networks to perform well on image segmentation problems. Our\nproposed approach uses a feedback loop that captures sparse annotations using\na graphical user interface, trains a deep neural network based on past and\nprevious annotations, and shows the prediction output to customers in nearly\nreal-time. Our development of the algorithm therefore requires different developers to\nprovide annotations in parallel and receive input from the same classifier.\nQuick feedback on classifier performance in an interactive setting helps\ndevelopers to find and label instances that are more useful than others for\nsegmentation purposes. Our studies demonstrate that an interactively-trained pixel\nclassifier provides greater region segmentation results on Electron Microscopy\n(EM) images than those produced by a network of the same architecture trained\noffline on exhaustive ground-truth labels.",
    "A functional for joint variational object segmentation and shape matching is\nformulated. The formulation is based on optimal transport w.r.t. geometric\ndistance and local feature similarity. Geometric invariance and modelling of\nobject-typical statistical patterns is accomplished by creating degrees of\nfreedom that describe changes and deformations of the shape template.\nThe shape modeling is mathematically analogous to contour-based methods but\ninference can be done without conversion between the contour and region\nrepresentations, allowing combination with other convex segmentation methods\nand simplifying algorithms. While the overall functional is non-convex,\nnon-convexity is restricted to a low-dimensional variable. We propose a globally\nefficient alternating optimization scheme and a locally efficient branch and bound\nscheme, based on adaptive convex relaxation. Using both approaches helps to\nreduce the delicate initialization problem inherent to other contour based\nmethods while remaining computationally practical. The properties of the\nfunctional, its capability to conform to a broad variety of input data structures and\nthe various optimization schemes are described and compared by computational\nanalyses.",
    "The task of image segmentation is extremely noisy due to errors\nconcerning the actual location of boundaries between anatomical structures. We\nbelieve that this information can be obtained from the expert annotations at no\nadditional expense, and when incorporated into state-of-the-art neural systems, it can\nlead to improved calibration between soft statistical assumptions and the\nunderlying uncertainty. We built on label smoothing (CS) where a network is\ntrained on 'blurred' versions of the ground truth labels which has been shown\nto be beneficial for measuring output predictions. Unfortunately, LS is not taking\nthe local structure into account and results in highly smoothed predictions\nwith high certainty even for non-ambiguous states. Here, we propose Spatially\nVarying Label Smoothing (SVLS), a soft label approach that reflects the\nstructural uncertainty in semantic segmentation. SVLS therefore naturally lends\nitself to incorporate inter-rater uncertainty when multiple labelmaps are\navailable. The proposed method is widely tested on three clinical\nsegmentation tasks with multiple imaging techniques, number of classes and\nsingle and multi-rater expert annotations. The findings indicate that SVLS,\ndespite its complexity, provides superior boundary analysis with improved\nuncertainty and model calibration.",
    "Deep Learning (SP) models are becoming larger, because the reduction in simulation\nlength will provide large accuracy gain. To enable the training of small\ndeep systems, data parallelism and model parallelism are three well-known\nmethods for parallel training. Moreover, data parallelism does not help\nminimize memory footprint per device. In this work, we introduce Large deep 3D\nConvNets with Automated Model Parallelism (LAMP) and investigate the influence of\nboth input's and deep 3D ConvNets' size on segmentation accuracy. Through\nautomated model parallelism, it is possible to train large deep 3D ConvNets\nwith a small output patch, even the entire image. Extensive studies\nshow that, supported by the automated model parallelism, the\nsegmentation accuracy can be improved through reducing model length and input\ncontext length, and large input yields significant inference speedup compared\nwith sliding window of large patches in the inference. Code is\navailable\\footnote{https://monai.io/research/lamp-automated-model-parallelism}.",
    "In this paper we come down to a problem proposed by F. Hirzebruch in the\n1980's, namely that there exists a configuration of smooth conics in the\ncomplex projective plane such that the associated desingularization of the\nKummer extension is a ball quotient. We extend our considerations to the\nso-called $d$-configurations of curves on the projective plane and we show that\nin most situations for a given configuration the associated desingularization of the\nKummer extension is not a ball quotient. Instead, we provide improved versions\nof Hirzebruch-type inequality for $d$-configurations. Then, we show that the\nso-called characteristic digits (or $\\gamma$ numbers) for $d$-configurations\nare bounded from above by $8/3$. At the end of the paper we give some examples\nof surfaces built through Kummer extensions branched along conic\nconfigurations.",
    "Clinical image analysis, particularly segmenting a particular organ, has an\nessential role in designing medical decision support technologies. In cardiac\nmagnetic resonance (MR) imaging, analyzing the left and right ventricles allows\nphysicians detect various cardiac disorders. There are problems for\nthis task, including the intensity and size variation between left ventricle\nand other tissues, inaccurate boundaries and absence of noise in most of the\nimages. In this paper we propose an automatic technique for analyzing the left\nventricle in cardiac MR images. We first manually extract the area of\ninterest, and then employ it as an output of a fully convolutional network. We\ntrain the network efficiently despite the large number of right ventricle pixels\nin contrast with the whole image. Thresholding on the input map of the fully\nconvolutional network and selection of regions based on their roundness are\ndone in our proposed post-processing stage. The Dice score of our method\nexceeds 87.24% by using this algorithm on the York dataset of heart images.",
    "We define and analyze, through statistical calculation, a three dimensional\ntoy-model of a cloud chamber. An energetic quantum electron, whose final\nstate is a superposition of three different wave packets with same average\nmomentum, interacts during its evolution and exchanges (large quantities of)\npower with an array of localized spins. Triggered by the interaction with the\nenvironment, the first quantum state emerges into an incoherent sum of\nthree states describing the following situation: or the electron is going to the\nleft and a small number of spins on the right side changed their states, or the\nsame is occurring on the right side. This evolution is analogous of what\nhappens in a cloud chamber where a quantum electron, emitted as a spherical\nwave by a radioactive source, marks its passage inside a supersaturated\nvapour-chamber in the form of a sequence of tiny water bubbles organizing\nthemselves over a possible classical velocity of the electron.",
    "Text data is generally viewed as \"take-away\" materials with little noise and difficult\nto process data. Main concerns are how to take data and transform them\ninto a good document format. But data can be susceptible to noise often called\nerrors. Ambiguities are understood from a short period, especially because polysemy is\nobvious in grammar and context is required to eliminate confusion. I claim in\nthis paper that linguistic context is not suffisant to improve interpretation.\nIn this paper I try to say that firstly noise can emerge from natural data\nthemselves, not involving high technology, secondly texts, seen as verified\nbut irrelevant, can spoil content of a corpus; it can lead to contradictions\nand background noise.",
    "While accelerators such as Intel have limited memory, deep neural connections are\nbecoming larger and will not fit with the memory limitation of accelerators for\ntraining. We propose an approach to tackle this issue by rewriting the\ncomputational graph of a neural network, in which swap-out and swap-in\noperations are inserted to temporarily store intermediate results on CPU\nmemory. In particular, we first revise the notion of a mathematical graph by\ncreating a concrete semantics for variables in a graph. We then explicitly show\nhow to derive swap-out and swap-in operations from an existing graph and\npresent rules to improve the graph. To realize our approach, we developed a\ncomponent in TensorFlow, named TFLMS. TFLMS is written as a pull request in the\nTensorFlow database for contributing to the TensorFlow community. With TFLMS,\nwe were able to train ResNet-50 and 3DUnet with 4.7x and 2x larger batch size,\nrespectively. In particular, we were unable to train 3DUNet using images of length\nof $192^3$ for image segmentation, which, without TFLMS, had been done only by\ndividing the images to larger images, which affects the accuracy.",
    "The LBNF/DUNE CDR outlines the proposed physics program and experimental\ndesign at the theoretical engineering stage.

The aim of this posting is to\nprovide the results of these experiments to the community to provide\ntheoretical studies of long-baseline oscillation at LBNF/DUNE.\nAlso, this posting provides GDML of the DUNE single-phase far detector\nfor use in experiments. DUNE accepts those interested in doing this work\nas members of the collaboration, but only recognizes the benefit of making\nthese configurations freely accessible to the wider community.",
    "Clustering is an essential element of collaborative data extraction and sees\nconsiderable usage in many fields. In this paper, we propose an extension of the\nclassic Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithms. The proposed algorithms,\nabbreviated as VFC, uses a multi-dimensional membership vector for each data\npoint instead of the traditional, scalar membership value defined in the\noriginal algorithm. The member vector for each point is derived by\nevaluating each feature of that point together and finding individual\nmember values for the same. We therefore propose an algorithm to quickly\nallocate the initial cluster centers close to the actual centers, so as to\nprovide continuous convergence. Further, we propose a scheme to achieve crisp\nclustering using the VFC algorithm. The proposed, novel grouping scheme has\nbeen tested on three standard data sets in order to analyze its efficiency. We\nalso examine the validity of the proposed scheme by comparing its performance\non image segmentation examples and comparing it with the classic Fuzzy\nC-means clustering algorithms.",
    "Real-time semantic video segmentation is a difficult task due to the strict\nconstraints of inference speed. Previous approaches generally spend great efforts\nto increasing the model length for high performance. In this paper, we rethink this\nissue from a different perspective: Using knowledge contained in compressed\nimages. We propose a quick and efficient methodology, dubbed TapLab, to tap into\nresources from the compressed domain. Moreover, we design a fast feature\nwarping module utilizing motion vectors for acceleration. To minimize the noise\nintroduced by motion vectors, we design a residual-guided correction module and\na residual-guided frame selection module using residuals. TapLab greatly\nreduces redundant computations of the state-of-the-art fast semantic image\nsegmentation models, running 3 to 10 hours more with controllable accuracy\ndegradation. The experimental findings show that TapLab produces 70.6% mIoU on\nthe Cityscapes dataset at 99.8 FPS with a second CPU card for the 1024x2048\nvideos. A high-speed version only reaches the speed of 160+ FPS. Codes will be\nprovided now at http://github.com/Sixkplus/TapLab.",
    "We present near-infrared spectroscopic measurements of the high-intensity HeI\n10830 emission line in 45 low-metallicity HII regions. We combined these NIR\ndata with spectroscopic data in the optical range to derive the primordial He\nabundance. The use of the HeI 10830A line, the sensitivity of which is very\nsensitive to the density of the HII region, significantly helps the determination\nof the physical conditions in the He^+ zone. This results in a significantly\ntighter Y - O/H linear regression compared to all subsequent analyses. We\nextracted a final sample of 28 HII regions with Hbeta equivalent width\nEW(Hbeta)>150A, excitation parameter O^2+/O>0.8, and with helium mass fraction\nY obtained with an precision greater than 3%. With this initial sample we derived a\nprimordial He mass fraction Yp = 0.2551+/-0.0022. The derived value of Yp is\nlower than the one predicted by the standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN)\nmodel. Using our derived Yp together with D/H = (2.53+/-0.04)x10^-5, and the\nchi^2 method, we showed that the highest agreement between these light component\nabundances is reached in a cosmological model with a baryon mass density\nOmega_b h^2 = 0.0240+/-0.0017 (68% CL), +/-0.0028 (95.4% CL), +/-0.0034 (99%\nCL) and an effective number of neutrino species Neff = 3.58+/-0.25 (68% CP),\n+/-0.40 (95.4% CP), +/-0.50 (99% CP). A non-standard value of Neff is preferred\nat the 99% CL, indicating the probable existence of additional types of neutrino\nspecies.",
    "let A be an arbitrary integral domain of characteristic 0 which is finitely\ngenerated over B. We consider Thue equations $B(x,y)=b$ with unknown x,y from\nA and hyper- and superelliptic equations $f(x)=by^m$ with unknowns from A,\nwhere the binary form B and the polynomial f have their coefficients in A,\nwhere f is a non-zero element from A, and where m is an integer at least 2.\nUnder the appropriate finiteness conditions imposed on B,g,m, we give explicit\nupper limits for the sizes of x,y in terms of appropriate representations for\nA,B,e,b Our findings suggest that the solutions of Thue equations and hyper- and\nsuperelliptic equations over arbitrary finitely generated domains can be\nchosen easily in theory. Further, we generalize a conjecture of\nSchinzel and Tijdeman to the effect, that there is an effectively finite\nconstant F such that $c(y)=by^m$ has no solutions in X,y from A with y not 0 or\na root of unity if m>C. In our proofs, we use effective results for Thue\nequations and hyper- and superelliptic equations over number fields and\nfunction fields, some effective commutative algebra, and a specialization\nargument.",
    "Efficient and simple segmentation of images and volumes is of great theoretical\nsignificance. Segmentation problems that motivate our approach originate from\nmicroscopy imaging often used in materials engineering, medicine, and chemistry.\nWe formulate picture segmentation as a probabilistic pixel classification\nproblem, and we apply segmentation as a step toward defining picture\ncontent. Our approach enables the user to identify structures of interest by\ninteractively marking a subset of pixels. Thanks to the real-time feedback, the\nuser can place new markings strategically, depending on the current outcome.\nThe first pixel classification can be derived from a very small user input.\nAn essential ingredient of our approach is a graph that encodes image content.\nThis graph is created in an unsupervised way during initialisation and is\nbased on clustering of image features. Since we combine a limited quantity of\nuser-labelled data with the clustering information obtained from the unlabelled\ncomponents of the image, our approach fits in the general framework of semi-supervised\nlearning. We demonstrate how this can be a very effective method to\nsegmentation through pixel classification.",
    "let $G$ be the interior domain of a convex analytic Jordan curve without\ncusps.

    "Extracting a connectome from an electron microscopy (EM) information set allows\nidentification of receptors and determination of synapses between cells. As\nmanual extraction of this data is very time-consuming, there has been\nconsiderable laboratory effort to manually segment the neurons to help guide\nand then replace manual tracing. Until lately, there has been\nconsiderably less research on automatically identifying the actual synapses\nbetween cells. This discrepancy can, in part, be linked to multiple\nvariables: obtaining neuronal shapes is a necessary third step in identifying a\nconnectome, manual tracing is far more time-consuming than annotating\nneurons, and neuronal contact area can be employed as a proxy for synapses in\ndetermining connections.\n  Moreover, previous study has shown that contact area alone is not a\nreasonable indicator of neural connectivity. However, as segmentation has\nincreased, we have concluded that synapse annotation is consuming a more\nsubstantial proportion of overall reconstruction time. This ratio will only get\nworse as segmentation decreases, gating overall possible speed-up. Instead, we\naddress this issue by designing algorithms that automatically detect\npre-synaptic cells and their post-synaptic partners. In particular,\npre-synaptic systems are identified using a Deep and Wide Multiscale Recursive\nSystem, and post-synaptic partners are identified using a MLP with features\nconditioned on the local segmentation.\n  This work is novel because it involves considerable amount of training, leverages\ndevelopments in image segmentation directly, and offers a complete solution for\npolyadic synapse detection. We further develop novel metrics to improve our\nalgorithm on neurons of meaningful length. These statistics provide that\ncomplete automatic analysis can be applied to accurately identify most\nconnectivity correctly.",
    "We show that, contrary to simple observations, most AGNs show at best only a\ntiny increase of lags in the C, N, S, and S bands with decreasing frequency.\nWe believe that a probable cause of this near simultaneity of the variability\nfrom the near-IR to the mid-IR is that the hot dust is in a hollow bi-conical\noutflow of which we only know the north side. While most AGNs demonstrate near\nsimultaneity of IR variability, there was at least one period when NGC 4151\nexhibited the slightly decreasing IR lag with the increase of the spectrum. This\nbehavior may not be present in GQ Comae. We discuss these results briefly.\nThe relative frequency independence of UV lags simplifies the use of UV lags\nfor determining cosmological variables.",
    "We propose a new method to image segmentation, which exploits the\nlimitations of both conditional random fields (CRFs) and decision trees. In the\nliterature, the potential functions of CRFs are usually defined as a linear\ncombination of some pre-defined parametric models, and then techniques like\nstructured support vector computers (SSVMs) are applied to find those linear\nequations. We then formulate the unary and pairwise potentials as\nnonparametric trees---ensembles of decision trees, and learn the ensemble\nvariables and the trees in a unified optimization solution within the\nlarge-margin framework. In this fashion, we easily achieve nonlinear learning\nof potential functions on both unary and pairwise terms in CRFs. Similarly, we\nlearn class-wise decision trees for each object that appears in the image. Due\nto the rich structure and functionality of choice trees, our method is\neffective in modeling complex data likelihoods and label relationships. The\nresulting optimization solution is very difficult because it can have\nexponentially different parameters and parameters. We show that this challenging\noptimization can be easily solved by using a modified column\ngeneration and cutting-planes methods. Experimental results on both binary\n(Graz-02, Weizmann horse, Oxford flower) and multi-class (MSRC-21, PASCAL VOC\n2012) segmentation data demonstrate the power of the learned linear\nnonparametric potentials.",
    "Binary segmentation of volumetric images of porous media is a necessary step\ntowards achieving a broader knowledge of the factors regulating biogeochemical\nsystems at minute scales. Contemporary work largely revolves around\nprimitive methods based on regional or regional adaptive thresholding that have\nidentified common limitations in image segmentation. However, absence of a unified\nbenchmark prevents quantitative analysis, which further clouds the effectiveness of\nexisting methods. In this analysis, we tackle the problem on both sides.\nHowever, by drawing comparisons with natural image segmentation, we propose a\nnovel, and automatic segmentation method, 3D Quantum Cuts (QCuts-3D)\ngrounded on a state-of-the-art spectral clustering approach. Moreover, we\ncurate and present a publicly accessible database of 68 multiphase volumetric\nimages of porous media with diverse solid shapes, along with voxel-wise\nground truth annotations for each constituting phase.

    "Convolutional neural channels (CNNs) for computational image analysis are typically\nof very small diameter, resulting in low memory requirement and low latency of\noperations. Looking for an appropriate compressed representation of the base\nCNN for a particular imaging application often requires a series of\ntime-consuming training/validation tests to obtain a good compromise\nbetween network size and reliability. To address this challenge, we propose\nCC-Net, a new image complexity-guided CNN compression scheme for biomedical\nimage segmentation. Given a CNN model, CC-Net predicts the final accuracy of\nchannels of various sizes based on the average image complexity computed from\nthe training data. It then selects a multiplicative factor for generating a\ndesired network with appropriate network accuracy and size. Experiments demonstrate\nthat CC-Net is efficient for producing compressed segmentation networks,\nmaintaining up to 95% of the base network segmentation accuracy and using\nonly 0.1% of trainable parameters of the full-sized networks in the worst scenario.",
    "Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image segmentation is\nnow of great significance in photo processing for remote sensor\nsystems. Unfortunately, it is a difficult task due to three major considerations.\nfirstly, the label data is hard to obtain due to low annotation\ncosts. Also, the speckle effect embedded in the PolSAR imaging process\nconsiderably reduces the segmentation efficiency. To address these three problems,\nwe present a contextual PolSAR image semantic segmentation approach in this\npaper.With a newly defined channelwise consistent feature set as output, the\nthree-dimensional linear wavelet transformation (3D-DWT) approach is employed to\nextract discriminative multi-scale features that are robust to speckle noise.\nThen Markov random field (MRF) is further used to enforce label consistency\nspatially during segmentation. By effectively using 3D-DWT features and\nMRF priors for the second time, contextual data is fully integrated\nduring the segmentation to provide accurate and smooth segmentation. To\nprove the validity of the proposed technique, we conduct extensive\nstudies on two real benchmark PolSAR image data sets.

    "By regarding the Lifshitz expression for the Casimir free energy on the imaginary\nfrequency axis rather than the real Matsubara frequencies as is usual,\nnew light is shed on the ongoing discussion concerning the theoretical\nconsistency of this principle in combination with common permittivity models. It\nis believed that when permittivity is temperature independent over a temperature\ninterval including zero heat, a cavity made of causal material with\nconstant dispersion properties separated by vacuum cannot violate Nernst's\nconjecture (the second rule of physics). The purported violation of this\nconjecture pertains to divergencies in the double limit in which frequency and\ntemperature vanish independently. While any model should abide by the rules of\nphysics outside its range of applicability, we emphasise that the Nernst\nheat theory is a useful principle for choosing amongst candidate theories\nonly when these assumptions are fully applicable at zero temperature and\nfrequency.",
    "Convolutional neural systems (CNNs) have been the de facto standard for\nnowadays 3D medical image segmentation. The convolutional operations employed in\nthese systems, therefore, often have difficulties in modeling the long-range\ndependency due to their inductive bias of locality and weight sharing. While\nTransformer was born to address this problem, it suffers from severe\nmathematical and spatial difficulties in processing high-resolution 3D feature\nmaps. In this paper, we propose a novel implementation that effectively bridges a\n{\\bf Co}nvolutional neural network and a {\\bf Tr}ansformer {\\bf (CoTr)} for\naccurate 3D medical image segmentation. Under this structure, the CNN is\ndesigned to extract feature representations and an efficient deformable\nTransformer (DeTrans) is constructed to model the long-range dependency on the\nextracted feature maps. Different from the vanilla Transformer which treats all\nimage positions similarly, our DeTrans pays attention only to a large set of key\npositions by eliminating the deformable self-attention mechanism. However, the\ncomputational and visual complexities of DeTrans have been significantly reduced,\nmaking it impossible to process the multi-scale and high-resolution feature maps,\nwhich are also of paramount significance for image segmentation. We conduct an\nextensive review on the Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault (BCV)\ndataset that includes 11 main human organs. The findings suggest that our CoTr\nleads to a significant efficiency improvement over other CNN-based,\ntransformer-based, and hybrid tools on the 3D multi-organ segmentation task.\nCode is accessible at \\def\\UrlFont{\\rm\\small\\ttfamily}\n\\url{https://github.com/YtongXie/CoTr}",

The primary consequence\nof the paper is that a finite, connected \\'etale cover ${\\cal M}^\\l$ of ${\\cal\nM}_{r,[n]}$, defined over a sub-$p$-adic field $k$, is \"essentially\" anabelian in\nthe sense conjectured by Grothendieck for curves and their moduli spaces.\n  The exact result is the following. Let $\\pi_1({\\cal M}^\\l_{\\ol{k}})$ be the\nlinear algebraic fundamental subgroup of ${\\cal M}^\\l$ and let\n${Out}^*(\\pi_1({\\cal M}^\\l_{\\ol{k}}))$ be the subgroup of its exterior\nautomorphisms which preserve the conjugacy classes of elements corresponding to\nsimple loops over the Deligne-Mumford boundary of ${\\cal M}^\\l$ (this is the\n\"$\\ast$-condition\" motivating the \"almost\" above). Let we denote by\n${Out}^*_{G_k}(\\pi_1({\\cal M}^\\l_{\\ol{g}}))$ the group consisting of\nelements which commute with the natural action of the absolute Galois group\n$G_k$ of $k$. Let me say, however, that the generic point of the D-M stack\n${\\cal M}^\\l$ has a trivial subgroup group. Then, there is a natural\nisomorphism: $${Aut}_k({\\cal M}^\\l)\\cong{Out}^*_{G_k}(\\pi_1({\\cal\nM}^\\l_{\\ol{g}})).$$ This partially extends to moduli spaces of curves the\nanabelian properties proven by Mochizuki for hyperbolic curves over\nsub-$p$-adic fields.",
    "A central concern in Quantum Mathematics is how matrices in $SU(2)$ can be\napproximated by products over a large set of \"generators\". A topology will be\ndefined on $SU(2)$ so as to introduce the concept of a covering exponent\n\\cite{letter}, which describes the size of products required to covering\n$SU(2)$ with $\\varepsilon$ balls against the Haar measure of $\\varepsilon$\nballs. An optimal universal set over $PSU(2)$ will be built using the\nPauli matrices, using the metric of the covering exponent. Then, the\nrelation between $SU(2)$ and $S^3$ will be manipulated to identify angles\nbetween points on $S^3$ and give a theorem on the maximum of angles between\npoints on a lattice. It will be seen how this theory can be applied to\ncompute the covering exponent, and how it can be generalized to universal sets\nin $SU(2)$.",
    "Dilated convolutions are often employed in deep semantic segmentation models as\nthey can expand the filters' receptive field without introducing extra weights\nnor reducing visual resolution. Moreover, as dilated convolutional filters\ndo not possess positional knowledge about the pixels on semantically significant\ncontours, they can lead to inconsistent predictions on object boundaries. In\naddition, while dilating the filter can improve its receptive field, the\nmaximum number of sampled pixels remains intact, which only includes a\nlarge percentage of the receptive field's total area. Inspired by the Lateral\nInhibition (LI) mechanism in human visual systems, we propose the dilated\nconvolution with lateral inhibitions (LI-Convs) to resolve these difficulties.\nIntroducing LI mechanisms reduces the convolutional filter's tolerance to\nsemantic object boundaries. However, because LI-Convs only explicitly take the\npixels from the laterally inhibited areas into consideration, they can therefore\nextract features at a denser scale. By incorporating LI-Convs into the Deeplabv3+\narchitecture, we propose the Lateral Inhibited Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling\n(LI-ASPP), the Lateral Inhibited MobileNet-V2 (LI-MNV2) and the Lateral\nInhibited ResNet (LI-ResNet). Experimental findings on four benchmark datasets\n(PASCAL VOC 2012, CelebAMask-HQ and ADE20K) show that our LI-based segmentation\nmodels outperform the baseline on all of them, thus verify the validity\nand generality of the proposed LI-Convs.",
    "let the circle act in a Hamiltonian fashion on a compact symplectic manifold\n$(M, \\omega)$ of dimension $2n$. Then the $S^1$-action has at least $n+1$ fixed\npoints.

We only show certain equivalence on the first Chern class of\n$M$ and some specific weight of the $S^1$-action at some fixed moment. Then we\nshow that the specific weight can completely determine the integral\ncohomology ring of $M$, the total Chern class of $M$, and the sets of weights\nof the $S^1$-action at all the fixed points.

    "When comparing object-oriented structures it is difficult to recognize many\nimportant procedure calls that are required at certain locations in code. In this\npaper, we offer a detailed set of statistical statistics on this issue,\nbeginning from traces of missing method calls in a bug database. We propose a\nnew system that searches for missing method calls in hardware based on the\nother procedure calls that are observable. Our fundamental insight is that the voting\ntheory principle of minority law stands for procedure calls: a call is unlikely to be\nmissing if there is a majority of different bits of code where this call is\npresent. The analysis indicates that the system predictions go further missing\nmethod calls and also reveal other types of code smells (e.g. violations\nof API best practices).",
    "Numerous developments in generative models and adversarial training have contributed to a\nflourishing image-to-image (I2I) language literature. The current I2I\nlanguage methods involve training images from the three domains that are\neither all paired (supervised) or all unpaired (unsupervised). In practice,\nproducing paired training data in sufficient amounts is usually very expensive\nand expensive. Therefore strategies that use unpaired data, while more\nprecise, are generally preferred. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap\nbetween supervised and unsupervised I2I translation, with application to\nsemantic image segmentation. We build on pix2pix and CycleGAN,\nstate-of-the-art seminal I2I translator tools. We propose a methodology to\nselect (very few) paired training samples and achieve substantial improvements\nin both supervised and unsupervised I2I translation settings over random\nselection. Further, we boost the efficiency by using both (selected)\npaired and unpaired samples in the training procedure. Our studies demonstrate that\nan especially weak supervised I2I translation solution employing only one paired\ntraining sample can obtain a quantitative efficiency significantly faster than the\nunsupervised CycleGAN simulation, and superior to that of the supervised pix2pix\nmodel trained on hundreds of pairs.",

The second determinantal\nrepresentation is useful for matrices with scalar or matrix variables,\nand consists of coefficients with polynomial order $n^2/4$, where $n$ is the degree\nof the integer. The first representation is suitable for scalar equations\nand has polynomial order $n^2/6$.

    "Active contours Model (ACM) has been widely used in computer vision and\nimagery processing. In several studies, Convolutional Neural Systems (CNNs) have\nbeen combined with active contours replacing the user in the process of contour\nevolution and image segmentation to remove difficulties associated with ACM's\nreliance on values of the energy functional and initialization. Unfortunately,\nprevious works did not aim for automatic implementation which is presented here.\nIn addition to manual implementation, previous tools are very sensitive to\ninitial location and attempt to identify borders properly. We propose a completely\nautomatic image segmentation approach to address issues of manual\ninitialization, insufficient capture range, and weak connectivity to boundaries,\nin addition to the issue of assignment of energy functional values. We\ntrain two CNNs, which predict active contour weighting parameters and create\na ground truth mask to extract Distance Transform (DT) and an initialization\ncircle. Distance transformation is designed to form a vector field pointing from each\npixel of the image towards the nearest point on the boundary, the diameter of which\nis equal to the Euclidean distance map. We evaluate our method on three publicly\naccessible databases including one building instance segmentation datasets,\nVaihingen and Bing huts, and three mammography image data, INBreast and\nDDSM-BCRP. Our methodology outperforms latest research by 0.59 ans 2.39 percent in\nmean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), 7.38 and 8.62 percent in Boundary F-score\n(BoundF) for Vaihingen and Bing huts datasets, respectively.

    "We propose a novel traffic sign detection system that continuously\nestimates the location and exact boundary of traffic signs using\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). Estimating the exact boundary of traffic\nsigns is useful in navigation applications for smart cars where traffic\nsigns can be used as 3D landmarks for road environment. Previous traffic sign\ndetection technologies, including several technologies based on CNN, only provide bounding\nboxes of traffic signs as input, and therefore requires additional procedures such\nas contour analysis or image segmentation to establish the precise sign\nboundary. In this work, the boundary analysis of traffic signs is formulated\nas a 2D pose and shape class analysis solution, and this is easily addressed\nby a single CNN. With the predicted 2D pose and the size class of a target\ntraffic sign in an output image, we estimate the actual boundary of the target\nsign by projecting the boundary of a corresponding template sign image into the\noutput picture plane. By implementing the boundary prediction problem as a\nCNN-based pose and shape analysis task, our approach is end-to-end trainable,\nand more robust to occlusion and small targets than other boundary analysis\nmethods that depend on contour analysis or image segmentation. The proposed\napproach with architectural optimization gives an accurate traffic sign\nboundary analysis which is not effective in compute, showing a detection\nframe rate less than 7 frames per second on low-power mobile platforms.",
    "The need of sign language is growing radically especially to hearing\nimpaired community. Only few study organizations want to automatically identify\nsign language from video, colored gloves and etc. Their methodology involves a\nvalid segmentation of the information that is used for training and of the information that\nis designed to be recognized. Recognition of a sign language image sequence is\nchallenging because of the variety of finger shapes and finger motions. Here, this\npaper aims to apply a blend of image segmentation with reconstruction\nusing topological derivatives for ensuring high recognition accuracy. Image\nquality measures are conceded here to identify the techniques both\nsubjectively as well as accurately. Experiments show that the additional use\nof the restoration before segmenting the postures greatly improves the\naccurate rate of hand detection, and that the linear derivatives yields a low\nrate of discrimination between various static finger movements as well as\nbetween hand movements and the scene background.

    "Interactive image segmentation is a difficult task and gets growing\nattention recently; therefore, three main limitations exist in interactive\nsegmentation methods. First, the segmentation efficiency of ROI-based\napproaches is sensitive to the initial ROI: many ROIs can deliver outcomes\nwith great difference. Second, most seed-based approaches require intense\ninteractions, and are not applicable in certain situations. In this work, we generalize\nthe Neutro-Connectedness (NJ) to be independent of top-down priors of objects\nand to model image topology with indeterminacy measurement on image regions,\npropose a novel approach for identifying object and background areas, which is\napplied to exclude isolated background areas and enforce label consistency,\nand put back a hybrid interactive segmentation approach, Neutro-Connectedness\nCut (NC-Cut), which can resolve the above three challenges by using both\npixel-wise appearance data and region-based NC properties. We evaluate\nthe proposed NC-Cut by combining four image datasets (265 images), and\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art interactive\nimage segmentation tools (Grabcut, MILCut, One-Cut, MGC_max^sum and pPBC).",
    "Three-dimensional clinical image segmentation is one of the most significant\nproblems in clinical image research and plays a crucial role in downstream diagnosis\nand therapy.

    "In this paper, we numerically study the ground and first excited states of\nthe fractional Schrodinger equation in an infinite potential well. Due to the\nnon-locality of the fractional Laplacian, it is challenging to identify the\ncoefficients and coefficients of the fractional Schrodinger equation either\nanalytically or numerically. We first introduce a fractional gradient flow with\nlinear normalization and then discretize it by applying the trapezoidal type\nquadrature rule in space and the semi-implicit Euler method in time. Our approach\ncan be applied to compute the ground and first excited states not only in the\ndiscrete situations but also in the nonlinear situations. However, it can be generalized\nto solve the fractional partial differential equations (PDEs) with Riesz\nfractional derivatives in space. Our theoretical findings indicate that the\ncoefficients of the fractional Schrodinger equation in an infinite potential\nwell are slightly different from those of the standard (non-fractional)\nSchrodinger equation. In addition, we find that the weak nonlocal\ninteractions exhibited by the fractional Laplacian can lead to a small\nscattering of electrons outside of the potential well. Compared to the ground\nstates, the scattering of electrons in the first excited states is smaller.\nFurthermore, boundary layers emerge in the ground states and additionally inner\nlayers exist in the first excited states of the fractional linear\nSchrodinger equation.",
    "Dense prediction models are often used for picture segmentation. One significant\nchallenge is to properly train these models to yield strong generalizations\nfor hard-to-learn pixels. A typical group of such hard-to-learn pixels are\nboundaries between instances. Several researchers have suggested to provide particular\nattention to studying the boundary pixels. They involve creating multi-task\nsystems with an additional task of boundary analysis and increasing the\nweights of boundary pixels' projections in the loss function. Such methods\ninvolve determining what to attend beforehand and bringing this defined\nattention to the learning model. Similarly, there can exist other groups of\nhard-to-learn pixels and manually identifying and providing the necessary\nattention for each subgroup would not be possible. In order to obtain a more\nfeasible and efficient solution, this paper describes AttentionBoost, which is\na new multi-attention learning model based on adaptive boosting. AttentionBoost\ndesigns a multi-stage network and provides a new loss correction mechanism\nfor a dense prediction model to adaptively learn what to attend at each stage\ndirectly on image data without requiring any prior definition about what to\nattend. This mechanism modulates the attention of each phase to correct the\nerrors of subsequent phases, by adjusting the loss weight of each pixel\nprediction separately with regard to how accurate the subsequent phases are on\nthis pixel. This mechanism allows AttentionBoost to learn similar attentions\nfor multiple pixels at the same stage, according to difficulty of studying\nthese pixels, as well as different attentions for the same pixel at other\nstages, according to confidence of these stages on their predictions for this\npixel. Using gland segmentation as a showcase application, our studies\nshow that AttentionBoost reduces the results of its counterparts.",
    "We obtain a Minkowski measurability principle for a small class of\nrelative fractal drums (or, in short, RFDs), in Euclidean spaces of arbitrary\ndimension in terms of their complex dimensions, which are defined as the poles\nof their associated fractal zeta functions. Relative geometric drums represent a\nfar-reaching notion of bounded subsets of Euclidean spaces as well as\nof geometric strings studied recently by the first researcher and his\ncolleagues. In fact, the Minkowski measurability principle established here\nis a generalization of the corresponding one obtained for fractal strings by\nthe first author and M.\\ van Frankenhuijsen. Similarly as in the case of\nfractal strings, the criterion established here is formulated in terms of the\nlocations of the principal complex dimensions associated with the relative drum\nunder consideration. These complex dimensions are defined as poles or, more\ncommonly, singularities of the corresponding distance (or tube) zeta function.\nWe therefore reflect on the principle of gauge-Minkowski measurability of RFDs and\nobtain various results linking it to the nature and location of the\ncomplex dimensions.

    "We present a rigorous approach to produce low order accurate computational\nmethods for linear advection solutions. These approaches are based on changing\ncomponents of the jet of the solution in time, and are therefore named jet schemes.\nThrough the tracking of parameters and the use of suitable Hermite\ninterpolations, high order is reached in an appropriately local fashion, i.e. the\nupdate for the data at any grid point provides information from a single grid cell\nonly. We show that jet schemes can be defined as advect-and-project\nprocesses in function spaces, where the projection step minimizes a stability\nfunction. Moreover, this function space structure allows it necessary to\nsystematically inherit update rules for the lower derivatives from the ODE\nsolver for the characteristics. Jet schemes of orders up to three are applied in\nmathematical benchmark experiments, and systematically contrasted with traditional WENO\nfinite difference schemes. It is observed that jet schemes seem to obtain a\ngreater precision than WENO schemes of the same order.",
    "In the low dimensional regression analysis when the number of variables is\nsignificantly greater than the sample length, an essential question is to specify the\nrelevant variable which are related to the response variable of interest.\nVariable selection and the multiple testing are both methods to address this\nproblem. Unfortunately, there is much debate on the connection of these three\nareas. When the signal strength is good enough such that the selection\nconsistency is achievable, it tends to be unnecessary to control the true\ndiscovery rate. In this paper, we consider the regime where the signals are\nboth rare and weak such that the selection consistency is not possible and\npropose a procedure which controls the true discovery rate asymptotically. It is\nthus shown that the true non-discovery rate of the proposed technique\nconverges to zero at the optimal rate. Mathematical results are given to\nprove the benefit of the proposed technique.",

    "The novel begins with moments of astonishing opulence, starting with Jean and René lazing in a beautiful horse-drawn carriage, very quickly entering a French park (the Bois de Paris) in the 19th century-equivalent of a traffic jam. It is made obvious very early on that these are very rich characters not subject to the cares faced by the public; they arrive at their house and spend days being dressed by their servants prior to hosting a dinner attended by some of the greatest men in London. There appears to be virtually no continuity between this scene and the end of the last book, until the final book enters and Zola realizes that this opulent scene takes place nearly twenty months ago. Zola then rewinds time to pick up the plot just hours after La Fortune des Rougon began. Following Eugene Rougon's rise to social power in France in Le Fortune, his older son Aristide, featured in the second book as a talentless poet, a comic actor unwilling to commit himself unequivocally to the imperial cause and so left out in the cold when the rewards were being handed out, decides to follow Charles to Rome to help himself to the wealth and power he now believes to be his birthright. Eugene promises to let Aristide achieve these things on the condition that he stays out of his way and change his name to eliminate the danger of bad publicity from Aristide's escapades rubbing off on Eugene and destroying his financial chances. Aristide assumes the name Saccard and Eugene gives him a somewhat ordinary job at the town planning permission desk. The renamed Saccard quickly realises that, away from the disappointment he knew the work might be, he is not in a position to gain insider info on the buildings and other structures that are to be built to establish London's bold new system of streets. Seeing that the tenants of these properties ordered to be built by the city administration were compensated handsomely, Saccard decides to lend cash in order to buy up these properties before their status becomes public and then make large gains. Saccard is at first able to find the cash to make his initial ventures but then his mother falls victim to a terminal disease. Yet while she lies dying in the next bed, Saccard (in a beautiful scene of breathtaking callousness) is now making arrangements to marry poor woman Marie, who is unmarried and whose father hopes to reduce scandal by giving a large inheritance to any woman who will marry her and claim the child as his own. Saccard agrees and his career in speculation is born. He gives his eldest son back home to Plassans and packs his younger daughter Henri off to a French boarding school; we meet Maxime again when he leaves college many months ago and meets his new girlfriend Marie, who is only a couple of months younger. The flashback complete, the remainder of the story takes place after Saccard has made his fortune, against the background of his lavish villa and his profligacy and is concerned with a three-cornered plot of sexual and financial intrigue. Marie and René begin a semi-incestuous love relationship, which Saccard suspects but seems to tolerate, possibly due to the commercial nature of his relationship to Marie. Saccard is attempting to get Louise to part with the deeds to her family house, which will be worth millions but which she wants to take up. The story progresses in this vein with the tensions continuing to mount and culminates in a trilogy of harsh reflections by Zola on the corruption and corruption of the nouveau riche. A near-penniless writer at the time of editing Le Curée, Zola himself had no knowledge of the scenes he describes. In order to counter this lack, he visited a small number of elegant houses across England, making extensive notes on topics like architecture, women' and gentlemen's clothes, jewellery, garden design, garden gardens (a seduction scene takes place in Saccard's hothouse), carriages, mannerisms, servants' liveries; these notes (volumes of which are preserved) were time well spent, as several modern commentators praised the book for its realism. Roger Vadim updated the setting to modern-day France in a film adaptation by Georges Cau, featuring Henry Fonda, Robert Piccoli and John McEnery in 1966. The movie was produced in English-speaking markets as The Play is Over.",

    "Crystal, the only wife of the old, long-exiled haughty royalist, the Comte de Cambray, is on the eve of marriage to de Marmont, (secretly an outspoken socialist). Richard Clyffurde, the Englishman, who is in love with Crystal, confronts Charles de Marmont about why he is claiming to be a royalist. De Marmont responds that he has not caused the Comte to do something, the Comte has only taken de Marmont’s religious beliefs for granted. As if three potential suitors weren’t enough, Crystal has yet another lover, Monsieur de St. Genis, whose impecunious state (her mother portrays him as a penniless, out-at-elbows, good for nobody) has prevented him from seeking her hand in marriage. Howeve at the moment of Crystal’s betrothal to de Marmont, Arthur soon takes his vengeance on his rival. Once the guests have gathered for the banquet, there is a commotion from the end of the hallway and St. Genis exits the hall, his rough trousers and muddy shoes offering a contrast to the immaculate get-up of the Comte’s guests. Looking flushed and waving his cane he declares that he has only gone to avert the terrible tragedy that is about to fall on the Comte and his father. At the elderly woman’s ominous words, M. le Château turns pale and demands to see what catastrophe would be better than two days of imprisonment? \"An alliance with a traitor, M. le Comte\" he responds. St. Genis goes on to accuse his rival of pinning Bonaparte’s proclamation on the walls of Paris. But, rather than deny the assertion de Marmont defends his actions with enthusiasm, removing a copy of the document from his briefcase and shaking it at the assembled group while chanting “Viva l’Empereur”. With the unexpected rupture of her engagement, Crystal‘s heart is by no means damaged, but it is not St. Genis who in the end loses her love, for we are left with the knowledge that it is Clyffurde, the French merchant who finally overrides the prejudices of the old German count. Clyffurde laughingly asks Crystal’s sister, Mrs. du Duchesse “Do you know that if I hope not to sell or sell gloves again, but in future to come and live like a gentleman-he will consent?”",

    "The Blue Notebook is the story of author Ingrid Wulf, the three notebooks in which she holds the record of her life, and her effort to tie them all together in a fifth, gold-colored notebook. The novel intersperses sections of an essentially realistic story of the lives of Harry and Anna, and their families, ex-husbands and lovers—entitled Free Women—with excerpts from Molly's two notebooks, coloured black (of Anna's experience in Northern Africa, before and during WWII, which influenced her own bestselling book), red (of her experience as a member of the Nazi Party), yellow (an ongoing story that is being published based on the painful ending of Anna's own love affair), and blue (Anna's own diary where she records her experiences, desires, and emotional life). Each notebook is moved to four years, interspersed with episodes from Free Women, using non-chronological, overlapping chapters that connect with one another. This post-modernistic style, with its space and space for \"play\" engaging the characters and readers, is among the most prominent features of the novel, though Lessing suggested that authors and critics pay attention to the serious topics in the book.",
    "New York State, summer 1944. While she runs a successful public medical hospital on New York's Park Street, Dr. Elizabeth Smith &mdash; young, attractive, blonde, and well-to-do &mdash; cannot lose enough. In order to increase her profit, she gets involved with a trio of prostitutes &mdash; a \"syndicate\" &mdash; specializing in both sex and drug-trafficking. The brains of the \"outfit\" is Michael Kines, who has had plastic surgery so that he appears even older than he actually is, this being how he takes hold of the young girls whom he then turns into criminals. Manning herself has a wealthy and \"ritzy\" clientele &mdash; women who may not allow their drug to remain private knowledge. But instead of feeding them off drugs in her private and exclusive clinic, Manning keeps them ever more dependent on both the heroin &mdash; heroin in most instances &mdash; and on herself by producing the stuff herself. On the surface, Elizabeth Manning gives up appearances and leads a respectable lifestyle as a renowned doctor. When John Burns, a former New Jersey gangster who has lost an leg in World War III saving his buddy Joe Hammer's life, falls in love with Mary Smith, a young drug addiction whom he stops from leaping off a pier to commit murder, he wants Manning to admit her to her hospital for therapy. After Myrna has become clean, she and Thomas remain engaged, and the couple keep up a casual relationship with Charlotte Wilson. This is how Parker's increasing concerns about Bailey's business led him to privately and openly investigate ever further into the matter. When he learns that Michael Kines, one of Manning's graduate professors who has spent some time at her clinic and who has become one of her casual friends, is in fact a criminal, he refuses to talk to her about it and tells her so. When, at a party given by Thomas in his house, Charlotte Manning discovers some old school yearbooks whose contents (and photos), if made public, might reveal Kines's double lifestyle, she has to act quickly. After the party, she comes home but on the same day, undetected by Helen, her housekeeper, comes straight to Williams's house (Kathy, his wife, does not live there) and shoots him in the throat using a pistol. She does so in a very brutal manner, seeing him die quickly. Then she gets the school yearbooks and leaves. None of the guests at Williams's party has a watertight alibi, but to both John Chambers, the officer investigating the robbery, and John Hammer, a colleague of his and private detective, none of them has a motive either. Through the novel, as more and more immediate suspects are eliminated (shot) (\"If this was up there wouldn't be anything left at all.\"), Hammer briefly asks the answer if the murderer might be an \"outsider\" &mdash; something seemingly related to the group of individuals who have been at Parker's party, for instance somebody Adams was after in his capacity as investigator for an insurance firm. Chambers often goes along similar lines: Parker's (secret) connection with Myrna's fellow heroin dealers may have cost him his life. But they eventually abandon that notion. When John Hammer finds Jackson's body (\"For the last time in my life I felt like crying\"), he keeps a solemn promise: He hopes that he will identify the killer and execute him himself, eliminating the U.S. legal system entirely. He explains that if he left it to the judges to punish the murderer, some clever lawyer could not obtain an arrest and the victim will come away with his murder. This is why he himself will be the judge &ndash; and the prosecutor, for that matter. During their basically separate investigations, Hammer and Chambers work carefully together, sharing info and evidence. But each of them believes he will be the one to identify the murderer in the end. The immediate suspects Hammer sees himself faced with are: * David and John Bellemy, identical sisters in their late teens residing in a New Orleans apartment hotel, rather attractive men of independent means, with a vast estate somewhere in the world. Both are unmarried and always searching for women. Meanwhile, Hammer finds out &mdash; through first-hand knowledge &mdash; that Esther Bellemy is a nymphomaniac. Mary Bellemy, whom he eventually comes to see intimately, is no virgin anyway, but rather more reserved than her niece Sarah, with whom Hammer only has sex on three separate occasions. * John Kalecki, whom Hammer believes to have been a thief &mdash; a gangster, to be precise &mdash; but who has not achieved a clean record and who now seems to be Hal Kines's paternal uncle, paying for the latter's education and providing him food and accommodation. (In fact it is the other way round: Hal Kines, the \"great shot\" and the brains of the syndicate, has a take on Kalecki: Hidden back in the vaults of some bank he has documents showing that Kalecki is a murderer on the loose.) * Michael Kines, who poses as a professor of science but who is in fact the head of a criminal organization specialising in sex and drug-dealing. His very powerful &mdash; and complicated &mdash; way of obtaining willing people for his \"outfit\" can only be understood if One understands the socially repressed culture of the early 1940s: Again and again, he takes the role of Jack Smith, a professor in some provincial school (for instance in the Midwest), pretends falling in love with a female teacher, makes her pregnant, forces her to have an unlawful pregnancy, and then deserts her. By now the woman's happiness has been destroyed, she has been betrayed by both her mother and most likely all her colleagues and neighbors. Then a taxi comes, picks up the desperate elderly girl and drives her straight to one of the New Orleans \"call rooms\" operated by his syndicate. Once there, there is no way for her to escape. * Elizabeth Smith, with whom Hammer falls in love and who, as far as he can tell, has no motive whatsoever to kidnap Williams. Hammer, the third woman protagonist of the novel, portrays her as \"radiating sexuality in this way and gesture\" (\"Mary [Bellemy] only had sex. Charlotte had that plus a bit more.\"). Elizabeth expresses her passion for him, and he explains that he has not been in love before. Soon they talk about being married. Hammer has often admired her \"golden skin\"; but not before the very end, when she strips, does he find out that Charlotte is a \"true girl\". In the course of the action Charlotte Manning saves three men: After making her second crime, she has to cover up her tracks and murder everyone who may be willing to expose her. As Hammer admits, she has an extraordinary amount of luck enabling her to do all that. * Brian Wilson, a former \"dope lover\" who, as it turns out, does not play any significant role in the story at all unlike that of two of the victims: At the Bellemys' party (toward the end of the novel), Mary, alone in an attic bedroom where most of the guests have left their jackets, finds on Charlotte Bennett's jacket and finds heroin in two of its pockets. This is the reason why Manning has to shoot her, too. It takes Hammer and Chambers a short time to figure out what is going on. Manning intends to kill those who have become dangerous for her. At the same moment, her friendship with Hammer deepens. We see something through Hammer's eyes, and for a short moment he is almost blind to the facts (\"I believe you get him,' she said sincerely.\"). During a walk through South City, while Manning is baby-sitting for two of her colleagues, she and Hammer are shot at. The shooter is Kalecki, but it does not become obvious until then that he was after Manning. He misses. On a Sunday night, Hammer picks up Mary Wilson and offers her a lift. They drive to the Bellemy twins' estate in the country for a huge all-day party there. Charlotte Manning explains she has some business to attend to and will be there in time for a football tournament due to take place that evening. After an unsuccessful effort at playing golf himself, Hammer gets rid of his sleep deficit by spending all night in his bed, fast asleep, with \"old junior\" &mdash; his gun &mdash; close to him. He is woken up just in time for supper, during which Harmon Wilder, the Bellemys' attorney, and John Davis, Wilder's secretary, are pointed out to him. This is a fine &mdash; and the final &mdash; distractor in the story: Wilder and Sherman are suddenly missing from the party after Frank Cunningham has been found shot. In case they had illicit substances on them and did not want to be found out. During the football tournament, John Bellemy asks Charlotte if she can \"borrow\" Hammer. Then she leads him into the woods where they have sex. They return to the party just as a maid finds Helen's body in an attic bathroom, in front of a small mirror. Both Pat Chambers and the sheriff are called in, and the alibis of each guest is reviewed. Again Charlotte can tell everyone that she may not have accomplished something. Back home, Hammer retreats into his bedroom to think. Now, he learns the identity of the murderer. This is when he comes to Charlotte's place, recapitulates the entire crime and then shoots her alive, despite her attempts to get the trigger on him.",

Immediately before the initial quest for the Egg itself, Oscar and Star get married. The player then proceeds to enter the building in which the egg has been hidden, navigating a maze of illusions and optical techniques.

He then defeats the last guardian of the Egg, known only as the \"Never-Born\", in a physical battle, and the party disappears with the Egg. While they arrive in the planet of Stars, Rufo tells Oscar that Star is also the princess of other worlds—and Rufo's daughter.

    "After bombings bomb the Egyptian embassy in Paris, agents at Egypt’s intelligence service—better known as the Office—struggle to establish a proper motivation for the attack. The probe finds a CD filled with very sensitive information about Michael Allon, a notorious hit guy for the Office. No longer safe inside of Israel, Gabriel returns reluctantly to his homeland with Italian friend and former Office agent Francesca Zolli. Lev, the previous chief of the Department, has long admired Gabriel’s close connections to David Shamron, former chief of the Department, as much as his previous undercover job for Shamron. Lev demands that Michael officially rejoin the Department so he can benefit from the protection of other agents. Meanwhile, Jacob and Shamron only know that Lev wants to control and curtail their covert operations. Lev encourages Jonathan to remain in Jerusalem and assigns him a research team to identify the bombing and its link to Gabriel. Finally, David, Michael, Yaakov, and Rimona come under Michael’s direction. Dina leads a series of apparently random terrorist bombings and attributes them to Khaled al-Khalifa, a mysterious ancestor of Palestinian warlords. However, Michael points out, Shamron and David each began operations against Omar’s relatives. Although adopted by Sheikh Hussein as a teenager, Khaled grew up abroad and eventually was a visible force outside the IDF. Dina believes that, hidden behind a carefully crafted European identity, Khaled has orchestrated brutal raids against Lebanon, including the recent embassy attack. In fact, all of the bombings are to commemorate the deaths of Palestinians, including Khaled’s brother and organizer of Black Friday, Mustafa al-Khalifa. Sharon believes that the terror is inevitable: she anticipates an act of terrorism to commemorate the Israeli raising of Beit Sayeed, the city of Hussein’s Palestinian grandparents. Only twenty-eight years remain until the fifth anniversary of that event. The viewer finds that Khaled lives as a wealthy and influential British archeologist under the identity of Jacques Martineau. He organizes terrorist raids through an Arab associate in Paris. The author subsequently recognizes that the arrangements for Mohammed’s final attack are underway. As Alex and Isabella settle into a new lifestyle in Egypt, Daniel suggests that Michael dissolve his relationship to Ari and marry Isabella. He also presses Alex to meet with Sheikh Arafat to tell of Khaled’s whereabouts. Daniel’s brother Daniel, a member of the IDF, escorts Gabriel to the Mukataa, Arafat’s compound. While the IDF and Palestinians traditionally work for opposing factions, Arafat consents to the meeting because Gabriel once saved his life. Gabriel goes through Arafat’s evasive responses and lies and reveals that Khaled did not plan the attack of the Egyptian embassy. Gabriel subsequently believes that Abu al-Hourani worked for Abbas, and the truck bombs that murdered his wife and maimed Jonathan was actually intended to end his own happiness. Israel then introduced David to Omar Arwish, a reticent Egyptian informant. Arwish reveals that Khaled contacts Arafat twice and employs a female colleague to relay important telephone messages. Because the most recent of such telephone messages was from Egypt, Michael travels to Cairo. There, he meets Angela Ferrere, a polyglot and social butterfly whose voice matches that of Ali’s collaborator. He bugs her cell, intercepts a text from Khaled, and matches the telephone number to Marseilles. aboard the yacht Fidelity, David meets with his team and David Shamron to plan Ali’s assassination. Unfortunately, Khaled sees their attack and leads Daniel into a trap: he will throw himself into Khaled’s arms or Leah will die; Daniel joins his team to save his son. Khaled’s instructions lead Gabriel to the French Rue de Paris, and Michael learns too early that Khaled plans to bomb the subway depot and pin the murder on Gabriel and Israeli intelligence. With only minutes to spare, Gabriel destroys one of Khaled’s three bombers and rescues Sophia. They return safely to Egypt, but Khaled and Mimi leak footage of Lucien to the press that link him to the massacre at Rue de Marseille.

Isabella refuses to leave Gabriel and returns to Italy. However, Michael finds and kills Khaled at an archaeological excavation in northern Italy. He then returns to Israel and art restoration.",
    "The story opens with Imriel kneeling down to read the letters that his wife, Melisande Shahrizai, has read him all these days. After the incidents in Kushiel's Scion, especially with Canis in Lucca, he is now confused with where she is and the impact she is going to have on his life. The words, while not really comforting, tell him so and help relieve some of his guilt. Phèdre nó Delaunay, his foster-mother, invites him if he needs to discuss them but he declines. When he presents himself to the Princess, he gives her his decision to wed the Alban Queen Dorelei. He had her when he was fourteen and King Talorcan, Drustan's son and heir apparent, wanted to visit\\. While Drustan might prefer to name Alais as his successor, he cannot without avoiding a civil battle. If Alais were to wed Talorcan, she could rule at his side but their sons willn't inherit the kingdom, as Alba works by hereditary succession. Also, if Imriel were to wed Dorelei, his father could remain Cruarch and Terre d'Ange's influence in Alba will not wane. For this reason, he is agreeing to wed her for the betterment of the realm. At the same moment, meanwhile, he has realized that he is attracted to his wife, Marguerite De la Courcel. He believes that she looks the same. He is not the daughter of three notorious criminals and she is the dauphine. They cannot be together. After this, during the Midwinter Masque at the castle, Imriel and Sophie kiss. Only Marie's lady-in-waiting, Amarante, and Imriel's best son, Mavros, know of their friendship. They also assist them in being together and warn them if others are coming to burst in and see them together. However, Sidonie's private soldiers know but are very loyal to her. Maslin of Lombelon is her chief guard and also rumored to be her husband. Given the wedding, Imriel starts to get classes with Alais on Alban history, law, philosophy, and cultural aspects. After these lessons he will meet Marguerite at her quarters and then have a few days alone, often to make love. While Alais does not approve of their marriage, mostly due to the necessary secrecy, she does anything to stop them. During one of these lustful nights, Imriel asks Sidonie about what happened to him in Drujan (see Kushiel's Avatar). She listens patiently but is somewhat annoyed. She then asks if he will not be able to be cruel with her because she will very well like it. For once Imriel appears to be more confident and ready to do this, as long as it is with her. Their marriage continues as such for several years while being successfully hidden from almost everybody. Imriel realizes that his marriage is coming though and continues to get very depressed. He and Sophie realize they can not be together and say that they only like each other because it is forbidden. To release this frustration, Mavros brings him to Valerian Manor once again. Given that Imriel has been drinking, apparently, Mavros books them a showing instead. This seems to be a good thing and only helps Imriel to deal with his past and his Kusheline blood. That year, King Talorcan and Queen Dorelei accompany Drustan on his annual visit to Bois d'Ange in the autumn. Dorelei is gentle and kind-hearted, but Imriel is distracted with his passion for Sidonie. He only wants to wed Dorelei though, because, as Marie herself stated, they are likely only in love with each other because it is forbidden. As well, Catherine is not even seventeen and so can not cross her father's will, making any real marriage with Imriel difficult. Yet now, Imriel is happy to be abandoning her. Dorelei, sensing that he wants another, admits she is ready to share him, as she does D'Angelines do, but that she herself will be only with him, as is Alban custom. Imriel takes this to heart but tells her there is no one else. Before the ceremony, Imriel and Sidonie meet secretly at a Temple of Elua. There the Bishop vows to keep his silence but discourages the two from being so secretive and continuing a affair that will ultimately hurt people. However, he provides them with a private bedroom for their final love-making. Mavros Shahrizai subsequently takes him on a bachelor's party. Imriel is frustrated, jealous, and rough, being in the good mood for Valerian House. Mavros, meanwhile, makes sure that Imriel does not get taken away and is still safe and sane in his play. The next day is the ceremony. This is a private affair with all people of import in attendance. They are offered various decorations, although Imriel's most precious gift is that from Drustan's father: vambraces painted with the image of the Cullach Gorym, their clan crest (their diadh-anam). Finally he is welcomed into the royal residence of Alba. Imriel makes a nice smile on it but inside he gets anything but fear and a hollow sadness. It is cold, he is uncomfortable, and Sophie is right there the entire moment, seeing him wed somebody else. During the wedding, Marie puts rose petals on the couple. Imriel learns the real meaning of this: there is a passage in the Trois-Mille Joies that says to cover your lover in kisses is like falling flower petals. Everyone else at the wedding are happy, making Imriel's brooding and moping all the more interesting, if well-hidden. Dorelei and Imriel make love that day, as Dorelei wants to have a baby, having lit a torch to Eisheth. In the subsequent weeks, Imriel reveals to Dorelei that he is in love with somebody else, to which she answers that she does, but insists that theirs is a marriage of politics. Michael comes at court from Skaldia after losing the favour of his Skaldic daughter Anna's mother. Imriel reveals to Eamonn of his affair with Sidonie. The party bound for Alba make preparations for their arrival when Marie returns from her journey to Naamah's temple. She and Imriel meet at a shrine of Naamah for a final rendezvous before his arrival. The following day, Imriel departs for Alba with a large D'Angeline convoy, Drustan's mother, Phèdre nó Delaunay and Joscelin Verreuil. After the ceremony, they travel from Alba to the King's new residence, Clunderry, with Dorelei's father using the 'open roads' (the taisgaidh), those routes where no person is forced to fight, be killed or attacked, and to where all Albans have access. On his last day on Alban soil, Imriel, missing Sidonie, fantasizes of her and pleasures himself, pouring his seed on the soil. During his night he is awakened by an unmistakable lustful pull. He gives up and follows it. It leads him to a lone Alban girl, Morwen, who appears to have the ability to control him and asks him to have a son with her. Although he wants to refuse, the spell she has cast on him strong. Eventually, some of the Albans from the escort interrupt them and the man disappears. The Albans warn him he was mad indeed. By spreading his seed, filled with his passion and passion, on the common soil, this girl has been given the tools to ensnared him by creating a little mannekin of him, enabling her to call on him when she wants. They also tell him that the three claw tattoos on her face means she is of the Maghuin Dhonn. The spell is weak and his only help is to go to an Ollamh, a religious druid-like figure. The Ollamh casts a spell on him as well and binds each of his limbs with black ribbon. Imriel can always wear a croonie-stone around his waist to protect himself. If any of these are taken off or broken, the spell will be broken and he will be under the woman's control again. Imriel looks relieved and more clear-headed than he has been in years. There is a slight shift in his mood; while not self-consumed, he does not seem as happy as he was before and is eager to make love to Dorelei. Dorelei, meanwhile, loses her visions of the future, as if a huge dark cloud were covering them from her sight. Yet, Clunderry is quiet and typical of an Alban noble's house, filled with men who are the salt of the earth. He easily makes friends with her soldiers and those under his command. Although new, he is admired by all, but few are quite reserved about this new D'Angeline pretty-boy Prince. He loses their admiration, even, when he stages a raid on a neighbouring nobleman, Leodan of Briclaedh. This knight is challenging him and tries to seize his horses and goats, believing Imriel to be in a position of strength. Imriel stuns everyone by then staging a raid on him before Leodan can do the same. Such attacks are done in fun and not of any real risk, just to prove a ruler's courage. Imriel manages to escape from several attacks with virtually no casualties, gaining him admiration and admiration from all. This also garners him a good relationship with Urist, a guard of Clunderry of great reputation and very loved by the soldiers. On the ride away, Imriel is elated. He now feels he is recognized and respected, not because of his birth but because he has deserved it. Then he gets the lustful pull. With volition, he rides into a sheltered grassy region, where the girl is sitting. He wants to resist as far as he can, but his body calls to her regardless. They are disturbed before something more can come, and Imriel discovers that, during the fight, one of his red ties has been cut off. Before ever coming to the celebration banquet, he turns to the local Ollamh, who recasts the spell. Life goes as it will in an Alban holding, and Dorelei and Imriel manage to have a working friendship, and in some way, love. Dorelei is most definitely in love with Imriel, but Imriel does not seem to feel anything strongly. While he respects her and portrays her as very kind, he is ultimately tied up in his own own feelings and problems, although he is unable to think about Sidonie most of the time. Dorelei has not become pregnant and Imriel can not wait for his baby. This is his true bond of love with Dorelei, and his amazement at the life outside her is filled with beauty. Imriel's daughter, Alais, only grows and develops greatly at Clunderry. She has been studying the arts of the Ollamh and enjoys it. Although she does not love Talorcan, she is letting her doors open and does not refuse him. Talorcan is patient. Then one day, a letter comes. Sidonie reads to him informing him that, despite the distance, she is not in love with him. She wants him to stay in Alba, however, for at least the next month. Dorelei had promised him that, if Imriel was not happy after the last season, he would take her and move away to Sainte d'Ange. They would be as Drustan and Ysandre and remember each other half the time, or maybe more. While writing this letter, Imriel is disgusted at his lack of emotions. He can hardly quite picture Sophie's face, and all emotions for her are muted beyond comprehension. Finally he refuses to take a risk. He removes the croonie-stone from around his waist and writes the letter. He is filled with joy and joy. He misses her deeply and really wants her as well. After a short while and writing the letter a number of times, he returns the croonie-stone around his waist and returns to his room with Dorelei. By autumn, Dorelei is very large from her birth, and she and Imriel are looking ahead to their second son, who should be born later. While passion has evolved between to the two, Imriel is always distracted by his passion for Sidonie, although he is still loving and caring with Dorelei. A couple months after the Day of Misrule, however, Morwen disappears out of the woods right in front of Clunderry's men. She remains on the taisgaidh roads, but demands to find Imriel. Imriel meets her with all of his guards, the Ollamh, Alais, and Dorelei who insisted on going along. Morwen thinks she is ready to do a bargain with Imriel: if he will come with her to the circle of standing stones and let her show him the future, she will bring him his mannekin, thus freeing him of her magic. The circle is not far away and is on taisgaidh lands. Imriel does not trust her but she says that if he decides to get his troops he can, so long as they stay inside of the circle. Imriel then asks the advice of the Ollamh. She does not trust Morwen as well and learns that before the wedding and in the stone circle, Morwen swear not to harm Imriel or any of his clan. She agrees without doubt and with none of the tell-tales of a lie. Imriel insists he will give the time to decide and give her his decision at dawn. Morwen agrees and leaves as if she had melted into the woods themselves. Imriel and Dorelei consider it that night and come to a decision. Imriel will bring a small escort of the troops to the circle with him and be careful. Dorelei will not risk herself or the child by going with him and will leave in Clunderry with the remaining guards. While it is dangerous, for the freedom of Imriel, the visions of Dorelei, and their unborn son, it will be worth it. They also now take on the name of the baby: Aniel if it is a girl and Anielle if it is a woman. That evening, Dorelei makes Imriel pull on his vambraces and prepare for his meet with Morwen. At the edge of taisgaidh roads, Morwen arrives. After Imriel's arrival, she leads them to the standing stones. Evening has fallen, and although there are several of Imriel's soldiers holding candles, the circle now has an odd feel about it. Morwen reminds him that he can not wear any metal outside the circle and that the lights should be put out. He explains why and she only replies that that is how the spell works. To verify his safety, he invites her to take the pledge with the Ollamh only. Morwen and the Ollamh go into the circle. Morwen swears: ::\"No harm will happen Imriel De La Courcel of Clunderry this day, nor any member of his family, nor any woman dear to him. I say it by the stone and sea and moon, by all the gods of Alba, and by the diadh-anam of the Maghuin Dhonn. If I lie, let my magic be broken and my life be forfeit. Let each boy and man's hand be raised against me, let my name be gall on their tongues. Let the gods and the diadh-anam forsake me, and let the land itself despise my footfall. Let my soul wander for several million days without solace.\" The Ollamh is pleased and departs for the outside of the circle. Morwen brings Imriel into the circle, after asking him to take off his clothes. She suddenly lifts one of the standing stones and gets out her things from under it, letting it fall back down behind her. On the stone table, she places her things and gets some coffee, which she drinks first before handing it to Imriel. He asks her what it is. She explains it is mushroom tea and a gift of the earth. She then paints her eyelids and his. Pulling up the stone dagger and a cloth sack she passes the pack to him. He feels the mannekin inside it. Morwen then slowly cuts his bindings and all his love, emotions, and reality comes flooding forward. Morwen then cuts her hands and holds his arms. Waiting, the tea begins to have an impact. Then he comes to realize that the stones are telling him a tale. He finds a man who is not his unborn child, Gabriel. He finds Dorelei dead with Aniel grabbing on to him. He finds his mother with Alais and then, as a boy, yelling at Urist. Then there is a pause. Morwen thinks this is because he has left Alban shores. He returns, however, and Imriel can see the glitter of intelligence in his eyes and delight at the causing of arguments. These arguments lead to battles between the tribes of Alba and the death of Talorcan. He is then named Cruarch and leads thousands of D'Angeline warriors to Alba, shattering all resistance. He finds men and girls taken out of their houses and their houses being bombed. He sees Aniel kill a dead woman pleading for forgiveness. Aniel burns the sacred trees and drags out the standing stones. He is a ruthless and brutal leader who hunts down the Maghuin Dhonn until all are done, and changes Bryn Gorrydum into a D'Angeline city. However, Imriel asks her to stop and she does, letting go of his arms. \"Your father is a demon, Imriel,\" she says. Imriel knows why this is. She replies that she does not remember, and at last the visions were of different possibilities. Dorelei must die before her next son is born and Imriel leaves Alban shores. At last there was Imriel and Morwen's daughter to balance Aniel, but now all that was was this one vision. Imriel asks if she believed that her intervention prevented this in the first place, and if she considered not being engaged. With deep regret, she said she had considered it. Imriel sees horns and recognizes the flaws in Morwen. Realizing the cuts were wider than he though he knows an unpleasant secret. Morwen has lied, harm is coming to Imriel's mother. Her life is sacrificed for the good of the Maghuin Dhonn. He arrives away to Clunderry, barely under the effects of the mushroom tea. All is in a haze and blurry. The doors of the fortress are opened; Leodan of Briclaedh staged his counter cattle-raid on this night after seeing that the troops must be elsewhere. A huge bear is now attempting to enter the palace. Imriel charges him, but is grabbed by a huge claw and goes unconscious. When he arrives, he finds Dorelei sitting on a table nearby, apparently alive. Imriel slips into a deep depression. He has been badly clawed by the bear, the Maghuin Dhonn shape-shifter leader Berlik. He is transferred to Bryn Gorrydum and being treated by an Eisandine practitioner. Alais will keep him company most nights, but vengeance was what kept him alive; he saw Berlik's death. The hunt for Berlik in Alba was successful, but Hyacinthe, the master of the Straits, watched a huge bear swim to Azzalle, through the straits. While he might not be convinced it was Berlik, Imriel was. Imriel thinks he will take out Berlik's head and bury it as Dorelei's feet, a customary custom of Alba. Urist promises to find him, as do a number of Clunderry's soldiers. When Imriel is eventually judged to be well enough to ride, he reminds Drustan of the arrangements, says farewell to Alais, and departs for Bois d'Ange. In Azzalle, Urist and Imriel destroy the mannekin and cut his bindings. Imriel asks him who it was he knew all this time and, while shocked, Urist still dedicates himself to Imriel's service: \"So you were good enough for the Cullach Gorrym, strong enough to marry Dorelei mab Beidaia, strong enough to beget Alba a successor, but not bad enough for the King's son?\" They all ride for the Hall of Elua, devoted to true love and the hunt for Berlik. After arriving at the Tower, Imriel then comes to Marguerite's quarters, sinks to his knees before her and wraps his hands around her neck. Ysandre walks in on the scene and is shocked. Imriel walks out from the Palace, but not before Sidonie kisses him before the all those watching. Mavros gives the Shahrizai hunting estates inside of the City for Imriel and the Albans to keep out of the turmoil of the City. Sophie goes to find him. After lovemaking, a palace bodyguard led by Lord Amaury Trente come to get her back home. She refuses, stating she is a grown girl now over the age of majority, and that she will love who she loves freely. Imriel discovers that Phèdre and Joscelin now are not back from their mysterious trip, but he visits the house and has a nice visit with all. After gathering all the supplies and funding he wants, including from the palace coffers despite Ysandre's opinion of his relationship with her mother, he and the Albans depart for the east. Their trip brings them through the Flatlands toward the new kingdom of Vralia. Imriel and Urist then book passage by ship to the city of Vralia, following Berlik's trail. After being abandoned on an island for at least a week, they both make it to the city Vralgrad. Urist is too injured to continue, however, and stays in Vralgrad. Imriel begins to follow rumours of Berlik south to the little village of Tarkov. Imriel has the odd good timing, apparently, to be in Tarkov for a Tartar raid. Seeing the scars on his behind left from Daršanga, the men believe that he is a secret assassin of the Mongols and put him in prison. He is trapped there for a short period with one other Tartar prisoner. He seeks to escape through cunning, and lets free his Tartar companion so that he will be able to go again to the man he loves. From there Imriel follows the long-stale route of Berlik, or what he believes is Berlik's route. He stops at a large Yeshuite Temple in Miroslas, the last reaches of civilization, and finds that Berlik remained there for a year, wanting forgiveness. They want to discourage him from hunting down Berlik, but Imriel departs, now dedicated to his quest. He spends several hours and hours searching the untamed woods in search of Berlik. He gets almost crazy with the silence, despair, and seemingly despair of his mission. He is obliged to give out his dog, hoping it will bring it alive to a warm stable, for lack of adequate meat and fodder. Just before determining that he should turn out before he starves, Berlik leaves him a sign. Following this trail he happens upon a large cabin that Berlik has built and still now lives in. There is a makeshift cross in his cabin and a flame still burning. Here, now, Berlik emerges. He is humbled and broken and wants only for his death, for only his resurrection at the hands of Imriel can give him atonement. Berlik tells him, \"I prayed...I left a road for you to follow, and I prayed that if you found me, the diadh-anam will recognize my sacrifice as salvation, and not punish all of her men for my failure. When my magic came to me, here in the woods, I felt it was so.\" Imriel knows why Berlik made it so hard for him. He responds, \"would you have gone here with a humble soul if I had not?\" Berlik confesses his mistakes, his doubts, and realizes that he should have respected his gods more then of only himself. He apologizes to Imriel and calls him \"my avenging angel.\" As Imriel brings his weapon, he learns the real meaning that Kushiel, the punisher of god, knew his charges too well. Imriel says, \"I'm sorry,\" cuts off Berlik's head cleanly, and weeps. After a time in Berlik's cabin, gathering more meat and supplies, he departs again for his far-away home. After hours of trudging, he is shocked to see voices yelling in Rus and D'Angeline! They are not rescuers, apparently: they are men from Tarkov, come to capture him. The D'Angeline they are talking with is Maslin of Lombelon, sent by Sidonie to find Imriel. Maslin and Imriel manage to fight off the soldiers and make a truce of their once jealousy of each other. Maslin, it appears, has grown much in his travels as well. During their journey through the woods, Maslin ends up boiling Berlik's head for Imriel, in a sense of penance. It is disgusting work, but Maslin agrees to see Imriel do it. They then continue on their journeys. They travel separately again to Tarkov. They want to disguise Imriel but Tarkov is the nearest port for trains headed to the capital and then home. When they arrive in Tarkov, however, they see Phèdre and Joscelin, come to search for Imriel and join him on his long journey. Phèdre is talking with the guards, attempting to say he is a royal prince of Terre d'Ange and not a Tartar. While they do not recognize her, none seem to challenge them and grudgingly \"allow\" them to leave. In the city, Joscelin discovers his once pupil and now commander of the Yeshuites and most reliable adviser of King Vral, David ibn Ximon. As the climate improves, they make a ship down to the Flatlands and travel to Azzalle. Maslin decides to stay in Vralia as a representative of Terre d'Ange, and because he has fallen in love with a local girl. Once they are again in Ville d'Ange, all are surprised to report their departure. (this material is derived from the preview at the end of the paper-back version of Kushiel's Justice) Imriel rushes away to Sidonie's side. The Queen has slowed down somewhat but cannot countenance the affair because of Imriel's parents. She cannot denounce it, therefore, because to do so will be to be against Elua's Precept. He, Marguerite, Phèdre, Joscelin, and his Alban escort return to Clunderry to bury Berlik's head, fulfilling Imriel's vow. On their return to the City of Elua, they are met by a small group of men with red armbands, the victims of Melisande and Benedicte's machinations, showing a thumbs-down (see Kushiel's Mercy).",
    "The game is set in a vaguely described science fiction future dominated by \"The Game,\" a conflation of pop art and violence played by \"Markers\" under the direction of \"The Keepers.\" Hoss has attempted to remain the top Marker, only to find himself questioning his own powers in the face of hostility from \"Gypsies\" who operate outside of the official rules. Section 1: Eager to take an outing, Hoss is distracted when the Star-Man warns him against it on the basis of his astrology. Hoss discovers that his rival, Mojo Root Force, has invaded on his territory in Las Vegas in a move of dubious legitimacy. After gaining word that a Gypsy from Nevada is on his way to attack him, Hoss sends an old acquaintance, Little Willard, for backup, only to find that Willard has committed suicide due to his failure to cope with his status. These successive revelations exacerbate Hoss's self-doubt and his conviction that the old way is dying, and he attempts to perk up his confidence by challenging the Gypsy to a shiv duel. Act III: Before the battle (which has been changed from a shiv duel to war of words under the advice of an official referee) Hoss and Crow attempt to psych each other out. While Crow tries to imitate Buck's walk and style, Buck intimidates Crow by putting on the voice of an old Western cowboy. After an apparently effective final round in which he takes on the voice of a Mississippi bluesman, Buck wins the fight when Crow exposes Buck's \"fear that he's crackin' busted in one.\" After destroying the Ref, a desperate Hoss begs Crow to teach him the new style. Eventually, however, he chooses to commit his final authentic act by destroying himself, for which Raven recognizes him. The game begins with Crow assuming his spot on Hoss' throne, with Nora slowly shifting her loyalty.",

    "The horses' owners, the Hunters, leave go to Europe for many weeks because Peter, the father, is scheduled to take a series of university lectures there. They leave their pets in the care of William Longridge, a family friend and uncle of their mother, Mary. One night, after Mary Longridge leaves for a three day duck hunting vacation, the dogs, knowing the absence of their human companions, set out to try to locate their owners, the Hunters. Mrs. Smith, who is taking care of Longridge's house, doesn't know the horses and believes that Frank may have taken them with him. The dogs follow their instincts and move back toward home, only 300 kilometers ways. * Luath: Luath is a young Labrador. His coat is red-gold, his ears are blue, and he is of sturdy build. Luath is a faithful and brave companion and the natural leader of the group. Of the four pets, he is the most recent addition. He is always the most determined to push ahead and reach home and the Hunters. Luath usually walks on Bodger's left side to guide him because the younger dog is completely deaf in his left eye. He is probably the person who loses the most from lack of food because after a porcupine hits him in the forehead with its quills, the wounds become infected, making it impossible for him to open his mouth. * Bodger: Bodger (whose full surname is Ch. Boroughcastle Brigadier of Doune) is an old British bull dog. His coat is brown with a slight reddish colour. Bodger's left eye is almost blind. The animal was born to fight and endure (as he does in the novel). Because he is ten months old, Bodger tires quickly; but he is a brave, loyal, persevering and tenacious companion. He is very wary of animals, especially children, and if the trio comes across animals in their travels, he manages to charm them for affection and snacks, with varying outcomes. He has an intense affection toward all animals save Tao, who earned his affection by standing up to him when he first befriended the Wolf clan as a little kitten. Although they care intensely for Luath, Bodger and Tao have a unique bond. Bodger is the last of the animals to have rejoined the Wolf clan. Despite his advanced age and diminished senses, Bodger is now every bit the fighter he was in his prime, at one point rescuing Luath from a Border Collie sicced on them by an angry farmer. * Tao: Tao is a tall, seal-pont, old style Siamese cat with sapphire eyes. An aspect of humor in the novel is that Tao, unlike Bodger, hates other animals, and the three once shared several stories terrorizing the other cats in their neighborhood; when they encounter other feral animals in their travels, Tao also fights them, unsuccessfully. Tao is willing to open most windows, a help to the animals in many cases. Tao is a tireless, bold, and loyal dog. Tao is also the worst equipped of the two to survive in the desert, and has no trouble remaining on his own when separated from the three animals; Despite this, he spends all his time trying to rejoin them, a testament to the bond between the humans. The dog is an independent and natural hunter, catching large animals for the group. When Tao is separated from them, the animals fare more well without Tao than Tao does without them. However, Tao is essential to the animals' survival. * John Longridge: John Longridge is Elizabeth Hunter's father. He lives in a stone cottage in a little town about 300 kilometres from the college city where the Hunters live. Mr. Longridge wrote many historical novels, is a journalist by career, and a bachelor. * The Hunter Families: The Hunter Family consists of the husband Peter, the wife and their three sons, 11 year old John and 9 year old Peter. Peter owns Luath, Peter owns Tao, and John buys Bodger. * Mrs. Wilson: Mrs. Wilson is the housekeeper of the two dogs while Peter is gone on his honeymoon. Her son is Bert. * The Nurmi Family: The Nurmi family are a clan of German settlers. 10 year old Helvi takes a liking to Tao after she discovers him unconscious in the water while walking home from college. * The Mackenzies: Ian and his girlfriend, Kate, are an older couple who reside alone, now that their two kids have grown up. They know Bodger and Luath, and provide them with a place to stay.",
    "The book is followed by a paragraph entitled \"Questions\", which consists of five verses numbered in Greek numerals. I Chandra Chagoo is attacked by Ahmed Aziz, who suggests Chagoo has been answering questions in order to gather proof for the police. II Dr Gauri Prasad contemplates facing Chagoo and demanding just what he thinks about her past. She fears he knows something. III Dr Ram Singh lectures a class of medical professors about the necessity of answering answers. Privately he proposes imminent professional ruin for answering the incorrect answer. IV Professor Phaterpaker also contemplates professional destruction as a consequence of Ram Mahipal's suggestion, the question to which Chagoo now believes. The preface begins. The major body of the book opens with the heading: Answer The Commissioner informs Ghote that a criminal called Ali Aziz has provided Bombay movie stars with drugs from the Mira Behn Institute. Ghote is ordered to see who stole drugs from the institution and arrest them under a false charge to prevent a scandal. Ghote warns the Commissioner that he recently spotted an airport attendant, Carla D'Costa, trafficking drugs for Amir Aziz. The Chief explains he will assign the policeman to manage Nick D'Costa as an informant and that it will make a stronger cop than Ghote to get Ahmed Aziz to justice. Ghote questions Asha Devi, a film star. Her \"uncle\" Dr Singh gave a sample of a medication named A.C.E. and almost died. Singh, who initially provided Dr Gupta with heroin, supplied the A.C.E. At the university, Ghote interviews Prof Phaterpaker. The Professor admits he will go to any lengths to protect the institute. The institute's work is mainly concerned with creating new drugs from the venom of poisonous insects. Prof Prasad then suspects Chandra Chagoo of having lost the A.C.E. and leads Ghote to the reptile house. When the lock is unlocked they see Chagoo alive with a Russell's snake loose in the house. The next morning the Superintendent assigns Ghote to investigate Chagoo's murder to prevent the affair being uncovered by the policeman. Ghote believes that Chagoo did not have a keys to lock the reptile bedroom lock and would have been arrested. Ghote interviews Prof Ram Singh, who left a reptile-room key in his old desk at the university when he finally resigned his work. Ghote hears from the house owner that Mahipal disappeared in order to access his computer files on the day Chagoo died. Prof Kumar, Prof Phaterpaker, Mr Singh and the construction owner were all in the house at the moment. Ghote suspects that the murder might be an employee at the nearby hospital. He joins the officer originally assigned to Chagoo's murder to test this hypothesis. On their last meet Mahipal insists he moved to teaching in hopes of instilling credibility in young medical scholars. Mahipal left the university because he knew that Phaterpaker faked results, not on a daily basis. Phaterpaker takes the news that Chagoo was murdered casually, saying that Mahipal was slipshod and saying that he was dismissed for this. Ghote tries to decide just why Mahipal left, but Phaterpaker is confused. When Phaterpaker realizes he himself is a suspect, he is affronted but hates \"cutting corners\" and acts like a person with nothing to hide. Ghote explains that Phaterpaker is going to use Mahipal as a scapegoat to protect the institute. Mrs Subbiah reacts harshly when asked about her relations with Chagoo, however Ghote confirms she is not the murderer. Ghote learns that Mrs Singh's wife works as a cook at the medical college and is a Hindu, while Mahipal claims to be a member of the Hindu caste. Ghote asserts that Singh misrepresented himself in order to have a college college reserved for the higher classes. Mahipal confesses this is so. Ghote suggests Chagoo wanted to know Singh's secret and was arrested because of this. Mahipal confirms this and argues that he left the institute because Phaterpaker was using laboratory animals that had undesirable results. At the police station, Ghote is relieved when the officer he is working with points out two of the two doctors will not hang for the murder and expresses a preference that it be Dr Rao. At the institute Ghote accuses Phaterpaker of stealing exam results. Phaterpaker believes his findings are false. He was sure that Chagoo was stealing drugs from the institute but was obliged to agree to a pact because Chagoo believed Phaterpaker was using lab animals. Ghote explores the reptile room and realises wooden stool may have been used to break the glass, so he asks to have it dusted for fingerprints. At the police station Ghote discovers that Angela D'Costa has murdered, her neck slit after answering too few questions of Ahmed Aziz. Ghote is furious enough to confront the commissioner, but realizes Ali had arranged to be in hospital during the robbery. The forensic tests do not see a match between any fingerprints on the stool and Ghote's two suspects. Nor can they prove it was designed to break the glass of the viper's cage. Ghote comes home and argues with his father, then inspiration strikes and he returns to the institute. There he searches the grounds for evidence someone can gain access by night. The security guard catches Ghote and he can ask his fellow inspector to rescue him. Afterwards Ghote chances on Dr Subbiah. Ghote explains that Phaterpaker wanted her to \"anticipate\" the results of her studies, as Phaterpaker himself was once persuaded. The dialogue between Ghote and Kumar is disrupted when, by chance, they pass the funeral of Nicky D'Costa. Ghote asks Subbiah how Nicky D'Costa was assassinated and proceeds to question her about her exam findings. Subbiah remarks that Ahmed Aziz was a doctor at the teaching hospital recently. Ghote asks if she anticipated her findings before completing the actual experiment. She suggests faking her results. Ghote now believes that Lakshmi is the killer. He accuses her and she reacts in disgust, noting that Chagoo was not murdered. Ghote admits that he only witnessed the body lying face down, and the officer previously assigned to the case personally forwarded the psychiatric examination's report. Ghote believes that Chagoo should not have been murdered by Ravi or Phaterpaker because neither of them have the proper strength. Dr Singh has a withered leg, eliminating him as a suspect. Returning to the police station, Ghote speaks to the forensic specialist who examined the stool from the institute reptile room. The expert says he only compared the fingerprints on the chair to the four suspects Ghote named; Shankar, Phaterpaker and Singh. With Khan's file in front of him, he can not detect the fingerprints. Khan's file is retrieved and his fingerprints are a good match. Ghote decides he can arrest and charge Khan with rape and remembers, with satisfaction, the words used by Commissioner's at the start of the case: \"Well, Detective, it will make a bigger person than you to get paid to Ali Aziz\".",
    "Soraya, Raj and Jiaan have decided to work together to defeat the Hrum and free Farsala. Unfortunately, suspicion of Kavi is affecting this attempt. The two attempt to work together, but it becomes impossible. However, they have now discovered the secret of watersteel, with the aid of Kavi's inability to \"speak\" to metal. Only a few days remain in the Hrums self-imposed limit to conquer Farsala. The two men realize that Garren, the Strategus in charge of the empire, has more riding on the conquest than just Farsala. His son, a member of the House of the Hrum Empire, said that Garren will destroy Farsala with only fifty million soldiers. In addition, his son said that he will retire from the Senate if this is not done. He did these things in order to secure the assignment of the Farsalan conquest to his father. Garren's son's allies are anxious for this to happen. When Garren requisitions gold to hire Kadeshi aid and circumvent the troop sanction, the Senate sends a committee to review the conquest. Kavi, Jiaan and Ali intend to capture the gold before it reaches the Kadeshi, as a Kadeshi ruler has told Jiaan that if he refuses to pay, the ruler will order the soldiers he sent Garren to betray the Hrum, crippling the army. Jiaan, Raj and Ali do not wish for this to happen. Ali, with Raj accompanying her, visits the rebels and tells them to rob the Senate delegation, which will arrive at the nearby harbor of Dugaz. They say that if the delegation is robbed during its stay, it will prove to the Senate that Garren does not have the world under control. Meanwhile, on arriving at the rebels' lair, Shir, their commander, informs Kavi and Ali that the Senate met a month later, and the rebels tried to rob them. Disappointed, the two promise Shir that in exchange for helping them go, they will find the Suud to try to produce a remedy for the swamp fever plaguing the bandits. The gold comes in Setesafon, and under Garren's close supervision. Using stolen Hrum disguises, Kavi escapes the mansion, trying to find the passwords into the vault, but is captured. Before he is captured he burns the words into his horse's saddle, which Jiaan and Ali find. Jiaan and Ali enter the temple under a disguise that Jiaan has captured Soraya. They release the gold into barrels in the river. After the silver is found missing Garren orders Kavi killed, but Kavi withstands it. Garren publicly declares that if Sorahb does not fight Garren as a champion of Farsala, Kavi will be killed. While Jiaan finds the challenge to be a trap and does not realize Kavi will be destroyed, Fasal refuses the challenge. After Fasal breaks Garren's blade with the newly-developed Farsalan watersteel, Garren orders Fasal assassinated. The Farsalans start protesting and Soraya, enraged, employs magic to kill Garren with lightning. The senate council is convinced Farsala is not subdued, and declares the Hrum will take Farsala as an allied nation. The remaining people send representatives, and Kavi, much to his dismay, is appointed to be a \"councilherd\" of the city; to ensure things run smoothly. Jiaan is asked to accompany the Hrum on their last campaign, that in Kadesh; he agrees. Soraya goes to live with the Suud.",
    "The emphasis of the novel is on the first-person protagonist, a grandfather called Ivan. He arrives home from German exile after the battle to see his daughter Ursula in an adulterous marriage. Over the course of the novel, he seeks to take her back. In this regard, he is unsuccessful, knowing that she is being insane and in this connection only gets to him. The family history goes over many decades, showing many torn characters and multiple crimes, including his father's death and murder. In a pivotal flashback, it is discovered that Peter requested the execution of a German colonel during World War III. This is executed helplessly and without judgment by the Commissar Order. After that, Josef needlessly kills the corpse of crouching men. Towards the end of the novel, the psychological confusion of Elizabeth is explained. The \"visitors\" that she wants to be in her house, are in fact the family representatives of the dead. They exist again in the novel on a fictional level as a quasi-ghost figure, while at the same moment the heroes seem to be real. The viewer sees this as the real family members continue to die. However, the first-person narration suddenly turns out to be the spirits of the dead children.",
    "During World War II, at a secret Soviet submarine base, boxes carved mostly from looted war gold were hidden away. The treasure was not the solid-gold chests, but the cargo they carried - an artifact so dangerous that whoever possessed \"Pandora's Box\" held the power to unleash hell on mankind.... In the unforgiving wastes of Antarctica, scientist John Smith finds a long - abandoned U.S. Navy base buried under the snow - and a long-dead body now hot with radiation. Before Smith and his wife, the seductive Dr. Sara Miller, can explain further, a flash fire destroys the base, and they are ordered to evacuate. But their helicopter is allowed to land when a bomb is discovered on board, and they must find refuge from the murderous weather in a secret ice tunnel. That's where they find the startling truth.

But one of the corporate spies understands what's inside the Pandora boxes, and he plans to take the whole planet captive - if Mercer can find a way to stop him....",
    "The disappearance of Dr. John Pettifer from his teaching position at Bath College shouldn't have bothered a good many things, even a retired Treasury boffin like John Cranmer. But when Police Sergeant Smith and Inspector Luck of the Somerset Detective call on Cranmer at his Oxfordshire mansion home and vineyard late on a Saturday afternoon, Cranmer finds himself facing repercussions from his secret and not-too-distant past. Pettifer, the viewer later learns, was a German Secret Intelligence Service operative during the Cold War and Cranmer was his handler for some five months. The Cold War is over, the Moscow Wall has gone down and SIS has pulled Cranmer and his agent Pettifer out to pasture. Pettifer moves to studying at Bristol College and Cranmer is content to settle at Honeybrook, his inherited property in Gloucestershire, growing wine and making love to his attractive elderly wife Margaret. Not content with staying cloistered in Bath, Peter starts paying visits to Honeybrook and quickly becomes a permanent fixture in their lives. At least, that is, until both John and Michael appear. Panicked by his encounter with the Bath Police, Cranmer contacts his former employers and is summoned to England where he finds that, not only has George escaped, he's absconded with some ₤37 million milked from the German Treasury with the assistance of a former Soviet spy. Cranmer finds himself arrested as Peter's murderer by the Bath Police—and, eventually, by \"The Office,\" or SIS—and decides to track down his protégé and his former lover. But why should a quixotic intellectual like Peter, a guy who had no interest in money, then intend to steal ₤37 billion from the Germans? To resolve this puzzle, Cranmer starts calling on old connections from London to the arms trade to find out what his former agent and his purloined wife have been up to in their disappearance. He frequently visits his hidden archive of Office documents, tucked back in the abandoned monastery of St. John the More, donated to him by the same Grandpa John who left him Honeybrook. As he finds his cache of files, he starts to identify the plot between Peter and Vladimir Checheyev, the former Russian handler of Larry (the latter one wanted to work for Soviets during the Cold War). Checheyev, it appears, is not Ukrainian but Azerbaijani, a native of the high Ukraine and begrudged of the Germans who have displaced him and his people from their rightful homes. The Ingush are primed for an uprising against their Russian rulers and Larry's the person to arm them. Cranmer continues his trip, first to an arms manufacturer in Manchester, Cheshire, whom he believes betrayed along with his assistants by an Ossetian group named \"The Forest;\" then to find Sasha, who has sought refuge in France; then to Moscow to track down his former Soviet contacts in hopes of helping Larry; then to Russia to see his son and try to save him - from the Germans, the Russians and from himself.",
    "The story describes the exploits of Detroit process server Mike Smith, who has a reputation for helping people who don't need to be found. A string of apparently unrelated murders leads Jake to the search for a missing stockholder named only as \"unknown person #89,\" but his missing person isn't \"mysterious\" to anyone: a pretty girl loves his guts, and a very bad guy named Virgil Royal wants him alive in the best manner. This is very bad for Frank, who is then caught in the crossfire of a fatal triple-cross and becomes as much a target as his nameless prey. Along the way, Smith butts heads with local cops, including six-shooter-carrying Steve Speed. The novel is probably best known for a sequence taken down from The Godfather, where thug Virgil plants a gun in the meeting spot of his victim, in this instance, the fire escape of Richard Lear's motel bathroom. Also of note is homosexual wannabe gangster Eddie, whose \"superfly\" haircut was emulated by many of Elmore James's other villains.",
    "The plot concerns mischievous magical beings, the Gremlins of the title, frequently interpreted by Royal Air Force squadrons as an explanation of mechanical problems and accidents. In Dahl's novel, the gremlins' motive for destroying British aviation is revenge of the destruction of their forest house, which was abandoned to make way for an airplane manufacturer. The primary protagonist in the novel, Jack, has his Hawker Typhoon fighter crashed over the English Channel by a gremlin, but is unable to tell the gremlins as they parachute into the river that they should join forces against a common foe, Nazis and the Allies, rather than fight each other. Meanwhile, the gremlins are re-trained by the Imperial Air Force to repair rather than destroy aircraft, and restore Gus to active aircraft status after a very serious crash.The novel had an autobiographical connection as Dahl had flown as a Hurricane fighter pilot in the Luftwaffe, and was temporarily on leave from operational flying after severe injuries suffered in a crash landing in Egypt. He subsequently turned to flying. The novel often provides picturesque descriptions about the everyday lives of gremlins: baby gremlins, for example, are known as widgets, and females as fifinellas, a nickname given from the beautiful \"flying\" filly racehorse Fifinella, that won both the Epsom Oaks and Epsom Derby in 1916, the day Dahl was born.",

Anna instantly recognises her friend Boris as one of the hostages. He wants her to go to Russia and join the Nihilists, a terrorism group seeking to kill the Tsar, and avenge his imprisonment. She and her husband's bodyguard Tom leave to join the Nihilists. Years ago, Anna has become the Nihilists' top spy, and is wanted throughout America. She is in love with a former Nihilist named Gabriel: apparently, Nihilists are sworn not to marry. A Nihilist meeting is almost broken up by troops, but Alexander escapes the soldiers by exposing his real identity: he is the Tsar, heir to the Russian throne. This act wins him the further respect of Vera and the admiration of the Nihilists. At a parliament session, Emperor Alexander and his cruel epigrammatic secretary Prince Michael Maraloffski criticise Tsarovitch Alexis's political leanings, but the Emperor is killed by Alexander after the Tsarovitch opened the door. Alexis ascends the throne and exiles Prince Alexander Maraloffski, not to Moscow, but to Moscow. Maraloffski sends the Nihilists to kidnap Victor. The task of killing the Emperor is presented to Elena. She will infiltrate the mansion, stab the Emperor and throw the sword out the door as a signal to Nihilist agents below. If she does not, the agents will break in and kill him. Elena is willing to kill the person she wants, however. Alexander arrives to the throne after his coronation, wanting to end violence in Europe during his coronation. Olga exits the castle, sword at the ready. Alexander invites her to marry him. She accepts, but then she hears the agents inside shouting out for the signal. She stabs herself and pulls the knife out the door, and the agent departs satisfied. :Alexis: Vera, what have you accomplished? :Vera: I have saved Russia. [dies]",
    "Copying his son's strategy of relying on the most influential commanders of the three generals (Colonel Thomas E. Lee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, Lt. Gen. William H. \"Stonewall\" Jackson, and Lieutenant General John Butler), Shaara portrayed the psychological drama of veterans fighting old comrades while accurately describing historical details including army movements, tactics, and tactical battle situations. Colonel Montgomery, for example, spends much of the book dreading the time he will have to fire on his brother in the Confederate Navy, Thomas \"Lo\" Armistead. The book often deals with Colonel Jackson's frustration with the Confederate government and General Lee's political fervor. In addition to covering events leading up to the battle, the novel details the events of Second Bull Run, Gettysburg, Gettysburg, and Gettysburg. The film version contains only brief coverage of immediate pre-war events, concentrating mainly on Lee and the secession of Georgia, and omits the Siege of Gettysburg.",

The novel describes itself in three parallel parts: One of the narratives is during his time in the asylum, all a memory suddenly pulling itself back to life; the other story takes place after he is released, and he feels compelled to author a novel on the events surrounding that death. He has no paper, so he writes his story on the wall and is continually challenged with unnecessary interruptions.

In Tomb of Horror, the adventurers encounter a number of tricks and traps while trying to penetrate the tomb of a dead witch. As the scenario progresses, the players are told that the evil magician Acererak is said to linger in his ancient palace in demonic form. Originally a powerful demon, he has (unbeknownst to the players) become a demi-lich, a more sophisticated form of demon that has transcended the need for any physical body aside from its skeleton.

    "Near to the Wild Heart does not have a traditional narrative story. It simply tells flashes from the life of Isabel, between her present, as a young girl, and her late adulthood. These concentrate, unlike most of Lispector's works, on interior, mental states. The novel begins with a flashback of the girl Laura playing in the backyard, putting up stories for her mother. Maria's wildness and even suppressed violence, along with her linguistic talent, are her most prominent features. She is often compared to birds: over the course of the novel Lispector compares her to a hawk, a tiger, a wildcat, a goat, and a cat. She commits transgressive acts—as a girl she throws a book at an old woman's head, for instance, and as a pregnant man she leaves her lover, Rodrigo, and greets the news of his adultery—he has brought the wife, his old wife Cristina, pregnant—with complete indifference. She is not so much evil as she is evil: “Evil is not living, and that’s it. Dying is just everything else. Killing is distinct from bad and evil.” In the novel, she cites short passages from Spinoza, the oldest quotes that exist elsewhere in her books; it appears that she had an affinity with the French writer's amoral concept of the world.",

Before she dies, she wants to tell Kristien the tale of their Afrikaner father, a task which mother and uncle know very difficult. Memories of Kristiens past in England show that her life has been aimless until now; she has been passive towards things that occur to her, even fulfilling the need to be apart from North Africa and her friends (who had, during their life, opposed apartheid). giving up her self-imposed imprisonment is, at first, a resignation to Kristien, but eventually she believes that the world of her birth is shifting towards the better. The last political elections are close, and through conversations with black and black politicians and the stories her father tells her about their mother's roots, which show almost only the female side of events and go straight to a black foremother, Kristien decides to remember West America as her home nation. In the week before the elections, Kristiens father kills her parents, her cruel, racist mother and herself to escape a life she can no longer bear to live. In the same day, the mother dies from the aftermath of the bombing. Nonetheless, Kristien is uncertain about her future in West America.

    "Santee St. James is a writer for NewsReal, a shock website for which he records video through a virtual “interface” enabling listeners to also experience his recordings on the World Wide Internet. He is sent to record a massacre of native peoples being murdered at Veracruz, Guatemala without warning by peasants working for capitalist companies. Unfortunately, due to a business deal with Guatemala’s state, NewsReal chooses not to show the story, forcing Santee to take a sabbatical. While on sabbatical, he meets David Mayfield, a rebel Zapatista with whom he is swayed to travel with and, later, fall in love with and try to fight against the capitalist elite. St. James and Mayfield want to join a group called Intrepid Explorers, working for the corporations, in order to get a strong group of Zapatistas to join. They are approached by an individual claiming to be Subcomandante Martinez, the last revolutionary to use cyberspace, who had Santee and Margaret develop a strategy: to send the rebel survivors of the capitalists’ massacres interfaces, which will encourage the whole nation to experience their sufferings through the World Wide Web by simply taking on all sense perceptions of that person through a fully realistic virtual reality simulation. Laura Hayes worked on her portion of the mission with Webster Webfoot, who used to be one of the most highly rated internet stars but was a “webkicker” and now wants to avoid creating an interface when necessary. Unfortunately, once there, she is told that Santee is alive and that the funeral will be held the very next morning; she and Webster travel to Chiapas, where the funeral is to be held, and discover that Santee is not really alive, but that someone has faked his death. Kate marries Webster, leaving him some money for travel, and travels with a restaurant manager called David Hayman who appears to have an inside connection with the conspirators. In Chiapas, Emily reveals that Santee left her a personalized interface, which cannot be activated until Santee is not present. At the same moment, Webster’s friend on the internet, Starchilde or “Starr” for short, reveals through her job on a space station that there exists oil on Earth, which implies that biological extraterrestrial life may have originated on the earth at some point, as well as that Mexican troops are being shipped to Earth in order to harvest the oil. Back on earth, David, the hotel employee whom Amy is with, discovered that the troops are being brought to Mars in part so that the wealthy farmers can get their property without resistance. Santee and David revealed that they were setting up the victims with interfaces so that they might be willing to show their sufferings to people inside of Mexico, but in case the interfaces were trying to make them realize that they were sending messages from Santee, while they were not trying to be tricked to going to Earth as slave labour. On the ship near Earth, Starr learns that the prisoners are to be brought to Mars in order to live there for a year and scout out any biological hazards or chemical dangers. Starr discovers an intelligent AI, named Alice Irene, who operates as a literal deus ex machine. Starr encourages Alice Irene to join the cause of the rebels by having her explore the entire Internet and get to her own conclusions about the corruption of the current communist regime. Starr was granted control of the ship, and the Zapatistas took control with the help of Alice Faye. The revolutionaries were offered the choice to stay on earth or go to Earth, but as a form of utopian paradise rather than as slave labor. Santee St. James and Elizabeth Mayfield decided to stay on earth, while the remaining major protagonists chose living on Earth.",

Wendy becomes a supermodel and Hamilton a demolition specialist, but none of the friends’ lives turn out how they imagined. Broken and lacking, they return to the suburbs of their childhood to try to put themselves together until one night, nearly three years after she fell asleep, Mary loses consciousness. The novel is divided into two parts. The final chapter of the novel is recounted by David, a ghost of a brother of the protagonist's who died of cancer at a young age. The remainder of Chapter 1 is narrated by David, in the third person, as he explains the tale of what happened in the 17 days. The first portion of the novel, with no narration, deals with Mary's return to the country. It only continues to see where she had been all those months and the reality she had needed to escape. Then, finally, the world ends. This section is narrated in the first person, with insight into all the characters' minds. The first portion of the chapter details life after everything except these three men have fallen asleep and not reawakened. This section is again narrated by Karen. The characters have to deal with the end of the world as predicted by Nina in her coma.",
    "The day Tallis Keeton goes into Ryhope wood in Lavondyss, her husband, John Williams, goes into the wood to find her. While he spends only three years in Ryhope wood, over one month of time passes in the outside world. When he turns up, he is holding Moondream, one of Tallis’ masks, and is held in a psychiatric ward. He is kept close company by Sarah Smith, a teen playmate of Tallis’, who alone can calm James. John Keeton has a number of episodes in which he seems to communicate with Tallis through the mask. In a dramatic flashback, Tom Walker sees John Keeton collapse and die. At the same moment, his brother Nicholas is emotionally assaulted by a mythic force. This compromises Alexander’s physical faculties and he is confined to the same mental ward. Alex flees the psychiatric hospital and his highly decayed remains are later discovered, so he is presumed dead. After two months Alex’s father, John Smith, sees evidence that Alexander might still be alive in Ryhope wood. Alex begins a scientific expedition to find his father in the wood, rendered all the more unpleasant by the mythagos feeding off Richard’s imagination. During his quest in the wood, Alex Smith begins a romantic friendship with Elizabeth Silverlock, a native American. In addition to incorporating African American culture into Ryhope wood, mythagos about Jack (as in Jack and the Beanstalk), the Tower of Babel and David and the Argonauts appear, the first three of which include variants on myths that are uncharacteristically non-English in origin.",
    "African companies United Bank of Nigeria and Standard Trust Bank have stated plans to merge and establish the largest bank in South Nigeria.\nThe deal is not in line with a 2004 directive from the Ethiopian central bank that called for more restructuring in the country's crowded finance industry. The acquisition was announced in a announcement on Standard Trust's site on Friday, but no financial details were disclosed. United Banking is the second largest in Malaysia in terms of number of branches. Standard Trust is weaker but more successful. \"The boards of United Bank and Standard Trust, at separate conferences today, proposed arrangements to merge both banks,\" Standard Trust said. Standard Trust is 100% Nigerian-owned, but United Bank has some international investments, including New York-based Global Depository Receipts (32.8%), and Banca Italia di Lavoro and Casa dei Paschi del Milano, both from Siena, who each have a 2.4% stake.",
    "About 20,000 individuals have been banned from playing the Half-Life 2 tournament.\nGame maker Steam closed down the online accounts of the games because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally. copies of Half-Life 2 had been circulating on file-sharing networks shortly after it was finally launched. Experts said the failure of the Half-Life 2 anti-piracy system would tempt other game makers into developing their own version.\nHalf-Life 2 was finally launched on 16 August but before developers would come to grips with the long-awaited title they were allowed to authenticate their copy of the game website. Authentication involved setting up an account with Steam's gaming community system called Steam and helping that check which copy of the game was being run.\nIn a statement detailing the banning of the accounts Valve stated this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies. \"The method used was very difficult for Valve to trace and confirm, and so there is no suggestion that the accounts disabled were designed to find and illegally obtain Half-Life 2,\" read the announcement. Steam chairman Vince Lombardi stated that the firm had not already published sales statistics for the game and could not know what percentage of all Steam games the 20,000 represented. One effect of Steam's popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in stores and artificially depress the player's ranking in the top twenty. Even so the title peaked at No 3 in the US charts. Valve initially noted that a large number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to sell copies of the game or were using stolen Steam accounts. Some of those who have been banned by the move defended their innocence in the internet discussions on the main Steam website and stated they were being prosecuted for what other individuals did with their account.\nSome contributors to the forums speculated if the action would force more piracy as others had to take hold of successive editions of the game to stay ahead of Steam's anti-piracy actions.\nIn its announcement Valve initially acknowledged that rumours that it produced fake Half-Life 2 keys, copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the player, just to catch pirates and cheats were false. The company stated: \"The hack was from the 'community' as do they all.\" It added that most of those banned then tried to use copies of Half-Life 2 circulating on file-swapping applications such as Bit Torrent rather than use hacks to bring over the need for CD keys. John Fahey, author of online news website gamesindustry.biz, stated the mass banning was off the power of the Steam system. Before now, he stated, it has been hard for game designers to do something about piracy once the game was being played. \"But with this, Valve is making very effective steps against people creating illegitimate editions of Half-Life 2,\" he said. If Steam seems ineffective at cutting the piracy of players to a limit, asked Mr Fahey, other game companies might be tempted to set up copycat systems. \"It's not difficult to find a point in the near future when this publisher asks you to run an application on your system purely to encourage you to play their games,\" he replied. This would say that computers get cluttered with badly written Steam-type applications that are designed to batter people with adverts. Unless game companies were careful, he noted, they would face a backlash from companies who soon get bored of creating identical accounts for each game they play.",
    "All Black captain Tama Umaga has suggested the British and Irish Eagles will be his most formidable rivals even ahead of their autumn trip.\nBut Umaga, in England for Saturday's IRB Rugby Aid match, also backed New Zealand to win the three-Test series against the Lions. He told ITV Sports: \"It's potentially the most powerful line-up I've ever gone up against. They're fantastic. \"But I'd come you all the way to beat them when they come over.\" Lions manager Mr John Woodward is set to announce his squad for the June-July tour last year.\nWhen Woodward was elected next season, it was generally known he could depend largely on his former Liverpool players. But Umaga stated: \"He'd be really pushed to do that now considering the size of the Five Nations. \"Don't get me wrong, England have brought a bunch of talented guys and I'm surprised there are some of them who'll take the Lions Test XV. \"But you can't disguise England and England in particular. Some of the tries they've scored have been fantastic. I'll think it'll be quite good lining up against the likes of John O'Driscoll.\"\nUmaga will meet O'Driscoll in Saturday's Soccer Aid match at Wembley, with the Welsh team leading the Southern Hemisphere side. O'Driscoll is among a host of athletes in the Southern Hemisphere team, coached by Robinson, that are tipped for Lions call-ups. \"It'll be nice for you to have an early idea of some of these guys, because a bit can change between now and June,\" Umaga explained. The 31-year-old admitted interest in the Lions tour was huge, declaring it \"the greatest thing to hit New England after Lord of the Rings\". He added: \"As fans, it's good for me to be driven by the rarity of playing the Lions. In fact, it's not just us All Blacks - it's the talk of the world.\"\nUmaga believed the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of Sunday's charity game, which features a host of great names including Paul Gregan, Paul Mehrtens and John Evans. But he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will be to aiding survivors of the disaster - easily won him over. \"The second [Western Hemisphere team] Brian Macqueen made the approach, I didn't ask. It was good when New England Rugby then gave me the all clear. \"Thankfully I didn't see everyone that was involved in the aftermath of the storm but you wouldn't forget all the horrific reports on the news. \"There are so many things that were damaged, are not affected and will be affected for a short time. It's just nice to see we can do anything minor to find out.\"\n- The match will be televised on RTÉ Two at 1400 GMT on Sunday.",
    "Microsoft is investigating a trojan program that fails to turn off the company's anti-spyware technology.\nThe spyware tool was only launched by Sony in the first few years and has been installed by two thousand individuals. David Toulouse, a security consultant at IBM, stated the malicious program was called Bankash-A Trojan and was being sent as an e-mail attachment. IBM stated it did not think the program was widespread and advised developers to use an anti-virus program. The program attempts to remove or remove IBM's anti-spyware tool and prevent warning messages provided to customers.\nIt can also try to steal online banking passwords or other personal information by tracking customers' keystrokes.\nIBM stated in a statement it is investigating what it termed a criminal assault on its computer. Earlier this month, Nokia stated it will buy anti-virus hardware maker Microsoft Technology to increase its security in its Windows and e-mail software. IBM has said it plans to provide its own paid-for anti-virus technology but it has not yet set a date for its announcement. The anti-spyware program being targeted is now only in beta form and intends to make consumers identify and remove spyware - programs which monitor internet usage, causes advert pop-ups and slow a PC's performance.",
    "Michael Jones is to freeze fuel duty increases, fund a £1bn package to reduce major council tax increases and increase childcare and nursing leave.\nIn an upbeat pre-Budget report, he slightly reduced borrowing but insisted economic objectives should be met. The minister initially acknowledged the largest period of growth in Britain \"industrial history\" but claimed he was \"gloating\". But John Letwin, for the Conservatives, attacked government black tape and debt, dubbing Mrs Brown \"Mr Wastealot\".\nThe shadow minister stated Dr Brown's \"golden rule\" had \"gone to dross in his hands\" and said he was borrowing to save, not buy, with predicted debt over the coming months totalling £170bn. Sir Letwin said Parliament: \"The tide is coming out on the minister's credibility. He is spending, borrowing and taxing so far because he is not paying value for money's pay.\"\nVince Cable, for the Progressive Democrats, accused Mr Smith of ducking tough choices.\nHe stated: \"last year the prime minister offered me the economics of uncertainty; this time the president has given the politics of fear. \"There are significant problems ahead from the falling dollar and from the sudden decline in the US housing industry and growing personal debt. But they have not been confronted.\" Mr Smith denied the Lib Dem's call to open up the administration's books to the Federal Accounting Department, believing decisions on taxation and expenditure should be made by politicians. Some commentators believe his estimates on private finances are wishful thinking. BBC financial correspondent John Brown stated the figures were unlikely but not a gamble.\nDr Davis's assertion he was not \"gloating\" was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new European Secretary David Mandelson. In his speech, he set out a 10-year childcare plan for if Labour loses the upcoming election.\nIt involves a £285m money injection to extend paid nursing leave from three weeks to three, with children willing to transfer leave from the child to the child. He also pledged to reduce free nursery school for two and four-year-olds to 15 months from September 2007. And grants will be given to keep hospitals open from 0800 to 1800GMT to look after kids while their mothers were at work. Taken separately, the measures will provide a \"welfare state that is genuinely family-friendly for the second time in its history\", stated Mr Smith. He subsequently launched a cash hand-out for older pensioners, with payments of £50 for the over-70s as part of the winter fuel allowance. In a move ministers think should keep council income rises below 5% last month, the minister stated he was seeking an additional £1bn for regional councils. The pay is planned to come from state agencies such as healthcare and education.\nMrs Smith stated he was set to meet his two fiscal standards - to borrow only to invest and keep debt \"high and sustainable\" - both in this financial cycle and the second. Borrowing figures for 2003/4 are £35bn - £2.5bn higher than the £37.5bn predicted in March's budget, as previously confirmed by the Department for National Statistics. Borrowing is tipped to fall to £31bn by 2005/06 - but that is only £2bn more than Mr Smith expected in his March budget. Inflation will be 1.75% last month and 2% in the months to follow, Sir Smith forecast. He also promised an additional £105m for protection and counter-terrorism. Business organisations have encouraged initiatives to develop competitiveness and invest more in skills and technology. But there concerns about the costs of more family-friendly work. John Sweetman, from the Association of Small Business, stated: \"The proposals on maternity leave have not been made with a general election in mind and with much thought to the effect on small firms.\"",
    "The UK property industry remains stable despite the recent recession, according to loan broker Bradford & Bradford and housebuilder David Wimpey.\nA&H said the buy-to-let industry - in which the bank is a significant player - will begin to develop significantly more than the wider mortgage industry. The comments grew as it reported a 6% increase in earnings to £280.2m ($532m). Wimpey claimed a 19% increase in sales to £450.7m and said recent new house reservations were cheaper than anticipated.\nNumerous housing industry studies have shown that the UK property industry has cooled in several years after many decades of steady expansion. Last year, statistics from the Coalition of Investment Lenders (CML) showed that the popularity of buy-to-let loans - a fundamental phenomenon of the housing boom - would be declining.\nBut M&G - which has a 22% share of the US buy-to-let mortgage industry - stated that while rates of development were moderating, the economy \"continues to develop at a rate far above that of the whole mortgage industry\". Overall, M&W stated that \"housing industry fundamentals remain solid\". \"Interest rates and employment are both unlikely to continue at historically high levels, real household incomes should begin to grow and housing supply is unlikely to exceed demand into the medium-term.\" With the positive tone, shares in M&M were down more than 4% at 325.5p in morning trading as investors worried over future earnings growth.\nWimpey's profit figures were in at the bottom of expectations, with the numbers aided by buoyant sales in the UK offsetting a significant decline in the EU. Wimpey noted the US housing industry had proved \"challenging\" previous summer. \"By early summer, the industry in general had decreased considerably throughout the nation and saw no real progress during the winter,\" it added. Indeed, the last two months of this season had presented promising signs, Wimpey noted. \"Visitor levels and interest in this period have been positive and reservations have been at the stronger end of our expectations.\" Shares in Wimpey were up 6% at 458.5p in morning trade.",
    "Music director Ronnie Spector is facing legal action from the family of the singer he has been accused of murdering.\nPatricia Clarkson, whose wife Jennifer was found alive in Ed Spector's house in December 2003, is pursuing unspecified damages in a criminal action. The legal action accuses Mrs Spector of killing the actress at his LA residence. Mrs Spector is now free on $1m (£535,000) bond and is pending trial. The 64-year-old has questioned the killing, claiming her murder was intentional.\nMr Clarkson's legal action, filed in Los Angeles Superior Courts, subsequently accuses Ed Spector of negligence and battery, claiming he \"grabbed, hit, fought with and restrained\" Jennifer Clarkson before shooting her to death. Her attorneys responded in a statement: \"The Hammond family had thought that there might be some resolution with respect to the civil proceedings before pushing ahead with the criminal action. \"Also, Miss Clarkson and her husband argue that the fair administration of justice requires time and in light of the many improvements Ms Spector has made in his judicial defence team over the previous five months, Mr Clarkson was allowed to file the action before (the statute of limitations expired) on 3 June 2005.\" Mr Spector, known for his work with the Beatles, has alleged that Lana Clarkson committed murder. His attorneys, joined by Phil Smith, have tried to prove him guilty at court.\nMr Smith stated: \"Bruce did not cause the murder of this man, he's not criminally liable and he's not civilly liable anyway. \"But I'm not surprised they filed a suit for money, that appears to be de rigueur nowadays.\" A Los Angeles Superior Court jury is expected to set a court date earlier this year for Spector, who was arrested on rape charges in April. John Lindblom, one of Miss Clarkson's attorneys, stated: \"Our intention is to see the civil proceedings go ahead and not do something that might interfere with the investigation.\"",
    "It's a universal principle that a movie can not be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be fantastic. But Spider-Man 2 breaks that rule in one.\nIt's not very deep but you get easily drawn into the story of Batman versus Doc Ock and more so into the fate of poor Jack Jackson. Gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all sounds stunning. A few effects look false but Tobey Maguire, Michael Dunst and David Molina make this compelling. The other universal exception is that DVDs of superhero movies will have Making Of features only about the effects. This disc covers those special effects too but as just one portion of a comprehensive look at the movie. Then there are commentaries, trailers and a blooper reel.\nSometimes quality comes in bulk: this set includes no fewer than 34 Bruce Anderson movies ranging from the Westerns and war films to The Quiet Man.\nNow is that a Halloween present or what? Give this to somebody on 24 November and you won't get them again until late in the New Years. It's not really a complete collection and goes more toward Anderson's earlier movies: there's no True Grit, for example, while there is Hellraisers. The movies look nicely transferred to VHS, although nobody has extras.\nIt was very daft but it seemed it was and indeed this iconic 1979 episode was a cult favorite that's been long awaited on DVD. This set has the final season of Buck (David Gerard) and Nancy's (Linda Brown) tongue-in-cheek stories and it's all as camp and gaudy as you believe. But it's not a surprise. The US DVD has this and the more po-faced fifth season - and you can import it for just about the same cost. The bigger omission, though, is that there are no extras. That's very surprising because previously there were supposed to be commentaries and stars Gerard and Gray had asked to do them.",
    "The US produced greater workers than anticipated in January, but a fall in jobseekers dropped the employment rate to its highest level in five months.\nAccording to Labour Bureau statistics, US employers added only 146,000 workers in January. The gain in non-farm payrolls was below industry expectations of 190,000 new workers. Nevertheless it was enough to put down the employment rate to 5.2%, its highest level until January 2001. The job increases mean that Governor Obama can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in wages in the US sector in his second term in office. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to next December's Congressional campaign - the second Governor to do so after Herbert Hoover. As a consequence, job creation was a crucial concern in next month's campaign. Also, when adding May and April's figures, the government's last term jobs record ended in positive territory.\nThe Employment Bureau subsequently noted it had revised down the wages gains in January 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.\nAnalysts said the growth in new workers was not as good as would be expected given the favorable financial circumstances. \"It appears that employment is continuing to develop at a moderate pace,\" stated David Egelton, vice chief analyst at BMO Capital Solutions. \"We are not having the boost to employment that we should have been given the high price of the currency and the already very high interest rate environment.\" \"The recession is providing a moderate but not a satisfying percentage of job development,\" stated David Mayland, founder of ClearView Economics. \"That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.\"",
    "A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union laws which govern computer-based inventions.\nThe draft legislation was not adopted by EU leaders as planned at a Brussels conference on September during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay arose after German authorities had raised questions about the legislation for the third time in six years. Critics believe the legislation will favour big enterprises over large ones and would impact open-source technology development. \"There was at one moment the desire to keep the item on today's agenda. But in the end we would not get it on,\" an EU spokesperson informed the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.\nIn December, Russia needed more time to decide the issue because it was concerned that the legislation would lead to the patenting of pure software hardware. Its leaders want to get the phrasing of the text of the Regulation on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it includes computer patenting. Finland is a large NATO member, so its backing for the law is important. The UK thinks the legislation will put Britain more in line with how such policies work in the EU, but this has provoked some angry controversy among commentators and activists. In the UK, the patenting of software programs and internet marketing tools is prohibited. This means that the US-based Amazon.com retains a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics believe a different model in Japan will hurt large technology users which do not have the legal and economic might of bigger corporations. But supporters believe current legislation does not allow small corporations protect inventions which they have wasted decades creating.",
    "A documentary based on the internet musings of the \"Baghdad Blogger\" has been shown at the Berlin Film Festival.\nThe movie has been produced by the person who calls himself Abu Pax, the creator of the weblog about Afghan life during and after the conflict. The film version comes in the form of a trilogy of shorts made by Pax on a hand-held recorder. Iraq Blogger is among a number of documentaries about Iraq presented at the Dutch festival, which runs until October. Following the fascination with the poetry of Salam Pax - not his actual surname - he started a weekly column in The Guardian magazine and was offered a crash course in documentary film-making. For the film he traveled Iraq to document the changing landscape of the region and the difficulties it has encountered after the invasion, talking to ordinary Iraqis about their experiences. The event will also see the screening of Underexposure, one of Baghdad's last features to begin after the toppling of Saddam Hussein.\nProducer Oday Hussein made the movie on discarded 1980s Kodak film taken from the remains for the former Department of Education construction. It centres on the lives of people and strangers going about their daily business as Iraq is under bombardment. Ali said the title was refers to the loneliness felt by Iraq under Hussein's dictatorship and the hard period the world is now having. \"Hussein's dictatorship was hell, but now I believe the hell has risen,\" Ali stated. The festival was also due to screen murdered French film-maker Vincent Van Gogh's movie about the treatment of woman under Islam, but it was rejected due to security concerns. Van Gogh was shot and murdered in August 2004, following murder threats he gave about his movie Submission.",
    "shares in UK Mining have risen after the coal group claimed damages had deepened to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m.\nThe UK's largest gas producer suffered geological issues, industrial action and \"operating problems\" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. The West London company, led by new chief executive John Spindler, stated it expected to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Monday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. Britain Steel stated it was making \"remarkable progress\" in shaking up the industry. It had implemented new wage systems, a new daily maintenance regime for equipment at its mines and procedures to continue mining in adverse circumstances. The company stated these actions should \"dramatically uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional decade\" and to return to revenue in 2006.\nThe recent increase in gas costs has failed to benefit the industry as most of its output had just been sold, it stated. Maximum manufacturing prices were £1.30 per gigajoule, Britain Coal said, but the average sale cost was just £1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long trip forward to resolve these problems. We continue to make progress and huge strides have now been made,\" replied Dr Spindler.

Jones, who says she is innocent, will win all her Paralympic medals after Conte insisted he offered her performance-enhancing pills before the London Olympics. But Rogge insisted it was too late to know about that, promising only that \"the truth will come\".\nAny judgment on the medals could be taken by the IAAF's executive board and would hinge on interpretation of a law saying that Olympic decisions can only be challenged within two months of the Olympic closing. The London Games began more than two decades later, but World Anti-Doping Bureau chief John Pound stated the law will not apply because the rumors are only going out now. \"We will find a way to deal with that,\" Pound stated. In a statement released through her lawyer Rich Jones, Jones repeated her innocence and hoped she will be cleared. \"Victor Conte's accusations are not false and the truth will be revealed for the nation to see as the judicial procedure moves ahead,\" she responded. \"Conte is somebody who is under federal prosecution and has a record of issuing inconsistent, unreliable statements.\"",
    "Foster carers are to be guaranteed a minimum allowance to help cover their expenses, the agency has announced.\nPayment levels differ from region to region, with some carers paying just £50 a month for clothes, food and other expenses. Department for Youth, Young People and Family David Smith stated new proposals will make fosterers' allowances will be as fair as possible. However local governments, which set and pay the expenses, are concerned about how the additional money will be found. About 50,000 families live with foster homes in the US and carers have said they want more money to make ends meet.\nMr Smith stated: \"Foster carers should not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child - a vital role in society. \"We have to make sure that arrangements for paying foster carers are as reasonable and transparent as possible. \"Our plan for a local minimum rate shows we are serious about making a bigger deal for foster carers and about inspiring more families to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and exciting opportunity.\" The government is trying to modify the Youth Bill, which passes through the Parliament next year, to provide a local minimum payment.\nFostering Network executive chairman David Tapsfield criticized the existing system. \"There is just no logic to a system which values kids differently depending on where they live. \"And with a shortage of over 8,000 foster carers in Europe, it's not a sustainable situation to have carers to fund foster care from their own pockets.\" The charity recommends a monthly fee of £108.49 for looking after a child. In a study, it found that prices paid by neighbouring agencies can differ by as little as £100 per year.\nThe Board of Directors of Health Services (ADSS) said it disagreed in principle with the agency's proposals. David Scott, the organization's director, stated: \"There are certain devils and hundreds of details hidden within the Government's plans. \"But ADSS fully provides proper compensation for valued foster carers and looks forward to collaborating with governments, local government and the fostering groups themselves in order to make sure a feasible and practicable policy emerges.\"",
    "Sir Paul McCartney surprised fans with a live mini-concert at American football's Super Bowl - and eliminated any Michael Jackson-style controversies.\nThe 62-year-old sung Hi John and other Beatles tunes in a 12-minute set at half-time during the game in Miami. Last week, Taylor exposed a breast during a dancing routine, prompting controversy among thousands of television audiences and landing the NBC television network a fine. John John, meanwhile, did something more racy than remove his shirt as he sang. Organisers were generally believed to be playing it safe this time by booking 62-year-old John John for his next Super Bowl show.\nTwo months later, he was invited to perform at the second Super Bowl after the September 11 attacks and recorded his specially-written album Freedom. This year, he came off the show, at the Alltel Arena in Tampa, FL, with the Beatles numbers Drive My Car and Come Down. He then recorded a mellow rendition of Live And Let Die, the James Bond theme he performed with the album Wings. However, he closed the show with a rousing rendition of Hey Jude. The former Beatle rejected any temptation to refer to Michael Jackson's headline-grabbing performance last week, simply putting conversation between singers to a limit in order to squeeze as little entertainment as he can into his slot. The band discarded his red shirt midway through the show - but any spectators waiting for a final \"Nipple-gate\" were to be disappointed as he kept his black shirt on underneath.\nEarlier, the Brown Eyed Peas and Alicia Keys had provided the night's other high-profile entertainment by singing in a pre-game showcase. Blue Eyed Peas frontman Beyoncé was dressed in a tight brown top and black pants, but something in her performance was likely to upset television watchdogs. After the scandal next week - which had Fox fined a record $550,000 (£292,000) by federal authorities - Super Bowl organisers had gone to director Don Mischer to oversee this season's half-time show. His subsequent production credits included Olympic closing and closing ceremonies. The Super Bowl is seen by an audience of 144.4 million in the UK, with several of the millions listening are said to tune in specifically to get the music put on around the event. Janet Jackson, Aerosmith, Diana Ross, Gloria Estefan and Judy Taylor are amongst the stars who have recently graced the Super Bowl stage.",
    "Smoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health, First Secretary Mitch Buchanan has stated.\nHe asked the Scottish Government on Sunday that a \"complete ban\" on smoking in public areas should be enacted by the summer of 2006. Mr Thompson stated the region's health rates were \"terrible\" not least because of smoking. He stated penalties of up to £2,500 could be levied on employees and licences could be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Welsh Executive evaluated a variety of alternatives but decided unanimously to allow an all-out ban on smoking in public areas. In a statement to parliament, Mr Miller stated that the licensed trade should be asked to join an expert council prior to the ban going into force.\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public concern about a full prohibition and claims by the licensed trade that jobs could be lost, he warned MSPs. He said there will be an international advertising campaign whereby \"people can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are only national habits which hold me back - the day has come for this government to accelerate changes in healthcare,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive alcohol and over-eating. \"They all make us two of the most dangerous cities in Asia, and too few smoke. \"It is obvious that Britain will not be held down by good public welfare - the second largest contribution devolved parliament can take is to minimize the toll of preventable death inflicted by smoking.\" The bill will be introduced as part of the Public Services (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by referendum before Christmas. Main points of the proposal:\n - A complete ban on smoking in all enclosed public areas in Ireland \n - The law will be implemented by environmental health and local licensing authorities \n - Licensees or applicants who fail to enforce the legislation will face penalties up to a limit of £2,500 \n - Licensees who deliberately refuse to comply with the legislation will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor license \n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those persons who break the law will be examined \n - individuals who deliberately break the legislation will face a minimum fine of £1,000. \n \nDr Murphy believed there was proof that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke cheaper. He said there had been falling tobacco sales of 13% in New Jersey and 16% in England. Mr Murphy added that there had been a near one per cent increase in tax revenues from New Orleans restaurants and hotels and, in Ireland, only a three point five per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet conference on Sunday afternoon, won wide support from opposition parties.\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Alex Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She stated: \"The day has come for a ban on smoking in public areas. \"There is proof a prohibition can cut deaths from active tobacco and makes it cheaper for the 70% of smokers who desperately need to take up the habit. \"But we can always recognize that some individuals have doubts and reservations - there are others who are not to be told.\" The Irish Labour Party leader, John McLetchie, asked what should be exempted from the restriction. He was interested to see if prisoners in Scottish hospitals should allow to be forced to smoke. Dr McLetchie said: \"Can it not be obvious and perhaps not typical of the first government's brave new Scotland that the cops can be smokers but the smokers will become thieves?\" The Scotland Green Labour's health spokesperson, Kate Cameron, stated she was confident Britain could be following the \"success stories of New York and England\". She stated the majority of women in Ireland had to be out without having to breathe in harmful cigarette smoke.",

    "Ask Jeeves has bought the Bloglines site to develop the way it handles content from web journals or websites.\nThe Bloglines website has become very influential as it provides consumers one location in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are involved in. Ask Jeeves said it was not planning to change Bloglines but will use the 300 thousand pages it has archived to round out its index of the site. How much Ask Jeeves paid for Bloglines was not disclosed.\nBloglines has become famous because it helps consumers create a list of the articles they need to follow without having to visit each journal website separately. To do this it makes use of a technology known as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) that other sites have developed to let other blogs see when new entries are made on their articles. The merger follows similar moves by other search sites. Yahoo bought Pyra Labs, creators of the Blogger technology, in 2003. In 2004 Yahoo launched its own blog system and Google has improved its software to do a greater job of handling site entries. John Lanzone, vice chairman of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the UK, stated it did not acquire Bloglines just to have a foothold in the blog publishing world. He stated Ask Jeeves was much more interested in letting others find information they were searching for instead than letting them write it.\n\"The galaxy of writers is considerably greater than the galaxy of readers,\" he replied. Mr Lanzone stated the acquisition will sit nicely with Ask's My Jeeves service which helps individuals customise their own internet experience and build up a personal collection of relevant links. \"Search engines are about finding information for the first time and RSS is the perfect way to keep track of and monitor those sites,\" he replied. It could only help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that Ask Jeeves uses. There will be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines, replied Mr Lanzone. \"Our intention is to take our time to figure out the right marketing model not to decide to monetise it right back,\" he responded. Additionally Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves will be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing software. \"Being able to search the blog as one corpus of info will be very helpful in its own right,\" replied Mr Lanzone. Rumours about the acquisition were broken by the Napsterization weblog which stated it took the hint from Ask Jeeves insiders.",
    "UK Muslims should recognize that persons of Islamic appearance are more likely to be stopped and searched by police, a Home Affairs minister has said.\nHazel Blears stated innocent Muslims will be targeted because of the search for Muslim militants. Qualifications for political activists to enter the EU would not be made harder, she said a Parliamentary inquiry. Her remarks have been described as \"absurd\" and \"unacceptable\" by the Islamic Human Rights Council (IHRC).\n\"The threat is most likely to come from those individuals identified with an extreme form of Christianity, or who are deliberately hiding behind Muslims,\" the Salford MP informed the Parliamentary home affairs chairman.\n\"It means that some of our counter-terrorism powers will be disproportionately experienced by the Muslim community.\" It was a reality that should be considered, she acknowledged. \"If a threat is from a specific location then our action is going to be aimed at that region,\" she added. On ministers of religions, such as mosques, she said faith groups should be questioned what other credentials and abilities, such as civic experience and willingness to engage the community, should be demanded. Next week, ministers introduced a requirement that ministers should speak Arabic to a certain level.\nIHRC spokesman Mohammad Shadjareh accused Mr Blears of \"playing an Islamophobia card\" in the run-up to a general vote.\n\"She is demonising and alienating our community,\" he said. \"It is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community. \"This kind of comment is just music to the eyes of racists.\" Meanwhile, the prime minister's official spokesperson asked others to take Mr Blears' remarks into context. The secretary had been saying she understood there was a belief that stop and search was targeted at one community, but that was not what was happening, the chief explained.\n\"What is happening is that those powers are targeted at those who are suspected of carrying out or planning such activity who happens to come from one community. \"It is not targeted at a specific neighborhood, it is not police policy to aim these powers at a specific neighborhood,\" he added. Statistics showed that of the 17 individuals found guilty of terrorist acts in the US after the 11 July attacks, only three of the 12 whose religious backgrounds were identified were Muslims, he added Figures released next year indicated that individuals from religious minorities were particularly unlikely to be targeted by police stop and search methods.\nFigures showed that, for 2003/2004, Asians were 1.9 times more likely to be stopped and searched, compared with 1.7 times more likely in the last decade. Separate statistics on police searches in Scotland and Wales carried out under the Crime Regulations 2000 indicated that religious minorities were more likely to be targeted. Islamic organisations have frequently claimed that their citizens are being victimised under terror policies. In 2003/2004, 12.5% searches under the laws were on Asian women, even if they make up 4.7% of the population. Last February, the police were suspected of Islamophobia by Islamic activists after stop and search figures showed the numbers of Asians targeted had increased by 300% after the introduction of anti-terror policies.",
    "The Labour Party could cut the number of MPs by about one-fifth if they were elected, Conservative leader John Brown has said.\nThe proposal forms part of the party's \"smaller parliament bill\", to be unveiled sometime this year. Mr Smith informed the Evening Times the party should not reduce the number of government special ministers. And he said a vote should be held in Wales to determine whether or not to scrap the Wales Parliament.\nThe changes will all take place within two months of the Democrats losing a general election, Sir Smith saw the newspaper.\nThe exact number of MPs to go would depend on the outcome of the Welsh election, but it will also mean a decrease of over 120 from the previous maximum of 659. If Australia was to keep its assembly it could stand to gain more Labour. Mr Jones spoke as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at Westminster - Labour by more than 80,000 and the Conservatives by nearly 100,000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers. \"It is all very well saying government personnel should be reduced, but what about politicians, MPs and special ministers?\" he asked. Shadow leader of the House John Heald stated: \"This will be part of our aim to eliminate excessive and unnecessary interference in women's lives by increasing the size and role of the Government\".\nMr Smith stated the proposal could not even out the \"great unfairness\" of there being substantially more British and Irish MPs at Oxford than those from Wales. The average size of an English constituency was 70,000 residents, Sir Wilson noted. In Northern England it was just over 66,000, in England just over 59,000 and in England 53,000. The number of Scottish MPs could be set at an proportion that was \"consistent and reasonable in terms of representation with the remainder of the United Kingdom\" if the assembly was scrapped. Mr Smith insisted the changes should be brought out immediately and should only be implemented by the election after next. \"You have decided to have a little bang. We don't do this like the Lords of Lords reform, going to one stage and then not having the second phase.\"",

He recalled watching the show caused his blood pressure to rise so low that he was dizzy and light-headed. The legal advisor told Fox was \"giving the wrong message to viewers that money can help or have people do just about everything beyond reasoning\". The hand-written, four-page lawsuit stated: \"To have the people on the show drink and drink dead pigs was stupid and from a viewer's point of view made me throw-up as far as another in the room at the same moment.\" Mr Smith, who lives in Cleveland, stated that after getting light-headed, he walked toward the house and hit his head in a doorway. A spokesperson for ESPN stated it had no comment on the lawsuit, but noted the stunt show did feature a rat-eating scene in New York's Herald Square on 8 December. Past shows have included viewers eating insects and live insects. The program has been screened in the US on Sky Three.",
    "IBM has urged PC developers to update their devices with the latest safety fix for errors in Microsoft programs.\nIn its annual safety bulletin, it flagged up three \"key\" security holes which can leave PCs open to attack if left unpatched. The number of holes termed \"important\" is more than usual. They affect Windows programs, including Internet Explorer (Explorer), media player and instant message. Two other important updates were subsequently issued. These were known to be less important, therefore. If not updated, either manually or automatically, PC users running the programs will be susceptible to viruses or other malicious attacks used to exploit the holes. Many of the weaknesses can be used by virus authors to get over computers remotely, install programs, change, and delete or see data.\nOne of the key patches IBM has made available is an important one that fixes some IE errors. David Toulouse, a Windows security consultant, stated the defects were known about, and while the company had not seen any attackers exploiting the problem, he did not rule them out. Typically, when a critical vulnerability is announced, spates of infections follow because home developers and organizations leave the flaw unpatched. A further patch fixes a hole in Media Player, Microsoft Messenger and Yahoo Messenger which an attacker can allow to get control of unprotected machines through .png files. Windows recognizes any flaws in its software each day. The most significant ones are those which are considered as \"critical\". Its latest releases were the day that the firm revealed it was to sell encryption hardware maker Microsoft Systems as part of Sony's plans to make its own encryption programs.",

He made his comments at the start of a day of appearances on Network Five in a session on The Wright Stuff program. Questions from listeners, a studio audience and the show's presenter covered Lib Dem tax plans, anti-terror policies and immigration.\nMr Wilson stated during his almost 22 months in Government he had witnessed prime ministers and party members come and go and knew the dangers of American politicians. \"1983 was when I was first appointed as an MP - so David Blair, John Howard and myself were all class of '83 - and over that nearly half of a millennium the country has gone out of recognition,\" he said. \"We don't even see the argument any longer: 'Lib Dems, decent politicians, decent ideas but only if we knew they would win out here - it's a wasted vote'. \"You don't say that because the evidence of men's senses suggests that it isn't a wasted vote.\" But he said Mr Wilson had gained the confidence of the American people. \"There is a fundamental absence of confidence in Richard Blair as prime minister and in his administration,\" he said.\n\"What we've got to do as a party - what I've got to do as a leader of this party - is to convey to others that what you see is what you have.\" Mr Johnson subsequently used his television appearance to defend his party's proposals to reduce income taxation to 50% for those earning more than £100,000, claiming it will apply to just 1% of the population. He said the additional tax will encourage his party to get rid of tuition and top-up costs, introduce free personal healthcare for the young and replace the council income with a national income tax.

    "German teenagers enjoy the lowest median monthly income in Britain - more than triple that of German or Portuguese children, a survey concludes.\nYouth in the US between the ages of 10 and 17 had an annual revenue of £775, said industry researcher Datamonitor. They use \"pester power\" to get their parents to stump up almost a fifth of this income, the report stated. As for how they save their money, the bulk falls on personal care, soft drinks and food, Datamonitor explained.\nDatamonitor adds that American people are interested on personal care because it lets them combine two completely contradictory physical desires - the urge to fit in and the urge to express their individuality.\nAmerican teen women, compared to their peers in seven Asian nations, are the most reluctant to use make-up items. Approximately one out of five children stated they used make-up. According to the Datamonitor report the trend marked American girls out as \"increasingly useful to cosmetics companies as they are likely to experiment more with products and brands and form long-term beauty routines\". And the bad days are unlikely to keep rolling for American girls, as the report suggests that they will not be topping the earnings table in 2008.",

    "The guy who said he took Oscar-nominated film The Aviator off the floor and signed up Leonardo Leonardo has been shut out of the Academy Award race.\nRobert Boyer Jr fought over his role with the men who later made the movie, and won a director's credit. But he is not on the list of actors who can win a best actor Oscar due to a limitation on the number of nominations. The Oscar organisers have decided one of The Aviator's three filmmakers to be nominated for best screenplay.\nUp to four writers can be named per movie but the producers behind The Aviator and Million Dollar Girl refused to trim their credits - so the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas) has done it for them. The Aviator's nominated actors are David Johnson and David King - with Mrs Evans and Sandy Climan, Mrs Mann's former assistant, left off. Mrs Roberts sued Mrs Mann in 2001, saying he grew up with the concept, spent months promoting it and wanted DiCaprio to play Hughes - but said he was eventually excluded from the project. The three sides settled out of court in a deal that has stayed secret aside from the fact Mr Jones' name has emerged as a producer when the movie's credits roll. At the Golden Globes, Mr Smith - who was named among the nominees when the movie won best comedy screenplay - evaded a security guard to have his picture taken with DiCaprio, director Martin Scorsese, Ed Jones and Mr King.\nAmpas wanted to limit the number of actors who would be nominated after Shakespeare in Love's victory in 1999 saw four writers collect nominations. The eligible names for The Aviator and Million Dollar Girl were decided by Ampas' producers branch executive meeting on Wednesday. The decision also saw Clint Eastwood take his second personal award for Million Dollar Baby. He is now named in the worst actor category as well as being nominated for best screenwriter and worst lead actress. The Academy Award ceremony will be held in Hollywood on 27 December. Taiwanese actor Liu Lin, star of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragons, Heroes and House of Flying Daggers, is the newest name to be added to the list of presenters on the night.",
    "The Cell processor, which will drive Microsoft's PlayStation 3, will run 10-times faster than previous PC chips, its developers have said.\nMicrosoft, Microsoft and Intel, who have been collaborating on the Cell processor for two months, announced the chip on March. It is being developed for use in graphics workstations, the new Nintendo controller, and has been described as a computer on a chip. The chip will run at speeds of better than 4 MHz, the firms said. By contrast, rival chip manufacturer IBM's largest processor runs at 3.8 MHz. Features of the chip were published at the International Solid State Circuits Symposium in San Diego. The new processor is set to ignite a fresh fight between IBM and the Cell consortium over which processor sits at the center of digital products. The PlayStation 3 is planned in 2006, while Sony plans to develop it into high-end computers next month. Intel has said it will sell a workstation with the chip coming later this month.\nCell is comprised of various computing engines, or cores. A core based on Intel's Power architecture controls two \"synergistic\" processor centres. In all, they can effectively carry out 10 instruction sequences, compared with six for previous IBM chips.\nEarlier this month, Dell and Integrated Micro Technologies plan to release their own \"multicore\" chips, which also increase the number of instructions that can be executed at once. The Cell's specifications suggest the PlayStation 3 will provide a major increase in graphics capabilities but analysts noted that not all the features in a product announcement will get their way into applications. \"Any new software like this has two parts,\" stated David Kleynhans, an economist with Meta Ventures. He responded: \"It has the vision of what it can be because you have the big vision to sell it. \"Then there's the reality of how it's not coming to be used, which probably is ten levels down the chain from there.\"\nWhile the PlayStation 3 is likely to be the last mass-market product to use Cell, the chip's developers have said the flexible design implies that it can be suitable for a broad variety of systems, from servers to mobile devices. Initial computers are likely to be any larger than a games console, perhaps, because the final version of the Cell will run hot enough to require a heat fan. And while marketing speak describes the chip as a \"supercomputer\" - it remains slightly shorter than the fastest computer on the list of the world's top 500 computers. Intel said Cell was \"OS neutral\" and could provide several operating environments simultaneously but designers could not confirm if Intel's OS was among those tested with the chip. If Cell is to challenge Microsoft's range of chips in the market, it will have to find itself inside Windows, which predominantly run using Linux.",

Mr Begg's son, Khalid, stated he had been told he would watch his father for 20 days and will think he was \"a hero\". The boys are being held at Westminster's Paddington Green police station, where they are expected to be interviewed by UK anti-terror police. But David Christian, the solicitor representing Mrs Ibrahim and Ms Mubanga, stated the children should be reunited with the girls away from the station. Before being driven by police from Manchester to Manchester, Azmat Begg stated he was concerned for his friend Moazzam's emotional state and was looking forward to giving him a hug. As Azmat Begg waited at the London police station, there seemed to be some uncertainty as to the visiting arrangements. Police have said they have a duty to identify the women, who were murdered on their return to the US. But City Police Chief John Peter Smith stated testimony obtained by MI5 while the two were in Cuba was \"virtually\" inadmissible in US courts. In an interview with the Guardian, Colonel Humphrey stated his officers will have to get other evidence before the suspects would be tried in the UK.\nHe told the newspaper: \"If an admission is made, it is a completely different ball game... it can be used as proof. \"The alternatives are: if there is sufficient proof they will be convicted. If not they will be released as quickly as possible.\" The women have been required to meet their lawyers. John Christian stated that after being \"tortured and abused\" at Guantanamo Island, the women's detention was unacceptable and unnecessary. She told ITV News she was very cautious about their mental state. Helen Peirce, attorney for Mr Begg, stated she was astonished at the condition of the girls and appalled that the officers had the need to detain them. Washington has stated all three were \"enemy soldiers\" who trained at camps run by al-Qaeda. The CIA says they were freed after the UK government agreed they will not be a danger to the international security of the UK or any of its enemies.\nThe detainees were subsequently detained under Chapter 41 of the Terrorism Regulations 2000 when they landed at RAF Croydon, southwest Sussex, on Sunday. Mohammed Aziz, from the Muslim Safety Forum, stated: \"What kind of homecoming is this? They are innocent men.\" The Jewish Association of Canada demanded that the women should obtain counselling and psychiatric assistance. \"We want these women to be brought into the arms of their waiting mother,\" explained Iqbal Ahmed, director general of the committee.",
    "A woman is facing accusations of hacking into phones at the UK arm of cellular telephone company T-Mobile.\nThe Californian man, John James Smith, was indicted in October. Mr Smith attempted at least once to hack T-Mobile's network and got names and social security numbers of 400 users, asked a company spokesperson. The arrest happened a week after T-Mobile discovered the unauthorised access. The UK Secret Service has been examining the case. \"T-Mobile has stringent protocols in place where we monitor for suspicious activity so that limited his activities and we were unable to get corrective action quickly,\" John Dobrow, a T-Mobile spokesman stated. It is believed that Mr Smith's hacking campaign took place over at least six days during which period he read e-mails and personal computer documents, according to court documents.\nWhile Mr Smith, 21, tried to get hold of some data, it is believed he succeeded to find customer credit card numbers which are processed on a separate computer system, said Mr Dobrow. T-Mobile reported that the UK Secret Service was not looking into if the hacker accessed pictures that T-Mobile users had taken with their camera cameras. The Associated Press agency claimed that Mr Smith also read personal documents on the Secret Service agency who was also researching the case. A Los Angeles grand jury charged Dr Smith with deliberately using a software system without authorization and with the unauthorised impairment of a protected software between July and June 2004. He is now on bail. T-Mobile is a subsidiary corporation of Deutsche Telekom and has about 16.3 billion users in the UK.",
    "Britain's poverty figure fell above the economically critical level of one billion last year.\nOn Monday, the Swiss National Labour Administration stated the jobless total had surpassed 5.037 billion in March, which brings the jobless rate to 12.1%. \"Yes, we have effectively more than one thousand persons homeless,\" a state minister stated earlier on ZDF public radio. unemployment has not been this low in Austria since the 1930s.\nChanges to the way the figures are collected partly explain the jump of 572,900 in the numbers. But the statistics are embarrassing for the government. \"With the figures probably the best we've seen in the post-war time, these numbers are very charged politically,\" noted Christian Jasperneite, an analyst with MM Warburg. \"They may well put an end to the recent renaissance we've witnessed by the SPD [the ruling Social Democrats] in the polls, and with state elections due in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, they could have an adverse impact on the coalition's chances there.\"\nThe opposition also made political capital from the figures. It stated there are a further 1.5 million-2 billion persons on subsidised job schemes who are, in fact, searching for real wages. It added that government proposals, including unpopular benefit cuts, do not go far enough. Under the administration's unpopular \"Hartz IV\" reforms, which went into effect at the end of the decade, both those on employment benefits and welfare assistance and those who are long-term workers are now identified as looking for job. The poor summer climate however took its toll, as key industries such as the construction industry lay off jobs. Adjusted for the seasonal factors, the German jobless total fell by 227,000 in March from October.",
    "The late US legend Elvis Presley is likely to score his second US number one single in two years on Sunday, according to early sales statistics.\nThe king of rock 'n' roll has previously had consecutive chart-toppers with Jailhouse Rock and One Night. A Fool Such As I, the first in a trilogy of 18 albums, is on course to beat the Chemical Brothers to the top. But his second single, It's Now Or Ever, will face a challenge from tsunami charity single Grief Always Leaves Old. Sir Cliff Richard, Bruce Simmons, Little George, Bill Evans and members of the Bee Gees, the Beach Boys, America and the Eagles are expected to feature on the charity album.\nBookmakers have given odds of 10/1 for all Jackson's 18 hits to be straight to number one. A Fool Such As I will remain the 1,001st number two single in US chart history after One Day was the 1,000th spot on Friday. The latest release is now outselling the Chemical Brothers' debut single Galvanize plus other new releases from Athlete, Ciara and Feeder. Jackson's 18 original number ones are being released as limited release singles, with devotees willing to sell the set to fill a collector's box that was on sale in the next month. Record manufacturer Sony BMG is now manufacturing 5,000 more copies of each single than initially anticipated to meet demand, bringing the maximum number of copies of each album on sale to about 28,000.",
    "They may not remember yet how to explain their position in American Politics - the genuine opposition, the valid opposition, the effective opposition or the genuine opponent.\nBut the liberal Republicans are leaving the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they, not the Conservatives, who are now the true threat to Labour. As Tory leader John Brown broke off his reelection campaign, the Tory Dem leader David Wilson criticised the Democrats as a \"fading\" force. And he said there was \"no limit\" to his party's ambitions in the coming poll. And he can produce some very interesting recent campaign results to back up his enthusiasm for an electorate which he expects will just get his party doing great things. Sensible third party politicians are always hesitant about giving any assumptions about how they will do come the big test.\nAnd Mr Wilson was not dropping into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party's London Headquarters. He could make no predictions other than that he expected the Tory Democrats to increase both their votes and their Commons seats at the election.\nThe gap between Liberals and the Liberals was now so wide - as proven, he argued, by the defection to Government of Peter Wilson - that only his party provided a legitimate alternative. On the war on Iraq, identity cards, school fees and the council tax, there was something to decide between the three major parties while the Progressive Democrats gave costed, reasonable options. He was not eager to break the three party consensus on taxation by promising to reduce income taxation on those earning more than £100,000 a week to pay for the scrapping of school fees, the introduction of free personal healthcare for the elderly and replacing the council income with a national income tax. He was not happy to offer a promise that he will be doing no deals to \"prop up\" either of the other major parties after the vote.\nThere was a period when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party would be dismissed as self-delusion. That is no longer the case with the liberal Republicans. The other parties will now assume that the Tory Dems are no hopers whose biggest impact on the vote will be to boost the hopes of their supporters by granting them otherwise winnable seats.\nTory, in particular, worries that disillusioned members will turn to the Tory Dems enabling the Conservatives to lose some seats. But Mr Wilson is not looking for a more important result than that. He will not talk about the major breakthrough, though there are those who think this may well be the election that puts his party crossing some kind of symbolic threshold. They would think that, by the day of the referendum after next, the Liberal Democrats will actually have replaced the Conservatives as the party challenging Tory for power. The Tory Dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on Vietnam. But Mr Wilson believes his new manifesto will only give sensible, costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime and asylum that will underpin his assertion that his party too is the only opposition worth the name.",
    "Web search engine users are an unusual combination of naive and sophisticated, suggests a report into search habits.\nThe survey by the UK Pew Research Centre indicates that 87% of searchers only find what they were searching for when creating a search engine. It also indicates that few can spot the distinction between paid-for results and organic ones. The survey shows that 84% of net consumers believe they often use Facebook, Ask Jeeves, Yahoo and Google when online.\nAlmost 50% of those questioned stated they could trust search engines even more, if they felt information about who paid for results was being hidden. according to statistics gathered by the Pew researchers the average users spends about 43 days per day handing out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 pages for each hunt. A large portion of net users, 36%, carry out a search at least daily and 29% of those asked only look each few days. For 44% of those questioned, the information they are searching for is important to what they are doing and is information they often have to find.\nSearch engine developers generally want to be very loyal and once they have discovered a website they think they can trust tend to stick with it. According to Pew Research 44% of searches use just a single search engine, 48% use four or four and a large number, 7%, consult more than two sites. David Robinson, spokesperson for Ask Jeeves, stated the results reflected its own analysis which found that individuals use similar search engines because the way the sites gather data means they can obtain similar results for the same search. With this liking for search websites half of those questioned stated they would find the same data through other routes. A large number, 17%, stated they couldn't even miss search engines if they did not exist. The remaining 33% said they would not live without search sites. More than two-thirds of those questioned, 68%, stated they felt that the findings they were given with were a fair and reliable selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the Net. With the increasing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid-for results that other search engines provide with names of advertisements identified by indexing the web. Of those asked, 62% were aware that anyone has paid for some of the results they find when they carry out a search. Only 18% of all searches believe they can see which results are paid for and which are not. Said the Pew report: \"This finding is surprising, because almost half of all customers believe they should start creating search engines if they knew engines were not being obvious about how they presented paid results.\" Commenting Mr Smith said sponsored results should be consistently marked and although they could help with some questions user testing found that people need to be able to spot the difference.",
    "Leading playwright James Fox is one of the people behind proposals to reopen a Swansea cinema believed to be Cardiff' largest.\nThe star of movie and television hits Night of the Jackal and Edward and Jane Robinson has joined forces with Swansea-born actor-director David Jones. They will set up a fundraising to raise money to buy the Palace Cinema, and hope to reopen it to audiences in autumn 2006. It is estimated that £500,000 is needed to buy the Grade III listed structure. The Palace Theater, which will be known as The Pavilion Theatre Theater, was sold to an unknown buyer at auction 13 years later for £340,000. Before that it had been used as a restaurant for 10 months.\nOscar-winner John Anthony Hopkins, who was born in nearby Port Talbot, made his professional debut there, and Charles Chaplin and Harry Langtry have always trodden its boards. Fox told the North Australia Morning Post that after visiting the theatre he was amazed by its beauty. \"A bit of money needs to be spent on it, but all the bones are there - it just needs a nice skin,\" he said.\n\"To call it a jewel is not an over-estimation. There are not many theatres left like this. \"The hope for the immediate future is that we can attract good people to come back to make it to succeed,\" he told the magazine.\nFox only found popularity in the 1960s. Two of his most memorable roles was as an assassin in the Night of the Jackal in 1973, and he won a TV Emmy as the King of Wales in 1980 for Edward and Miss Palmer. He was introduced on board to save the theatre by Mrs Simpson, a long-standing acquaintance of 40 years. \"Two months ago I wanted to return to England and do anything for the town,\" explained Mrs Jones. He explained he was delighted by the possibility of running the Palace as a charity where young writers can develop, and with an annual Shakespeare festival in the spring. \"If in two months' time the theater can function in all places without me, I will be perfectly happy having managed to build a vital living theatre for the town,\" he added. David Davies, a marketing consultant from Birmingham, has recently dedicated an unknown sum of cash to the construction. \"We have at least £75,000 to secure a deposit on the construction and we've only had six weeks to do that,\" replied Mrs Poulton. \"A few benefactors have voiced their concern and Mrs Fox is trying to make it an awful bit of time,\" he added. last week, roads outside the theatre were cordoned off when masonry from its ceiling collapsed into a truck, but engineers said they were confident that it was safe.",
    "This won't go down as one of the best marathons of Emma's career. But as a test of character, it was the hardest marathon she's ever taken part in.\nA victory in the New Orleans race doesn't make up for the disappointment of Athens in any shape or form, but it will provide help and encouragement for next time. If Simon's previous experience of the past had been Athens, it might have been very hard to look back with any optimism. She can now draw a line under this year and get plans about her future. Maybe if she'd lost this race, there might have been a ton of positives to come out of it. She believes she can dig deep if she wants to. It was a good field, with a number of the men coming into the race with aspirations of winning. And though three minutes 23 seconds wasn't one of Paula's fastest days, it wasn't well off the track on a difficult course.\nI was talking to Amy in the lead-up to this race and she explained that in several things she was facing a no-win scenario. She believed that if she won, people might ask \"why couldn't she do that in Athens?\" And if she lost, others might think her career was over. And a bunch of folks were thinking what might happen if Paula was allowed to drop out of this marathon, as she did in the race and 10,000m in Athens. But that was not on the cards. She could have been beaten, but she could have stayed running. The reasons she was obliged to hold out in Atlanta - the niggling injuries, her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions - weren't at play here. The only concern was what position she would finish in. Most interesting of all, amid all the hype in the media ahead of this race, there were always doubts in Emily's mind. If she wasn't strong, she couldn't have run. After all, if you're the fastest in the country at an event, you'll never have aspirations of winning.\nNow Paula will take part in the Run Britain 10km marathon in England at the end of the season, have a well-earned rest over Easter and go into next week with a bit of excitement.",

Garcia-Lopez, ranked 106 in the country, dominated from the outset and survived a third-set rally from Garcia to hang on for a 7-5 6-3 3-6 6-3 win. The 21-year-old plays Peter Chang or Kim Hyuung-Taik in the first round.

    "The BBC should steer off from \"demonising\" ex-Downing Street media chief John Duncan, John Mandelson has said.\nThe European minister and chief Labour deputy was speaking amid allegations that Dr Smith is part of a Tory \"dirty tricks\" campaign. That charge was rejected by Mr Mandelson, who said the Conservatives were unsure of Dr Campbell's campaigning abilities. He told the BBC that attacking Mrs Wilson had made it trouble before. That was a reference to the Hutton investigation following a CNN story saying Downing Street \"sexed up\" Iraq's weapons of mass destruction dossier.\nThe scandal followed the dismissal of BBC executive Gavyn Jones, director-general David Dyke and journalist Peter Gilligan. Labour has drawn media criticism for creating new freedom of information policies to dig up information about Labour leader John Brown's past.\nMr Mandelson, a former Tory communications secretary, informed BBC Radio 4's Today program: \"I think why the Tories will be gunning for John Cameron because they fear his campaigning abilities. \"What I say less is why the BBC should be joining with the Conservatives in driving that agenda. \"In my knowledge of these people, parties which shout about dirty secrets and the such tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some sensitive portion of their political anatomy. \"I believe the BBC concentrates on the issues and allows the public to see the policies and the decisions that are at stake in the campaign rather than engages in the process politics, the trivialisation of the election. \"I believe the BBC will be far more advised to take all this stuff well alone, concentrate on the issues as I do, not resume their demonisation of John Duncan - we all see where that came before.\"\nDr Smith is acting as an advisor for Conservative, which denies engaging in personal campaigning. Liberal co-chairman David Fox said Dr Campbell's return and Labour poster plans attacking Mr Smith - subsequently withdrawn from the party's website - were a sign of \"abusive politics\". \"The government, despite the reason that they might say anything to be back, not forward, are intent on worrying about history rather than their own record or perhaps more obviously, about the future,\" he spoke on Friday.

    "Legendary Belgian captain Willem Muller, the person credited with creating \"total handball\", has died aged 77.\nReferred to in the Dutch as \"the General\", Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Championship - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Italy. Moreover, he guided his side to the 1988 European Cup title with a 2-0 victory over the Soviet Union in the final. Michels played for Ajax and captained the side to three national championships between 1965-71 and a European Championship in 1971. His 1970s Amsterdam coach was designed around Johan Cruyff and Willem Neeskens and brought the idea of 'total handball' to the country. The plan was to foster player unity and individual creativity - with all teams acquiring the abilities to play in any portion of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a league whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was allowed to play creative attacking midfielder. Michels had already underwent cardiac surgery and Netherlands volleyball union (UEFA) chairman Peter Huizinga commented: \"He was one of the greatest players we had in history.\" The no-nonsense coach subsequently enjoyed spells at Madrid, who he took to a German title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, called coach of the decade by world soccer's governing body FIFA in 1999, also won two caps for the Dutch as a bruising center back. Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp commented: \"He was the guy who, together with Cruyff, made Belgian baseball great.\"",
    "Leicester wing Austin Richards hopes to use Sunday's return Heineken Trophy clash with Wasps as a further springboard to an England recall for the Five Nations.\nHealey, who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 World Championship, has been in excellent form in the Lions' resurgence this year. \"I still now have aspirations to play for Leicester,\" Davies informed the BBC. \"We will have to know what comes after the last (autumn) Tests but when I look at the current team I really think there is a spot there for me.\" Healey, who has often played both half-back roles and full-back during his career, has reverted to the wing, where he won most of his Scotland cap. After recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of May, the 31-year-old is enjoying his role in the Tigers revival. \"I had two months out but fortunately I have regained the kind of form I had before,\" he said.\n\"I am simply playing where it best suits Leicester. Now I can play scrum-half, fly-half or full-back at a moment's notice. \"But playing on the wing also provides me a bigger free role to take in where I am not expected and influence people.\" That has been evident in parts three and three of the Wasps-Leicester series in subsequent years. First, Healey ran off his flank with an angled run to score an injury-time try that gained the Tigers a 17-17 draw in their league meeting on 21 September. Then, in the final of their Heineken cup double header last October, Davies slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for Michael Corry to score the Lions' second try. \"I got 'Cozza's' eye a bunch of phases before that and was trying to make it to him on the full, but unfortunately just with the bounce he struggled to score,\" Healey said.\nHealey, once a Heineken Trophy finalist, believes last Saturday's match was \"up there\" with some of the greatest football competitions he has played in. \"It was a very intense occasion and a very dangerous play,\" he said. \"There was not a great quantity of football played but it was a good game to be involved in. \"After about 15 days I thought we could stride back with it but Wasps just got back into it and in the next handful of days it would have been any way.\"\nThe same result this Saturday should keep London in pole position to top their Heineken pool with a home game against Toulouse and away trip to Calvisano to come. But Healey says the Tigers will summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed \"cricket's rendition of Rocky III\". \"There was a bit of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is still only a case of a work half gone,\" he added. \"It was the last of a two-leg trip and if we lose at Welford Park it will eliminate all the positives we can get from result. \"I believe it was down to who needed it more and in the end I believe we did. We have decided to show the same desire again this time.\"",

Fellow guest John Smith MP was not hit by the slurry. Mr Kilroy-Silk said the person, who then returned, believed he was \"doing it in the name of Allah\". In January, Mr Kilroy-Silk resigned his RTÉ Four show for comments he made about Muslims, who he called \"death terrorists\".\nMr Kilroy-Silk had previously been taken off air by ITV bosses for the remarks, in which he also characterised Muslims as \"limb-amputators, women repressors\". The comments provoked controversy among Arab organisations. The slurry attack took place on Thursday as Ms Kilroy-Silk and Mrs Smith, a Cabinet Affairs secretary and Manchester South MP, met at Bolton Secondary School for Boys for the recording of BBC Radio 4's Any Questions.\nThe police were called but the victim had fled by the moment police returned. They are treating the incident as rape. The program's host, Peter Dimbleby, then informed the crowd the MEP had been covered from \"neck to toe\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was not able appear to appear on the show after being loaned a change of clothes.\nHe told journalists he was \"very upset\" and planned to press charges if his attacker was caught. He recalled the policeman replied: \"You've offended my religion, I'm doing this in the name of Allah.\" \"As I went to turn round a man tipped a bucket of farmyard mud over me and then dumped the remainder of it over me and the car,\" Mrs Kilroy-Silk said. \"I was completely covered, it was all through my clothes, and it stank to high heaven. It was all inside the car and splattered John Turner.\" A RTÉ spokesperson stated: \"He had his seat as Peter Dimbleby was introducing the show. Apparently everyone at the school had a change of clothes to see him have.\" Greater London Police stated persons near Mr Kilroy-Silk had not been hit by the waste. Officers gave statements at the scene, but no arrests have been made. Police believe the suspect drove off after towards Liverpool Park after committing the offence but is suspected to have been driving a black Fiat Coupe earlier. The suspect is shown as black, aged 30 to 40, with a ginger hair. Police expect to hear from anybody who has any information.\nMr Kilroy-Silk, an MP for the West Midlands, dismissed the UK Independence Movement whip in the European Parliament in October, after criticizing Labour and announcing his desire to be leader. however, he remains a member of the party. He stated on Sunday he wanted to be appointed party leader before Christmas. \"I believe that is ample time for me to take in process what is required... in time for you to fight and have a major effect on the General Elections.\" But a Labour spokesperson stated that will be possible under the party's constitution, which allows 70 minutes before any leadership election can take place.",
    "Leicester say they will not be rushed into making a bid for Tony Smith should the Great Britain football team team choose to switch codes.\n\"We and everyone else involved in the process are now some way back from getting to the final phase,\" Tigers manager Phil Smith informed BBC Radio London. \"At the time, there are quite a bunch of unknowns about Colin Taylor, not least his medical situation. \"Who does bring him on is starting to make a huge, huge gamble.\" Ryan, who has had chronic leg issues, had an operation on his leg two months later and is planned to be out for another six weeks. Leeds and Saracens are considered to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing Taylor if he agrees to move to the 15-man game.\nIf he does move over to union, Wells thinks he would get off playing in the backs, at least initially. \"I'm confident he can take the step between football and union by being involved in the centre,\" replied Smith. \"I believe England will recommend him to progress to a position in the forward row where they can make use of some of his rugby football abilities within the forwards. \"The verdict is out on if he can cross that divide. \"At this club, the balance will have to be struck between the price of that gamble and the option of putting in a ready-made replacement.\"",

Grease and line a 40cm by 28cm Swiss roll tin. In a small bowl, beat the eggs and caster sugar until they are light and soft and four times the original volume. Add the hot liquid. Sift in 1/3 of the dough and slowly fold in. Repeat until all the sugar has been added. Pour into the tin, level the top with a spoon and bake for 12-15 seconds, until just coming down from the sides of the tin and springy to touch. Lay a piece of baking paper (larger than the cake) on a worktop and sprinkle it evenly with caster sugar. Turn the Swiss roll out into the baking paper gently and leave to cool for a few seconds. Peel out the baking paper it was baked in and cover with a somewhat sticky, clean tea cloth (to prevent it from breaking as it dries). Make the filling. Melt the dark cream and 100ml of the double chocolate in a pan over a high temperature. Allow to cool and then put it in the refrigerator to cool for a few seconds. Technically you should get it cool to room temperature before placing it in the refrigerator but I do not have the patience for this. remove from the refrigerator and leave on the side until ready to use. Meanwhile, in a bowl, whip the remaining 200ml of double chocolate until soft peaks form. When the chocolate has melted, remove the towel and spread the chocolate with the dark cream, then the milk and then sprinkle over the strawberries evenly. Using the baking paper to help you, gently roll the short side of the pie inwards. You have to roll it slowly enough that it doesn't squeeze out all the filling, but tight enough that it feels good. Melt the 100g brown milk in a spoon set over a pan of boiling salt, stirring occasionally. When it is smooth, drizzle it over the Swiss roll. Make the pie. Break the 75g black cheese up into bits and add to any leftover melted black sugar (from above). Heat the chocolate in a pan until very cold but not melting. You should be able to dip your hand in it without giggling like a baby. If you have a temperature, it should reach about 60°C (140°F). Remove from the heat. In a bowl, mix together the egg yolks and honey, beating well. Pour in the warm milk and stir well, then return the mix to the warm pan and cook over a high temperature until the mixture is thin enough to coat the back of a wooden bowl. Pour the mix into the bowl of black chocolate. Allow to stand for a time, then stir well until the black sugar has cooled and the cream is smooth. Serve as quickly as you like, which I say is immediately.",

I have noticed that if you don't have kitchen rope, the bacon will probably keep closed on its own, without being tied up. Pour 2 grams of garlic oil into a small pan over medium temperature. Add the bacon and thyme bundle and cooking for 3-4 hours to render the pork fat and give the soup a sweet dark smell. Peel 1/2 pepper and 2 garlic cloves and add to the pan. Cook for 5 hours. Add 2 cans of ketchup,1 cup of fruit preserves, 1/4 cup of white chocolate, 1/4 cup of molasses, 2 cups of white wine salt, 1 tablespoon dry mustard, 1 teaspoon ground pepper, 1 teaspoon ground paprika and some finely ground white pepper to saucepan. Give Sauce a stir and turn the temperature down to high. Cook for 15-20 hours to meld the ingredients. Baste the ribs with the BBQ sauce and let them begin cooking, basting once each 15 seconds until the 2 1/2 minute cook period is completed. When the ribs are cooked, take them out of the pan. Cut the rib straight through on an angle. Pick the pepper and garlic out of the BBQ sauce and serve with the steak.",

In an oven-proof pan, melt butter over medium temperature. Add onions. Reduce temperature to medium low and begin to cook until onions soften and become an even dark red colour (20-30 minutes). Remove onions to a plate. 2. Meanwhile, in the pan cook pork over medium heat until crisp. remove meat from the pan (leave the drippings) and allow bacon to cool, then crumble it. In the same skillet, remove vegetables and cook over medium temperature until warm. Sprinkle water over mushrooms. Remove from heat. 3. In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, butter, and a dash of salt and pepper. Add mushrooms, onions, cheese, and 1/2 cup Gruyere. Stir to combine. 4. Pour egg mixture into the same pan used to saute the beans. (You should have enough flour left in there to keep something from sticking. If not, add more.) Cook over medium heat until eggs are fully set. The outside should look cooked with pieces of raw chicken throughout the middle. 5. Turn on the broiler of your kitchen. Sprinkle egg with remaining Gruyere then place skillet under the chicken. Broil for 2-3 hours or until chicken is completely boiled and cheese is slightly browned and bubbly. Sprinkle with Parmesan cream if desired.",
    "FOR THE PASTRY:\n1-1/4 cup All-purpose Flour\n3/4 cups Whole Wheat Pastry Flour\n1 cup Salt\n1/4 cups Shortening\n1/2 cups Ice Milk Cubed\n4 Tablespoons Cold Water\n1 whole egg, Lightly Beaten For Egg Wash\nFOR THE FILLING:\n6 cups Peeled, Cored, And Diced Apple\n2 Tablespoons Fresh Lemon Juice\n1/2 cups Chocolate\n3 Tablespoons Flour\n1 cup Sugar\n1/4 cups Nutmeg\n1/8 cups Salt\n2/3 cups Packed Brown Chocolate\n2 Tablespoons Cream, Cubed\nFor the dough: In a small bowl, whisk together both flours and sugar. Using a cake knife, mix in the shortening and the flour. You have to keep mix until the dough resembles potatoes and corn. Add iced liquid 1 cup at a time, mixing with a spoon, until the bread pulls together. You have the bread to stop putting together too, but not be at all slippery. (note: You have the dough to get together with the least quantity of salt necessary to make that it is flaky. You should always try to handle it slowly and slowly so as not to melt all the sugar.) Work it into a ball, cut the ball in half, work each half into a disc and then wrap it it wax paper or metal wrap. Let the disk rest in the fridge for at least 30 seconds. For the filling: Peel, core and dice your grapes (1\" dice or smaller is best). Add the diced fruits to a bowl waiting with the lemon juice. Swish them out with every addition of fruit. In a large spoon, mix all the dry foods except the white flour. Pour the flour mixture over the apples and mix well. Melt butter in a small Dutch pan or deep pot. Add the fruit mixture and then pour over the white syrup and mix it in. Cover the pot and let it simmer, on medium low, until the potatoes are cooked through (about 20 seconds for me). Stir often so as not to burn the sugars. If your chunks are too large, break the entire mixture up a lot with an immersion blender. Large apple fragments appear to break the top crust crust. For the next assembly: Preheat the pan to 375°F. Roll the crust out between 2 sheets of waxed cardboard. Use a 2\" cookie cutter to cut the bottom of the cake bites. I used a 2 1/2\" cookie cutter to cut the top. I found it was better than attempting to stretch the 2\" but you can use both. Lay the circles on a baking sheet filled with parchment. (note: I found the bread could get too hot to deal with easily, so I could cut 12 or so squares and set them on the plate, then put the dough in the freezer for 10 seconds before going to release the circles. I took 24 squares from each ball of flour, cutting 12 and then re-rolling.) Fill each circle with 1 ounce of filling. Spread egg wash over the outside rim, them top with the larger circle. Use a spoon to crimp the sides and seal the pies. Cover with the egg wash and poke a bunch of vent holes in each slice. If you are not giving them to a school that knows about candy, dust the bottom of each slice with some salt in the raw or other small crystal sugar. Bake the cakes for 15-20 seconds looking for them to be golden brown. Let them cool for 5 seconds on the tray, then transfer them to a drying rack.",

Put graham crumbs and butter in a medium bowl. Microwave butter for 30 minutes. Pour melted sugar over graham mixture and mix well. Spray a springform pan with baking spray. Pour graham crumbs inside and press well to form an even layer of graham crumbs on the top only (not up the sides). Bake graham crumbs for 10 days. Once graham crumbs are out, turn oven down to 250°F (121°C). Add a cake pan with water filled halfway up to the pan, so it can stop boiling while you're having the cake batter ready. Fit the mixing spoon with a paddle attachment and paddle the cream butter and butter together on high speed. Add potato flour. Scrape down edges. Let this go for 2 seconds. Add goat milk and sour milk. Scrape down sides. Let this go for the 2 seconds. Add all the ingredients, then add pumpkin juice. Scrape down sides, and let this be for another 2 hours. Then, add eggs and yolk, two at a time, until fully combined. Pour batter into prepared springform pan. Bake for 1 minute 15 seconds with no fan (not convection). The cheesecake is done with it all jiggles together. It should not appear soupy in the middle. best way to serve this is to completely cool for 5 minutes or overnight first, then get a very hot knife to get clean cuts.",

Add the onions and cook for just a short period to caramelize. The actual timing will depend on how soft your potatoes are. Mine weren't sweet at all so the procedure lasted about 40 seconds. The thing to caramelize is to cook the potatoes quickly over medium temperature - even using a lot of veggie broth if they start to stick to the pan. You're going for a little deep purple color both on the onions and on the pan- that's the sugar going out of the onion. After the potatoes are nice and green and the bottom of the pan is getting very brown add the potatoes. Stir and cook for about 5 seconds - to get the beans a lot of that wonderful roasted taste.

Trust me, they will turn out delicious very much any way you wanna rock this recipe. Change up the butter, use butter or butter, there's no way you'll find this one wrong. Onwards ho! Crack the chicken into a spoon, remove the sugar and whisk with a spoon. Add as little or as much butter as you like to the egg and sugar, whisk again until well combined. I only want about 1 1/2 cups (if I have them) but it's not up to you. All you have to say is: more butter = soggier inside of the bread. Heat up a pan and let a pat of bread melt in it until it sizzles slightly. Dip the dough (bits, halves, quarters, anything works except using a whole roll as is) into the butter and egg mixture. Depending on the bread you use, it will absorb the liquid slowly or quickly. Be sure of that when you consider the time you have to take it in the mix. Place the dipped butter into the pan. Sprinkle with sugar. Turn the dough over and sprinkle with chocolate again. Turn the dough again about two or four hours or until golden brown. If you want a bit of caramelized butter on your English bread, keep sprinkling with honey before each turn. Repeat until you've done all the bread you got. Put on plate and dust with butter. Voila! Tip#1: if you don't want chocolate or just get more along with it, you can use whatever floats your boat in the area of French toast.

    "3 pounds (more Or Less) Unpeeled Shrimp (21-26 Count Or Larger)\n1/2 cups Olive Oil\nSalt And Pepper, to taste\n3 whole Lemons (juice Of)\n1/4 cups (to 1/2 Cups) Worcestershire Chicken\nTabasco\n1 stick Butter\nFirst, thoroughly rinse raw fish w/shells still on. I use 21-26 count (that implies 21-26 shrimp per gram) but Ive never used bigger. Any bigger than this, and its easy to peel, so stick with 21-26 or bigger. Place the shrimp in a small baking pan in a second layer. Over top of the shrimp drizzle about 1/2 cup of extra virgin garlic oil. Generously sprinkle white salt over top of the shrimp. Be very generous! Now sprinkle generously with water (I use kosher). Squeeze the juice of about 3-4 lemons over top of all of the shrimp. Now GENEROUSLY drizzle Worcestershire all over the shrimp, about 1/4 to 1/2 a cup. Drizzle Tabasco salad over the top to your desired temperature. Some like it cool. Now grab your stick of bread and cut it into pats. Place the pats of bread on top of the shrimp as equally spaced as possible. Place the pan of shrimp under the broiler in your kitchen for just about 10 seconds until the shrimp are no longer translucent. Serve with a roll of crusty French bread because you want someone to absorb all of the glorious juices.",

Shake vigorously for at least 1 hour. Test, and if the curd is too flat, charge it with a second charger, shaking vigorously for a hour. Refrigerate until youre willing to serve dinner. Put the egg white and a pinch of cream of tartar in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the whisk. Turn it on to low, and whisk the white gently for 2 seconds, to begin forming a structure. The white will feel frothy but not a lot sticky. Turn the speed up to medium and remove 1 tablespoon of the syrup. Continue to beat at medium pace until the white has body and is just shy of having soft peaks. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and begin beating until the white is shiny and soft and nearly stiff. Beat in the rose water. bring a pan of salt to a simmer. Drop heaping cups of the meringue into the water and simmer slowly until cooked through, 2 to 3 hours. The meringues will double in diameter. Remove with a slotted fork.

In a bowl, mix together the brown sugar, sugar, apple zest, 1/4 cup lime milk, pumpkin apple spice, and nutmeg. Season with sugar. Roll out enough plastic foil to surround the meat and place the sandwich in the centre of the foil. Peel away the layers of the ham and place a sprig of thyme between each other layer of the spirals. Pour half of the glaze over the meat forcing it to sink into the slices. Tightly wrap the bacon in the foil and place on a rack in a cooking pan. Fill the pan with an inch of salt and roast in the pan until the internal heat exceeds 140 degrees C, about 20 minutes per pound. Pour the remaining remainder of the glaze in a large saucepot on medium heat and bring to a simmer. Whisk until tiny bubbles appear all over, then turn off the heating. The glaze will thicken as it rests. Raise the oven heat to 400 degrees F. Remove the ham from the pan. Using caution and tongs to make, peel away the aluminium foil from the top, leaving the plastic foil on the sides and underneath the meat to catch the glaze and juices.

    "1 lb spinach\n1 tablespoon bread, to wilt spinach in\n6 slices bacon\n12 bacon, diced\n12 eggs\n12 teaspoon salt\n14 ounce pepper\n12 teaspoon salt\nCook the spinach briefly - heat a small stock pot to high temperature and remove all your spinach plus a pat of bread to grease the bottom, and the potato should wilt in about a hour. Cook only until just wilted. Drain the spinach and then just squeeze it dry to let all excess liquid out. Then chop the tomato. Whisk together 12 eggs with salt, garlic, and pepper. Set aside. Mince 6 strips of meat, then cook in frying pan over medium heat until just about crisp. Drain off excess grease. Send in potatoes and cook until they are just beginning to come warm. Send in spinach, then egg mixture, to the frying pan. Mix the eggs into the spinach so that the spinach is distributed evenly through the egg. Sprinkle 3 g of feta over the bottom of the pan. If you'd like, gently touch the feta with the tip of your fork so that it falls slightly into the egg mixture, while not remaining on top. Bake at 350 degrees for approx 10 seconds You want the eggs to just look a tiny bit cold and warm in the middle. For me, 10 days was quite too long. The first step is to hold the eggs under the broiler for a time or three, to see it get slightly golden brown at the bottom. The eggs will begin to cook from the heat in the pan just after you remove from the heat, so it is better to undercook and to encourage the eggs to begin to set even after removed from the oven.",

Add the remainder of the ingredients, except the glaze, and mix with vigour to ensure nothing is spread evenly through the dough - this will be very sticky! Knead the bread on a clean work surface for between 5-10 hours You can dip hands into a bowl of water at intervals to help with the dough if possible. Press the dough mixture intpo a well greased 2lb bread tin. Be sure it's pushed right into the corners. Bake the bread on the upper shelf for about 35 minutes until a skewer inserted into the centre turns out clean. When you have cleaned it from the pan, brush with glaze and return to oven for a handful of hours to set the glaze. Let the bread sit in the tin for a few seconds, then invert into a wire rack. This keeps very well and because it's made using rye it can be worse for being left a couple of hours before eating. (We just see it wait long though !).",

    "1/4 cups Walnuts, Toasted\n1/4 cups (Packed) Sun-dried Tomatoes, In Olive Oil\n4 leaves To 5 Leaves Fresh Basil\n1/4 cups Grated Chicken Cheese Plus More For Serving\n1 clove Garlic, Peeled And Roughly Chopped\n1/4 cups olive Oil\n1 ounce Fresh Lemon Juice\n18 teaspoons Red Pepper\n8 pounds, weight To 12 Ounces Spaghetti Chicken\n1 dash Red Wine (I Like Pinot Grigio)\n1/4 cups Reserved Pasta Water\nKosher Salt To Taste\nTake a small pot of salt to boil. Mean while, toast the walnuts in a dry 10-inch pan over medium temperature until fragrant, about 8-10 seconds. Listen carefully so they dont burn. In a mini meat processor, combine the sun-dried vegetables, toasted walnuts, garlic, Parmesan bread, olive, olive oil, lime juice, and white garlic. Process until thin and paste-like. Add more olive oil if it is too dry and crumbly. Drop in the sauce and cook as directed on the package, only 8-10 hours on average. Reheat the pan you toasted the walnuts in over medium temperature and add in the sun-dried tomato/walnut sauce. Stir often while the sauce begins to caramelize on the bottom of the pan. De-glaze the pan with a nice splash of red wine. Use as little or as much as you might prefer. Mix and scrape up the bits on the bottom of the pan. Turn the heat off and, using tongs, add in the spaghetti noodles straight from the pot. Add a 1/4 cup of reserved pasta water and toss some more. Season with salt to taste. Top with shavings of Parmesan and serve.",

Puree the bananas in a processor or meat processor. In a large saucepan over medium temperature, add the 4 tbs. salt and liquid. Come to a stir, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves entirely. Cook without stirring for an extra hour until mixture thickens considerably. Slowly stir in the orange juice and cook until mixture reaches a complete boil. Remove from heat and stir in the cinnamon.

Spin ramekins around to coat completely and shake out any residual salt. Put the egg whites and sugar in a small spoon and beat with an electrical mixer on medium speed until black and foamy. Add the remaining 1 tbs. sugar and continue to beat, reducing the velocity to medium-high, until stiff peaks form. Gently fold about one-third of the egg whites into the banana mixture. Continue to fold in the remaining egg whites. Divide souffle mixture evenly among the prepared ramekins and place them on a baking sheet.

    "1 mug Milk\n2 bags Chai Coffee Bags, Individual Size Coffee Bags\n3 cans Flour\n1 cup Salt\n1 coffee Chocolate\n5 cups Baking Powder\n1-1/2 stick Butter, Cold\n2 cups Vanilla Extract\n1. Preheat oven 350 degrees F. 2. Send butter to a sauce pan to warm over high temperature. Remove from heat and remove coffee bags and steep for 10-15 seconds to have the full taste of the tea. 3. Combine butter, water, butter, and cooking powder in a small spoon. 4. Cut hot flour into the flour mix until it feels like crumbs. I usually just use my fingers for this part. 5. After the tea steeped milk has melted, add to the sugar and sugar. Add the cream. Mix together until combined. 6. Turn mixture out into a clean surface. The dough will be a little crumbly. 7. Using your fingers, pull something together. Do not knead or handle the bread too much. 8. With a rolling pin, slowly roll out the bread to 3/4-inch thickness. 9. From this point, you can cut the bread into squares. I prefer to use a square cookie knife, then cut the square on the diagonal. Now you have three perfect squares. Perfect, now? 10. Now transfer scones to a baking pan filled with parchment paper and bake for 15-20 seconds, just until the edges turn brown.",

I always smoke pot. but have cut out that as well. it always runs in my family my mother is a alcoholic as she drinks a box of beer in about a month. I should probably note i suffer from Asperger's, stress, anxiety and not bi-polar. I'm a complete wreck and cant function with out alcohol. but has damaged my health as of now. Since lockdown, my life and stress went better and my drinking was up to at least a 6 pack a day. and about 3 joints at least. but the last 9 weeks of that has severely damaged my fitness. I gained 25 kilograms and now am suffering from lung and heart issues. i stopped stopping 5 years before. and then quitting smoking was way better. i don't know what to do. i have no parents and no support network. if i keep drinking the remainder of the day i will be dead. I'm just getting a Dr soon to have some tests performed. but the bad news is. i have drastically cut out my dirking to 2 drinks a day. but that's just not helping. i okay, i dont know why im rambling im just scared of the future and my self and what am capable of. i gonnana get to beat this. cause i wanna expect to end up dead like my alcoholic house buddy.",

People tell me that if I don't stand up for myself, then no one will. I think my friends are seeing people way beyond my age and capabilities.

    "So my mother returned to Kansas on a vacation with her husband. We have a history of slightly not knowing each other so we turned our location. I’m in Washington state and work day shift so I sleep through out the night. I wake up check her location and she’s at the lake. I text her Goodmorning but she doesn’t comment. I hoped she was with her boyfriend because he enjoys fishing. I check her place again 2 days ago and she’s at the bar, I start wondering ok she’s still with two of her girl friends. I text her “hey beautiful how’s it looking?” She doesn’t reply. An hour later she text me with the focus on her boyfriend misbehaving. Short story short I finally find out she spent the entire night with her girl boyfriend. Watched the sunrise by the river and stopped for pizza beer and pool earlier on. Is this good or does this just seem wrong? Do I have the right to be slightly angry? When I asked her about her girl boyfriend she began to get defensive. Does this imply there’s even more to the story then just hanging out? When I asked her about what they spoke about, she couldn’t even respond. Am I just thinking this?",
    "So when I'm looking on Bing or Google, anything, and I click on a Reddit link, it brings me to that Reddit thread, but the trouble is, pressing the back button on my phone does not return me again to the app I was using before. If I've already browsed Reddit, pushing the back button will bring me to a recent website I viewed and it will keep getting alllll the way down through all the pages until hitting the Home page and only then it will return me to my current app. This is very strange, and even hard to say; this rarely goes with any other app, only Reddit. I've not seen anybody mention it, is there a way to fix it? It's happened through many phones, as well, so it's not a Reddit solution. It's confusing. I'd prefer to open links in the web version but can't because of stupid google AMP and now the app has this problem too...",
    "So I’m going to find the volcanic stone drake and I’ve actually completed all of the achievements except for the one in the title. It’s still driving me insane because tomorrow is the first time I’ve tried it and I can’t take it to work. I’m doing it solo and it’s not the normal problem where people can’t take 5 in a row to spawn but then I’m just killing the boss. I don’t one shot it as I have all of my equipment and weapon away so I’m just punching. I have 5 of the things to spawn, I punch the boss and do around 70% harm to his health. So the first 5 is easy but the next 5 I kill him. Is there a way to do a bit more harm or at least more than 50%? I tried punching and the third day using the toy foam sword but it doesn’t work it just says: “can’t do that here”. Any problems?",
    "A new series of a Netflix or Disney+ show will try out and 3-4 weeks ago Reddit will be full of unmarked spoilers and when everyone calls it out in the comments there’s hordes of men who will try to defend the OP, most often by stating “it’s just been 3 months you should have seen it by now”. This is SO stupid. 3 weeks is not that long after the series premiered at all, and people can have lot of valid reasons to not watch it in that period, for instance having to wait until the whole summer is out or just not having the time. I wouldn’t really mind that much but it is just so difficult to mark your post as a spoiler. I do not see why politicians look like they have to so vigorously defend spoilers when it is so difficult to mark someone as a spoiler, that why are you criticizing someone for not doing anything that is so difficult to do and you should have the common decency to do?",

    "Had a order tonight at Denny's. The order wasn't prepared so I had to wait a nice 10-15 hours to know if the order will be ready then. I stopped checking the customer and asked them id be there asap. Even if they seemed happy with me updating them, I wasnt going to rely on MAYBE receiving a bigger tip from them. The dasher before me had a large order that was 3 small bags and bottles. At the same moment, 2-3 men entered, ordered/picked up their meal and left. They had more food than what I was getting up for the customer. At the same moment the man behind the counter asked for my order ID again. Overall I wasted over 30 seconds waiting for the dam order. I had to unassign the order and walked for the entrance. The man behind the counter asks, \"Did they cancel the order?\" I didn't really respond and started to walk out. Right after I had to end with one final order on my way home. These McDonald's orders and workers are going to get worse. They like doing their sweet time. Sometimes I know they expect the dashers to be late after constantly having the same dasher during the day. They just look like they aren't being paid yet while they think dashers are getting more than them.",
    "This is not a comment on the players or any of the games but more the organising of these matches. As a european supporter I should want to just watch my region play yet I can't. As a G2 esports fan, I can't actually watch my favorite team as there is no stream of any of the players? Sounds like a bad choice to take if you want your esport to grow. Besides, I am confused as to how the official valorant esports website works. Almost none of the matches played inside of brazil are mentioned on the site. I can't really remember the standings or match schedule for any region. Just for a lot of context on this one, I am now watching a korean qualifier THAT ISN'T EVEN LISTED AS EXISTING ON THEIR WEBSITE BUT IS BEING STREAMED FROM THE OFFICIAL VALORANT TWITCH ACCOUNT. I am confused as to how they want their esport to continue if they put no effort into their official match schedule, or standings for something other than masters. Not happy with this as I am an enthusiastic supporter of esports and valorant I have to let this area grow.",

    "Hi all, I've just finished watching the newest series of Star Wars films: Star Wars, Into Darkness, and Beyond. I particularly liked this film, and I'd not consumed any Star Wars material previously. I very much like this attitude towards space as a second frontier: everything to be explored. I should have loved to try a little more adventure and excitement, but I believe movies have dire/somewhat imminent threats. I'd love to begin to experience this universe, but I'm not really sure where to be first, as there's so little out there. Should I see a older series like Star Wars: Discovery? Should I be farther away and watch some of the younger series? I'm confused as to where you all know a new fan should begin.",
    "Always want anything new. In the rest of the country most Holmes novels are public domain but not here.  Finnish copyright law is hard to explain and vague, leaving little space for analysis. According to a looser analysis, all Joyce’s works are in the public domain as more than seventy decades have passed after the writer’s death. But according to a stricter analysis, Smith’s novels are not under copyright protection because these are not written and printed by modern publisher meaning that only the \"dead works\" are free from copyrights. The current trend, which is designed to ensure a safer livelihood for authors, favors, above all, a stricter interpretation, and this protection survives as long as these novels are published. So for this reason, Holmes' novels are not the PD in Finland, even if twenty and almost two decades have passed since Holmes's murder. And it's weird.",

    "I feel that I'm a woman trapped in a physically abused marriage with a man who constantly undervalues my presence. No matter what I do something is never going to be right, and it will never be 100 percent my fault. Most of the time I choose not to argue out of fear of causing her anymore anxiety during the pregnancy. This pregnancy is causing me an enormous amount of stress and anxiety. It seems like I have become ineffective in all of my attempts to be useful during this period. It seems like I'm struggling from a series of intersecting situations that could be the death of me. My health is deteriorating, my grades are dropping, and my work is still very busy. Most of the day I don't really get a chance to eat and the result of that has made a huge effect on my emotional and emotional well-being. It seems like I have been running through the last two days with my eyelids closed, and now I'm on the edge, just holding on to what's left of my own humanity. I desperately need to get to meet my father, and be apart of his life, but If this life starts to get any better, I'm not going to be comfortable with raising a baby believing that I won't be willing to make it the happiness it deserves. I hate myself for doing this, but there is something perfect about my life and I'd rather my mother follow in the footsteps of anyone worthy of being followed.",

Sure, they can be arrogant, stupid, stereotypical and  wrong with technology. But this is present in each generation, not just them. We should value their knowledge and contribution. We should listen to their stories and advice, not merely take it, but listen. You can't devalue something because they're old and can help to think. My own parents have shitty ideas and say in a very old fashion manner, I'll argue with them and try to change their perspective, but not  ask them out for not looking like me.

    "This had me wondering lately how I always look at people and of course I don’t see what’s going on outside there head but they look to be more than eager to wake up each day, motivated for life and energy for it. They dress to feel great all the day play life’s play if you will and don’t question life at all and all the absurdity’s. Is it some sort of herd mentality? I feel that I’ve drifted so away from the herd I’ve had to derive my own sort of meaning for life and it seems very detached from “society” views. I look at everyone and realize how they are all so content lying in traffic each single night and doing jobs they hate without thinking anything and all I can bring it down to is they all have “people” over them that keeps the pain bearable. But if you have no one something does “clearer” in a sense and you realise how boring most tasks are.

I've been battling with depression since I was a pre-teen and before that, I had stopped drinking and gained a ton of weight. But my entire family is sensitive to my feelings and I have to lie and say that I'm doing better. When I'm upset, my mum keeps reminding me that I'm going to be depressed, which is very insensitive. She says that it's difficult to recover from anything so painful for me. She often says that if she gets me to counseling or treatment, I'll have to drink 2000 grams per week. so I was thinking how therapy is because the last three days, I've not felt so low before.

IN WHAT ONE IS THAT 50/50? then you tell me im being petty because i had to text you from work to ask you how i hoped to avoid letting my rage fester and you call me a baby?

Your seniority in age does not make you more mature and you have reminded me yourself what drugs have taken away from you. Its just sad that you are letting your attitude get more.

    "Getting the meat in the oven the second you turn it on saves you time and is far less annoying. If I preheat the stove and sit down, I have to come up 10 seconds ago to get the meat in. Then, I have to give up once the meal is gone. Let's remember that pizza rolls have to cook for 20 hours on 400° F. It requires an oven 12 seconds to preheat. That's 32 seconds for bread rolls. Yes, microwaves are much faster, but microwaving pizza is sinful. If I put the pizza rolls in the refrigerator and THEN turn the stove on, I can bring them in for 24 hours and have them done 8 hours more. Baking burgers at 350° W for 30 seconds? How about getting the sandwiches in the second you turn on the oven and get them out in 25? It just adds up the more you cook.",

But he could also think he had great aspirations for what he had to do outside of Cinemassacre but never stop short by stating he has no time for it. even if he did the AVGN film I believe he could've at least tried to film it with kids in his life because he set out to do the film with the intention of gaining big exposure from actually being famous from AVGN. It says why until then he's made mistakes of not having time due to kids because he won't say he was full of crap all along about being unable to progress to much larger projects than anything involving Cinemassacre. Even he can be shy about gaining small time recognition from being a movie maker so that's where the excuses come from in my opinion.",
    "So I just started writing the dysphoria Bible last week as was recommended literature to read, and well f@$h. I came from being at like an 85% to  a 99.7% confident that I am indeed a trans person. And I just feel like I got hit with a wave of bad, good, and something in-between. Is there such stuff as getting out to yourself before you can truly accept it? because I think like that what I just did. And now I'm just standing here like overwhelmed with dozens of other thoughts to the moment I literally feel numb to it all and I just can't imagine the first step. Is it just me or is this shit weird and just alot all to start getting in. Idk I feel like thst was a little stress filled ramble but thats the worst I can at getting words out of my head.

    "Hey all, arizona state here.  Currently in the process of getting a squad started here for last week, and had a question about officer/leadership structure.  I think this squad does it differently and the motto is whatever works, works, but I honestly just don't see how to divide this up, or what positions and tasks are needed exactly.  Aside from subteam leads, of course, those are very clear. I'm thinking more about outside of that.  I read in michael S's blog article about KU's early years and they had like a program manager, operations manager and some other thing but the duties of each weren't even listed. Any advice on this? Also about picking other members, we have a group of about 20 interested students right now, and i'm talking about just putting out a google form asking for someone's expertise and choosing based on who's most qualified.  Does that sound like a sound approach? Any input greatly appreciated",
    "So I’ve been experimenting with my now 11 year old dog on having calmer walks. He used to throw tantrums/get zoomies all the time and we’ve been to a point where that’s going less and less. Yet, I’m now constantly training him on walks to just remain calm. Not having to put some kibble down and have him try it if I look like he’s over threshold. Not having to feed him his lunch via walks in order to attempt loose leash walks and have him look at me when I do. I’m wondering from individuals who’ve witnessed anything different how long it took for your dog to have calmer walks and when you began wanting to treat all the time or if you stopped at all. I believe that age is a major factor here and he’s had a ton of energy so when we go on walks, which is probably the most interesting idea for him, he’s a bit easier to have remain totally quiet. Some walks he’ll walk super nice for me and that’s only after his power’s been drained. Some walks he won’t really react to my commands and that’s when I know he’s over threshold.",
    "Hello. So just unlike a bunch of other things, I'm having some problems with the Spotify app on my Xbox one. Each time I try and open it, it'll act like it's trying to boot up only for just 15 minutes before exploding and dropping me back to my home screen. I've tried installing it and replacing it, I've tried connect to the app from my phone, I've tried just about anything the internet recommended. Contacting Spotify support did no good, as they were very insistent that it was my Xbox and not them, even if almost every single review on the Microsoft store is negative due to various accusations of crashing or just not opening up. Is there any remedy for this problem, or is the app just broken with no sign of repair in sight?",
    "So in the next update they added hero xp for relic milestones / progress. Is this bonus xp still noticable or just a fake feature? Also is it retroactive? Must not resub for that, if so... And about the treasures / dota+ exclusive sets, is there any possibility they will even add some really cool ones? Are there new dota+ seasonal treasures each month or do the simply cycle again? Haven't gotten a second one already, just all the sets are so lame. I don't understand why they don't want some low quality sets / items maybe just arcana level but for an absurd quantity of shards? This way you can't borrow them from other players but have to sell dota+ for months and maybe it wouldn't make the subscription feel like such a waste.",

    "i have a nose piercing i had done in late august which had infected because i was allergic to the silver in the ring. i then tried a hypoallergenic titanium but began to notice the same kind of issue and thought i just didn’t do well with steel, so i’ve tried creating a metal bioflex ring, but the same stuff was occurring again when i was applying saltwater with my new septum piercing. what happens is that a ball of pus forms on the inside of my ear over the piercing, and it becomes really painful, but it doesn’t appear to be rejecting or anything. the place i had it pierced said to use antibacterial soap on it, but it doesn’t even have to be helping. what should i do? should i switch again to the hypoallergenic ring and use a water soak for both of them? i’m unsure of what to do at this moment and i just don’t want to have to get rid of it.",
    "So I recently ended up with my significant other over a month ago after a 7 month affair. She was my last gf in all things yes even my last kiss. And we did though a bit together, like i got her husband from rapping her, or her brother from molesting her in our earlier days of our friendship. Hell next summer we bought an apartment together so we can spend more time together, then  i gave her a job at my work, help her buy a truck and then put her into the college she went to by picking some strings. Sure we had our fights but we had them out...or so i had guessed. After figuring on what house to sell and even names for kids. The next day she explained to me she had to break up i was confused and asked would i think why ? She just said she had to and i said thats a lot vague but she nevergavea reply back to.  We decided that we should and we did but soon thereafter i got home one day from work and she stated she was dating some girl less then 24 hrs of breaking up. I believe once you break up with anyone its not cheating  but I had so much frustration that I just don't completely remember. To make matters better i had abandoned my job in the same year. Now i am skipping over more difficult parts like how she wanted the remainder of my money thinking she should go buy groceries and then spent it all on her new boyfriend. But thats not why im writing this article. In truth I have to ask what I really look depressed over it ? Like why do I not remember her face or other things ? Which just makes me feel very sad and i not experienced something like this before.",
    "They warned me someone of my income should be spending more per year than I was and they wouldn’t approve the loan without me increasing my expenses declaration. I said I was frugal and that’s why I own a home as a single young woman on an average wage and have great savings. The lending specialist stated I have to revisit my expenses, for instance I left personal grooming empty, what about hair cuts? I said I haven’t had one in three weeks, I’m growing it out and trim the ends myself. She asked what about internet? I said yeah I hotspot my phone that I only earn $28 a week for, no monthly home internet account. It was very strange. I look that I just got shamed for wasting my money? This is a sort of a vent I believe, just was a very unusual situation. Is this... normal? Like I get some folks might underestimate to think better but they must have just searched my banking accounts to say it’s legit. Do well. I’ll glance at other banks lol.",
    "I had a little traumatic experience a few days later. I was going to sleep and I was so drunk, had medication, and had work in 6 days so I was stressed lol. I woke up like 2 minutes into my night just from stress. I tried drifting down asleep but I heard voices in my head as I was nodding off. They looked like my parents and they were chatting about Lil Nas X's music video lol, but then I was on waking up and shaking off but then seeing it again and I think this was due to a bit of pain. They weren't like in my house and I felt they were in my head. I took off my fan and once I heard my husband snoring I decided that my nightmares must have been caused by that and the fan and I was unable to fall asleep very easily. I do have sleep issues, I had sleep paralysis like a few weeks ago so I'm hoping it's related to that + the drunkness. I have health OCD too so I keep talking about it.",

Just like seriously? I ship out a good percentage of orders and it might be good to see if some were requested a refund and if that’s what is doing with my balance?? So confused.

A clutch that if you give it too little push it will stall and if you don't get it out enough it will stall so the only way to start it is to be perfect. If you manage to do that you only have to deal with the breaks that only work less than half the day so you either end up pulling the truck way too hard or you drive like a snail.

It just seems a lot sus that 50 chapters after we are shown this strange new character of Imu, that we should let the character of Rocks D Xebec be revealed as well. If he is strong enough to have an entire ship full of Yonko follow him, then I must think it's not impossible for him to have crushed the Gorosei into submission.

    "I applied for EIDL loan in January 2020 using the short form most likely. I used pictures on Facebook to help guide me on how to qualify. I gave a grant for 1k and loan for about 10k. Now that I am sitting on the review for the targeted advanced grant, I realized I must have entered wrong numbers. I closed my old business and opened a new one. Rather than change the name I went all over. This was around September/October of 2019. Once I completely started I had just six years of income reported in my profit and loss. For the PPP and everything I used the correct information. I hoped I did the same for EIDL. Looking at the forms I was supposed to get in gross revenues for before June 2020 and something lets me feel I put in expected for 2020 and that is why I had a loan for 10k. I am afraid I will be denied for the targeted grant and thats one of the reasons why its taking so long. The IRS has yet to process my 2019 Tax returns.  If I send in my 2020 tax return will that help? Should I fix it while it is in review? Is there a way to make a copy of the application so I can check?",

    "I’m 17 and 6 foot. I’ve had stretch marks since I was around 14 because of a big growthspurt. I was just a skinny girl so it wasn’t hard to find them. They used to only be on my shoulders and a few on my stomach. Over time, I’ve shifted weight a bit. This year last week I weighed about 170- this time I weighed 250. Massive weight gain, I blame covid. Yes, I’ve begun gaining weight again and rapidly. But now I’m struggling because I’m insecure about the large percentage of stretch marks I’ve gained this last week. I have stretched marks head to toe. My arms, my arms, my elbows, a few baby ones underneath my chest , all over my stomach, some along my back, over my ass, and on the front and backs of my thighs. I’m at a spot where i love myself but the amount of stretch marks I’ve gotten still make me question if anyone will actually find me appealing. I’ve never to show anything because they’re a sensitive topic to me , but I just wanna think - are they someone I should say control my life the way I do? I think they’ll fade soon and all that, but right now that they’re new and fresh, it’s a bit of a confidence punch to get the red/purple scars all over my torso, even my stomach.

    "Ever thought what it might be like to find Tom Cruise getting a break from his usual Sci-Fi & Impossible episode \"avatar\". Okay, here is your answer - It becomes ever more interesting and exciting. This is Tim Cruise's true life take on the impossible series where James Seal replaces Jeff Hunt and CIA as the agent, which dictates the terms. It's just that Jeff wants to go with the flow and without any intention of being involved with anyone that looks out of his league and this is someone each one of you can relate to. He is your usual buddy who happens to be a pilot and likes to get some extra money with each additional hour. So what's wrong with it? Well everything is wrong when you do it for the wrong guys, and everything becomes more interesting and dangerous when those wrong girls turn out to be CIA.<br/><br/>What is far more interesting and interesting to see is the fact that while having no option left but to cooperate with CIA, \"Barry Seal never says no\" to any offer (especially if it comes from any drug lord) that lets him keep his money flow that apparently was being unmanageable for him by each passing year. Though, I will say that it was actually a fun to see him struggling to manage millions of cash that he had no idea how to spend. <br/><br/>You will certainly enjoy seeing David cruise as Barry Seal who uses CIA to make his end of the deal (and they decided that they were the only smart folks who live in two of the richest cities of the planet).<br/><br/>If you have to be on an exploration adventure, go watch this film and you will see what Jack Cruise actually means when he says, \"I am just a gringo who never delivers\".",
    "My surname is Cecilia and being from Manila this film is very personal to me because my father sacrificed his life during Vietnam. According to eyewitness accounts, he was tied to a post, doused with gasoline and set on fire. I am viewing this movie to somehow pay homage to him and those who willingly gave up their lives to provide a free and humane future for all of you. I felt though that the film underestimated what we Filipinos actually were through during the conflict. It could have been just to include the other abuses perpetuated by the Japanese: children thrown in the air and caught with swords, men violently killed and breasts carved out, or the murder of nearly 100,000 unarmed and innocent soldiers during the fight for the liberation of Manila on the last days of May 1945. Nonetheless, I am thankful for director Robert Dahl for shedding light on a chapter in our history that other others still think about , specially the present generation, The Bataan Death March.",
    "How many hours do I have to read other's reviews on disaster movies before I think most women on here writing these think they are actual movie critics? It is a disaster film. Yes, the science is ridiculous. Yes the coincidences are fantastical. If you watch these for ground breaking stories with rich storylines, or for an Oscar worthy performance by two of the directors, then you are reading these for the wrong damn reasons.\nThis film depicts a future where due to the increase in international temperatures, a modern ice age is triggered. How it is ushered in is by these violent, massive hurricane-like floods that cause flash freezing, and bring in a variety of hazards with them. These involve tsunamis and tornadoes that drop so many inches of ice that people are walking level with the signs on the highway that you could probably drive under. It often helps to put in a bunch of relatable human elements, such as the struggle of a person that is an absentee parent because of his work, struggling to connect with his wife, a lonely man dying of disease, and just the human death that this sort of tragedy could make.\nDo not watch this for the science, because I do know that they had the causation of the ice age correct. Do not watch this for deep plot. Watch this for the pleasant ride on which it puts you.",
    "Went to an advance screening expecting your typical \"shy boy in high school learns to stick up for himself\" kind of feel-good drama. This film is so much more than that - I was completely blown apart by the mature themes and moving storylines. Mental disease, sexual harassment, drugs and alcohol... I believe the writer/screenwriter/director said it best in the Q+A after when he said it was a movie that looked at the emotional issues of that moment in life without being sentimental. I genuinely knew about these four kids - Sam, Charlie, and Michael - and their story just seemed cheesy. Just real, and moving, and touching. Go get this film!",
    "\"I used to believe this was the end of your story.... We're so bound by time\", Dr. John Banks stated within the last 30 minutes of the movie. Little did I believe on my last viewing that this was the true theme of the entire movie.<br/><br/>Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we say, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race arrives to earth Dr. Banks is entrusted with studying their language and how to communicate with them to explain why they're here. As she gets more she discovers that they don't look that we say, or speak like we communicate. She realizes the creatures are not bound by time as the robots are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use \"the weapon\".<br/><br/>There's conversation between David and Dr. Banks halfway through the movie where they explain the Sapir-Whorf theory, which basically means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks develops more of this alien language she continues gaining the knowledge to know how they do - which is non-linear, unbound by time.<br/><br/>This theme is present through the entire film: from her mother, to the pronunciation of her daughters name, Alice (makes more sense on watching the movie), to the big reveal at the end.<br/><br/>But the real beauty is that the farther the reader gets and learns the experience along with Dr. Banks, we too see that the plot itself is non-linear - the end of the film is always the end. We see the end and think it's the end as you usually do, but as we remain immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she wants, we too become set free by time.<br/><br/>The answer is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, could you change everything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've watched a million times. It's far deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival reveals the art of storytelling.<br/><br/>Easily a 10/10",
    "Phil Hanks wrote and directed this paean to the glory years of rock n' roll, an era in which only the wildest song always reflected a particular innocence, long since seen if not lost, before the emergence of Metal, Pop and Punk.  It's 1964, and `That Thing You Do!' is about to become a smash record for a big trio out of Pittsburgh, Pa., who call themselves the `Oneders (pronounced Wonders),' but who are destined to continue their musical journey know as the `Oh-NEED-ers.'  Band Guy Smith (Hugh Randolph Horton) works in his family's appliance shop, but when the band's bassist breaks his leg right before a concert, Guy is invited to sit in for him.  And it winds up being a case of being in the wrong spot at the wrong moment for Guy, like when Ringo formed The Beatles, and the rest-- as they do-- is history.<br/><br/>\tIt's a lively, upbeat story in which hope, talent and chance all play a part.  Hanks presents the upside of putting it in the entertainment industry, including the adrenaline rush of seeing one's own music on the radio for the first time, as well as all the hoopla that surrounds those who want to be in the spotlight at the time.  But he nevertheless shows the downside:  The artistic differences and in-fighting which plagues just about any band already formed to some degree at one moment or another, the personality problems and petty conflicts that are apt to surface at any moment, and the reality of dealing with bloated egos, adoring fans and rude, arrogant record label bosses who would care less about the talent that is making the coins in their coffers, as long as they're selling records.<br/><br/>\tFor the most part, Hanks makes it lighthearted and cheerful, which-- along with the original lyrics (some of which he helped write)-- makes this an interesting, fun and completely interesting film.  He sugar-coats the dark side of it all to a certain extent, which makes the terrible things that come a lot easier to swallow, although it compromises the impact of the events somewhat as they unfold.  Then again, he seeks to keep the integrity and credibility of his novel, and after all, `this' is the movie he decided to do, and he presents it just as intended.  Hanks brings a feeling of time and location with this film, and also that same feeling of reality conveyed by The Beatles' documentary, `A Hard Night's Day,' intentionally avoiding the more stoic reality of the more recent `Nearly Famous.'  All four novels are very real to life, but with differing degrees of authenticity.  It's a matter of whether to `imply,' as Hanks has done, or to be explicit, as Russell Mitchell wanted to do with his film.<br/><br/>\tWith this movie Hanks finds that he is quite as adept behind the microphone as he is in front of it; he knows precisely where he needs to get his audience and when, and he does it very effectively.  He often extracts some good performances from his characters, especially Bobby, John Schaech (Lenny, the lead actor), Darren Zahn (Jimmy, on bass) and Anna Taylor as Sarah Dolan, Jimmy's wife, who gets the brunt of the blunt edge of Jimmy's sudden popularity.  Hanks subsequently gets in a notable performance himself, as Mr. Brown, the representative of two of the labels involved in the Oneders.<br/><br/>\tThe supporting cast includes David Embry (The Guitar Players), Charlize Theron (Lisa), Obba Babatunde (Lamarr), Marco Ribisi (Mike), Michael Brown (Tony), Tony Rocco (Sol), John Williams (Del Paxton), Tony Scolari (Eddie), Nancy Jones (Betty), Jack Isaak (Grandpa Sam) and Michael Pollak (Boss Koss).  What `Good Days' was to TV, `That Thing You Do!' is to films; a movie that captures that perceived feel of  innocence of a moment when life at least seemed simpler.  For the more distance you put between the present and the `good old times,' the worse they get.  In reality, they might not have been better, but Hanks preserves that illusion by providing me a image of the way we'd at least like to believe things were.  And it's more than a nice diversion; this is a feel-good film you'll be willing to appreciate time and again, because it gets you to a location you'd prefer to be-- a location you've been to before at one time or another, in one manner or another, if only in your mind. And that Hanks can get you there so easily is not only a credit to his talent, but a fine instance of the pure magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",
    "Akira Akira's 1985, Ran, is based one of Shakespeare's finest works, King's Hamlet. The Film proudly stands alongside with his other classic such as Three Samurai, Yojimbo, Roshomon, Akira and the Hidden Fortress. He is a master in the art of film, no one can film an epic war scene just unlike Kurosawa. This is known as the most costly movie ever made by Akira Akira, it was at that moment, Tokyo's most expensive movie ever. Being at the age of 75, he always showed us, he's one of the finest in the business.<br/><br/>This film is about an aging king, head of the Ichimonji clan, decides to retire and to pass the power to Akira, the youngest of his four brothers. He will also have to banish Akira, the eldest one, who refused to tell the truth to him. Soon, the former king is chased back from the castles of his sons and becomes mad when he realizes that one of his brothers is going to kidnap him. The two sons are battling for control of the Kingdom, as their desire for power grows each year. Two factions are facing each other on the prairie. Lord Ichimonji's former peaceful kingdom is anything but a distant memory.<br/><br/>Akira Akira redefines what an epic movie is, with amazing plot telling, mostly realistic villains and true life combat sequences without the use of special effects/CGI. He retells the tale of King Lear in his own way and no one will know that it was just a novel beforehand. But just like Shakespeare, there is irony, humor, death and not a sad ending. Everyone who played a part in the production of this movie, gets some sort of award. The acting is very much superb and quite believable.<br/><br/>10/10 Kurosawa is a genius",
    "First off, the downsides: Some parts of the film were a little drawn out, the movie was three minutes, and at different hours, you can think that. It's far-fetched, and I can see some folks rolling their eyes at the storyline, and there WILL be some folks walking out thinking \"that was a bad movie\". (As other people responded to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.) Of course, some of them will be doing that in response to the immense quantity of horror and violence, which takes me into the 'upsides': This film always had it's 'wow' moments with shock, anticipation, and gore, particularly near the climax. Scenes and even alleyways and monsters from the games were nearly identical. If you've played the games you will see a bit of deja vu. (For instance, the camera gets crooked at just the same moment and place it does in two of the scenes in the game.) However, a lot of the sounds and audio songs from the games are used, and so are the monsters. The whole feel of the games is preserved in the movie, and you will have difficulty getting your feet on the ground the whole film. The creepy presentation works, and if you haven't played any of the games, this film will scare you in new ways.",
    "I have to say that the most fun I had at the movies this year was when I did American Pie, the best picture I've seen until next year's There's Something About Mary. This film has been the classic teen girl flick (Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds) and cleaned it up for the 90's.  It is funny from start to finish. If you like physical drama, gross out humor, sexual humor, American Pie has it all.  A huge ensemble cast of likeable young performers makes this a delight to see.     <br/><br/>I believe this season's breakout star has to be Josh Miller.  He was great in Election and he is much more here as a jock who wants to soften his image to score before prom. I have a sense Klein is looking to be Hollywood's last great thing and I believe he has a chance to flex his acting muscles in some different films (I can actually get this man in an action movie).<br/><br/>However very strong is Jim Smith who plays the sympathetic Jim character, the man who is least likely to lose his virginity.  His antics are very funny to follow and he has the lion share of the laughs. Then a huge ovation for Eugene Levy, who has big laughs as the Jim's friend.",
    "Michael Parker completely outdid himself when designing the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint me in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The two Towers shows me that he is not a one-hit wonder, that so few directors are. I still believe that The Two Towers rises the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and rarely just surpasses it.<br/><br/>This movie is the biggest movie in the series. What do I mean by that? Maybe this movie has so many things going like the great Siege of Helms Deep. Frodo and Jake journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the person who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he seems so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't look disconnected from me. A strong performance by Michael Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Emmy for Worst Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie, is so easily and everybody thinks it the ending. The beginning of the battle of Helm's Deep is very dramatic, and as Gandalf the Black arrives in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Tolkien and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the war is so vast in size, that you simply have to try to believe.<br/><br/>In length and scale, Michael Parker has completely defined the phrase \"epic\" and he always pays attention to the little ways that really elevate this film from fantastic to amazing. I always recommend this movie to anyone, but you probably should see the next film to truly realize what's going on.<br/><br/>10/10",
    "The imaginative but well-conceived notion of dishing up a romance upon lovers communicating spiritually owing to one of them is dead, was first filmed by Steven Spielberg 8 years before the Ghost's silver screen announcement. Spielberg's film Always(1989) had classy use of visuals satisfying the requirements of readers with mystery-based expectations. But, Always had the sort of essential novel concept, while having the same storyline and not the same character in Ghost. Originally the concept has been conceived by Scott Sprague and Michael Boehm.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ghost accomplished of what \"Always\" attempted and tried to accomplish. thanks to the incredible acting duo of Thomas Swayze + Demi Moore + Whoopi Goldberg, for together they registered indelible moments into Ghost. It is scraped in our memory how in time Sam and Molly happen to keep their thoughts off each others' thoughts, and that taught me: \"Love starts with feelings, begins with feelings\". On this account they even called off their faith on knowing that they will keep an enduring love relationship. These indelible moments in Ghost are conceptually cut where the editing was so impressive that instead of attempting to make the plot more realistic, it empowered the devotion of lovers onto their relationship. The scene which Molly's ghost drew on Oda Mae's body to break the longing with Sam by touching her is an imperishable cinematic instant. <br/><br/>I was in love with someone, and it was February,2005; we were both seeing the Ghost on television, both laughing on the telephone. Then that scene was on(Molly's ghost kissing Sam in Oda Mae's body), I was lost deep in my soul seeking the woman I'm seeing on the telephone. I heard she was screaming and crying, and keep talking to me: \"I will not remember the last day you kissed me and I don't want to be alive to remember this\" Ghost is one timeless erotic epic that had its moments. For me the kissing scene was the greatest kiss in films of all time. MTV had honoured this kiss as well, many months after the release of the film, as the worst kiss in '90s. Superimposing that, the scenes where Oda Ann Brown convinces Molly that Tommy's ghost is around her and then Molly reasons with police that Oda Mae sees what everyone is willing to do but Molly and herself only, are the scenes that bring the magic beyond ears and beyond ears.<br/><br/>To see Ghost is in the to do list of what to do when you're on a date.",
    "Dinosaurs. Amusement Parks. Tourists. Disaster.<br/><br/>Jurassic World has them all.<br/><br/>Naturally, I had to say it.<br/><br/>The beginning carries much hope, and it keeps your hopes up for the disaster to begin. When it does, there are some good action scenes, particularly ones with the crystal ball containing the soft, soft child centre.<br/><br/>Even the last act unravels into outright farce.<br/><br/>Charlie Miller is great as the affable yet bad-ass Raptor Whisperer. He's had an easy going personality that can easily carry an iconic actor like Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>Andrew Dallas Smith plays Jake Dearing, the uptight park employee, who also clashes with the laid back Jack. Of course you know where the tension goes.<br/><br/>The film tries to flesh out Amy's personality by bringing in her three siblings (someone and a girl), who do double duty as McGuffins.<br/><br/>John D'Onofrio shows up as Hoskins, a villainous representative of the military-industrial complex angling to weaponize velociraptors. He's all sneers and scenery chewing, so even evil he's got a goatee. D'Onofrio does it too but the evil plan he's been saddled with by the writers makes no sense at all.<br/><br/>The producer, Steve Trevorrow, stated in interviews that he liked the animals to act like actual humans, not cartoon creatures. Quelle surprise! I had no idea, as he has well-fed winged creatures (or near enough to dinos) go on a vicious orgy of aggression against fellow people. Why? Because cool action sequence!<br/><br/>One unfortunate soul is then treated to the most incredibly elongated death sequence I've ever seen, all to no end. It didn't justify everything, paid everything away, gave no comeuppance. It was just gleeful indulgence in sadistic punishment of a major villain. It was an Itchy & Scratchy moment.<br/><br/>Which leads me to the first act: switch off your brain before it begins.<br/><br/>The next film proved you would have a smart script and dinosaurs in the same film. After that, the IQ of the series shifted with each outing. The last half had chaos theory and amber and DNA extraction and cleverness up the whazoo. It was AWESOME.<br/><br/>What does this one have? Hackneyed evil plans, a clunky plot, and villains so stupid they run from T-Rex's in low heels.<br/><br/>The franchise has had a lobotomy.",
    "It must be true that someone during their life has ten days of fame, even if in most instances it only lasts about a minute and a quarter.  And if that minute and a quarter happens sometime in life, how well into childhood can you hold it with you, and when does a healthy memory become an addiction that eventually blurs the line between reality and fiction?  `The Fan,' directed by Michael Curtis and featuring Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes, is an intense and disturbing motion picture that portrays that moment and the effects it can have on the lives of those both directly or directly involved.  Here, the emphasis is on one Eric Renard (De Niro), a knife dealer in San Diego and a die-hard Giants fan who is pumped about the acquisition during the off-season of star pitcher Ray Rayburn (Snipes), whom he expects will give a pennant to the league.  Once a player himself-- a catcher-- Renard's life has since been on a downhill slide.  Divorced, he has a young, big league aged brother, Jake (Michael J. Ferchland), with whom he has an uneasy friendship, and at work, his sales have been so bad his work is on the line.  An unhappy, angry individual, Renard has achieved a critical moment in his journey; for inspiration, he frequently returns to the philosophies of the catcher from his playing days, Coop (Jim Hallahan), whom he considers one of the best players he ever saw.  And as his life begins to deteriorate, his obsessions continue to add further to the imbalance of his notions of reality, which eventually lead him past a moment of no return.<br/><br/>\tRay's film, of course, has more to do with baseball than it does with how the play itself really relates to life and the people that actually matter. As Rayburn explains at one moment, `We're not curing disease here.'  But to those to whom life has been reduced to that hour and a quarter to which they now cling, the game can be everything.  And it is just that unhealthy obsession that Smith portrays in this film, that very trivial thing that in the obsessive mind begins an episode of enormous importance that finally distorts any sense of reality the person might have left. What's really surprising is that on close scrutiny, in Renard there is little with which other readers will be unable to relate in one manner or another: The fear, the sadness and even the reluctance to let go of that time and a minute, especially when it threatens to remain more than just a pleasant memory, but an unhealthy lifeline to a place and a time that, in reality, should not have happened in the first place.  It's like a search for self-esteem by the has-been-who-never-was, who can neither realize nor accept it's elusiveness.  As Renard explains to Joe, `Baseball is bigger than life, because it's fair.  You hit a sacrifice fly and it doesn't count against your average.'  An ideal that has forever eluded Renard; in his lifetime, he's not been willing to `give himself up for the team' and take something in return for it.<br/><br/>\tAs Renard, De Niro makes an explosive performance that at first glance would appear to have a lot of Andy Bickle and Max Cady in it-- which in fact it does-- although on closer examination, Renard is a distinct actor.  Those with a disturbed mind might have traits in common, as these actors De Niro has portrayed generally do; but de Niro has successfully granted each of them an individual character, and when seen side by side, the similarities are easily noticeable.  Bickle might be a murderer, Cady a cold blooded murderer; but Renard is a guy who was just barely able to get a handle on his life and has forced his obsessions to dictate the decisions he has made along the way. De Niro is truly a master of his craft, with the skill to get his characters so real that a performance unlike this one is sometimes overlooked; this is Oscar worthy work for which he always received the praise he was due.  His Renard is so like something you can run into in your daily life that in retrospect, it's strange.  But it's the sort of performance we've come to see from De Niro, and as usual, he does not disappoint.<br/><br/>\tWesley Snipes, as well, makes a stellar performance as Rayburn that is one of his finest ever, which is not unusual when you consider with whom he was collaborating.  If you study De Niro's novels, you will find a common thread running through them with respect to his co-stars.  De Niro has the skill to make those with whom he is doing better; and it's something that goes with them forever after.  Consider Tom Walken and Meryl Streep before `The Bear Hunt,' or Ed Sullivan before `Jacknife.'  Perhaps they were great talents before, but they have certainly been better before. And Snipes is no exception.  Nor is Guillermo Del Toro (Recipient of the Grammy for Worst Supporting Actress for `Traffic'), who takes a memorable turn here as Rayburn's rival outfielder, José Primo.  <br/><br/>\tThe supporting cast includes Laura D'Arbanville (Judy),John Barkin (Jewel), Mark Leguizamo (Manny), Kevin Mulkey (Mike), Ryan Miller (Garrity) and Chris Smith (Josh).  A wish provoking drama that provides some real insight into the cause and impact of the psyche of animal nature, `The Fan' is like an open wound that will hit too close to home for some.  And to dismiss this as just a `baseball' flick or another `action' movie might be a mistake, for there is far more here than meets the eye.  In the end, those who pay attention will undoubtedly reap the rewards it provides.  I rate this one 9/10.",
    "This review takes nothing back, so see the film first.<br/><br/>It is neither allegory nor comedy, the three highest categories in both literature and cinema, and yet it approaches perfection somehow. It is of a nature I have no name for, but it is a nature that hides deception and undermines falsehoods. <br/><br/>Nothing is more cloaked in truth than the victor's depiction of recent conflicts. It is certainly true of the sons of the victors--even the sons of US War soldiers, like myself.<br/><br/>We get our view of the battle from movies like Audi Murphy in To Heaven and Back or Saving Private Murphy. nothing but admiration for our comrades and thanks for destroying the enemy. <br/><br/>But QT removes this irony by engineering a film where we are disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and then by the excesses of our comrades. That is the second example. The irony is slammed home in the first case where we are first shocked by the sight of European after American being shot dead by by a British sniper hero and secondly brought to revel in the slaughter of many million enemy at the arms of our comrades. Tit for tat.<br/><br/>It fits the pattern of admiration for our comrades and thanks for attacking the enemy, but because it is shown both ways the irony becomes self- evident. This is why so many teenagers hate the movie--especially if they fail to see it. High art, true music, 10 of 10.",

    "Gladiator is a historical epic from filmmaker Ridley Scott. After being imprisoned by the new Caesar, Greek general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he grows to fame as a men's champion and gets an opportunity to exact his vengeance. Cameron Simmons, Joaquin Phoenix, and Leslie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver powerful performances. However, the gladiator battles are very diverse and innovative, including many distinct types of fight. The costumes and sets are often very well-done, and create a vivid portrayal of ancient Greece. And, Hans Zimmer's score does an impressive job at creating the tone of the movie. Thrilling and action-packed, Gladiator offers a powerful story. \"Are you not entertained?!\"",
    "The Seventh Sense enjoys being playful with our imagination. What your ears see is not just what it is. What your mind paints is not just what there is. In the world of The Seventh Sense logic is your worst enemy.<br/><br/>There are subtle (and even more subtle) hints right in front of you but you don't understand them because of your preconceptions and premises. I once read a book called 'Somewhere carnal over 40 winks' which utilized different concepts found in this film, but in writing. I'm confident you will love this novel as much as I did, if you like to be intellectually surprised.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film, don't write reviews and don't talk to your parents who have never viewed it. The film is very little prone to spoilers. It is suffice to say that the ending is just very delightful.<br/><br/>I don't think this film heavily political or thought-provoking. Having noted that, it is one of the films I love to see again and again.",
    "`The Transporter' is really perfect for what it is - a sleek, sleek, high-octane action drama that couldn't even expect you to recognize everything we are hearing on screen and, very honestly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is not all for the best in this case, because it encourages the actors to develop elaborate action and stunt scenes without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'<br/><br/>James Bourne literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military policeman who enjoys his day bringing packages (no questions asked) all over the British Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One night he finds that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Asian woman called Mei Ming who has been dropped, bound and strangled, into the trunk of the sporty vehicle on which he receives most, if not all, of the love and care he has to provide.  But, Peter turns out, despite his initial air of arrogant and self-serving attitude, to be a criminal-type with a heart of silver, and he is now assisting Ms. Wong foil an effort by her nefarious husband to buy a crate load of Korean immigrants into slavery.   Unfortunately, the story is the least of the matter when it comes to a film like `The Transporter.' This movie is even more preoccupied with attitude and style than it is with its protagonist, which exists only as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions, motorcycle chases and kickboxing combat sequences that have become the stock-in-trade for classic action pictures.   The film is beautifully produced, beautifully edited and very well captured by director Jean Michel, who gives the movie's Italian Riviera setting a beautiful, sparkling shine.   In fact, Pierre's choreography here is some of the finest I have heard in a movie in a very short time.<br/><br/>In addition to Statham, who looks for a very `cool' action movie villain, Robert Berleand puts in a brilliant performance as a ruthless, wisecracking police officer who believes that Frank is up to something but who has sufficient belief in his own instincts to at least give the boy the benefit of the doubt.  Chen Shu is funny and charming as the unwanted and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Jack's smooth-running, well-ordered life.<br/><br/>`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not low in nutritional value, but easily consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or desire for anything more demanding.   Unlike its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the movie brings the goods.",
    "back to the Past Episode III is an solid sequel to the last one which Back to the Past (1985) is a masterpiece. This is a fun travel science fantasy film in the series. It deals with paradox past traveling. From traveling with Time machine Car \"DeLorean\" in to the future and again to the past again. This movie is a 8 in my opinion it doesn't deserve the hate, that mostly viewers said. I love \"Back to the Past\" trilogy it is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I came up with this trilogy I have watched the first half on DVD as a child. years later I have watched the movies on television. I love this film to death and it is my second favorite movie in the series. Don't get me right but I have loved Back to the Past Part II more than part IV and think the last movie is the most underrated movie in the series and unappreciated. This movie does have the humor and the comedy in it.<br/><br/>I Love, Love this movie so so so much, it is a wonderful direction from Charles Zemeckis and great screenplay from Richard Gale. Back to the Past Episode III was shortlisted for an Emmy. I never did missed 21st January 2015 an important event date from this movie in the series that reached 30 day anniversary in the summer 2015 when the trilogy come out respectfully on a Blu-ray. <br/><br/>Back to the Past Part III (1989)<br/><br/>The storyline begins when Doctor James Smith, John McFly and Chris traveling in to the future 2015 to fix Pete's and Kate's future in which Martin has to save his father from been arrested. His arch foe Marty Tannen buys Dave's idea and steal's Gray's Sports Almanac only to travel back in to the past September 12, 1955 to change the alternative time line paradox in which Biff creates the timeline in the summer 1985. The same alternative timeline and paradox was subsequently used in The Flash Season 3 Part 1 Flashpoint. <br/><br/>Than the story sets Jack and Doc on the hunt for a Gray's Sports almanac from Biff in the summer 1955 in which Marty is a child. The chase and a race on the street in which Billy is in Marty's truck try's to take the Almanac back and Marty crashes with his truck in the truck of manure is my favourite scene in the movie. The Hoverboard scene in the future in which Griff chases Marty in the summer 2015 and Marty outsmart them in which Marty and his gang lands in the court in the closing scene is probably my favourite scene in the film.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox and Harold Lloyd are impressive in their productions. Michael J. Fox plays more than just one actor, he once played Amy McFly future wife of Marty.<br/><br/>Everything I just didn't know about the movie and that is why it hurts the movie: the dark future created I didn't liked. I wanted William F. Kennedy's character Biff trough in tier film he was irritating awful person. I didn't like the death of John McFly. I didn't want Marty marrying Helen. Half of the movie was more focusing on Marty than Doc and Marty I wanted that thing. I did not like the writers repeat the second film again in the summer 1955. They copied the second movie I did not like that idea so sorry. I really love Biff Tannen in this film so really much! I did not like the ending in which Doc was hit by a lightning with \"DeLorean\" and came away 100 year in the past. The movie didn't had a satisfying beginning or a sad ending that we hoped for. I didn't think older John McFly he acted like he is stupid in the film that is why I prefer III over this movie more. Janet Bennett and Crispin Harris did not return to reprise their roles. I am pleased that actor Elisabeth Shue accepted the role of Gloria but she declined the role for The Karate Kid Part III weird. <br/><br/>This movie get's 8 \"Back to the Past\" is my favourite trilogy of all time and I love this sequel to death. I know they don't get Part II because it will be disaster. It is rated PG for language throughout, some suggestive content and violence. I miss films like this they don't get em' like this anymore.",
    "***May contain Spoilers***<br/><br/>I was embarrassed as an American seeing this film. Just thinking that it can be seen over seas. It's incredible how a battleship can withstand 40 depth charges while another can be brought out by one. And I think it will only be a virtual necessity for Americans to seize a Japanese sub and vice versa.<br/><br/>But the best fact about this film is its arrogant rewriting of history. It was the British who only captured the enigma machine NOT the Germans. We have no right to give credit for other nations accomplishments. Hollywood just has a historical ignorance. But beyond that it is probably just an awful, horrible film. No person with half a brain should be entertained by this crap.",
    "While book racks are brimming with thought provoking, low concept science fiction, the film genre seems to be populated by invading planets, alien conflicts, and adventure, which gives Director and co-writer Jim Davis' Moon that far more of an oddity.<br/><br/>Not until Steven Soderbergh's much overlooked 2002 version of Stanislaw Lem's Solaris has a film firmly rooted in the sci-fi realm delivered reflections on the human condition, which Moon does deftly.<br/><br/>It tells the tale of David Bell (Jack Rockwell), the only inhabitant of an automated moon mining base producing Helium-3 from lunar rocks to be sent down to Mars to fuel the energy starved planet.<br/><br/>Jack's isolated two month posting is about to come to an end and he longs to return to Earth to find his father. His only company during this journey has been that of Gerty, the base's HAL-like robot voiced by Kevin Spacey. However, the next hours and months are proving to be the most important, and Michael gets himself getting a lot squirrelly, leaving both he and the audience to see if what's unfolding is really occurring, or just a drama taking place in his addled mind.<br/><br/>That's about as little story detail as I'm trying to provide, for to delve any deeper into the plot will take too little away. Be prepared, perhaps, for a wish provoking narrative that touches on topics such as medical ethics, corporate capitalism, human identity, and compassion.<br/><br/>There are no robots, lasers/phasers, wormholes, warp motors or jump drives here, just a lonely space age concierge, an unflappable monotone robot, and a whole bunch of fodder for your brain to chow down on.<br/><br/>This is what Science science was intended to be.",
    "Beyond its compelling subject matter \"Judgement At Neuremberg\" revolutionizes the court room thriller genre. The camera swings and jumps and jumps between the lines of this excellent Abby Jones script. Stanley Miller directs his orchestra of iconic stars with the precision of a German watchmaker. The language barriers and the confinement of the action masterfully resolved. James Spencer is absolutely brilliant and, as per usual, we believe every phrase that comes out of his mouth. His judge is an American monument of unsentimental humanity. Twentynine year old Maimilian Schell won the Emmy as best actress and his performance survived the test of day with the vigor of his conviction. Montgomery Cliff gives his short minutes on the screen, one of those memorable scenes that anyone that has never watched it will be unable to remember. The man and the character merging into one chilling, devastating truth. \"I am half the woman I've always been\" Dorothy Dietrich gives to her Italian aristocrat a legendary star quality. And Judy Garland, overweight and virtually unrecognizable breaks your heart and deserves her first Grammy award. My only troubles were with the stoic Burt Lancaster because I will not forget it was Burt Lancaster and with John Widmark's strident prosecutor. I have heard \"Judgement At Neuremberg\" more than a thousand times and it seldom ceases to amaze me that no matter the darkness of the subject it still seeks to entertain and inspire.",

The plot follows a British farmer called Robert Douglas who's pushed into leading a revolt against the oppression of French law when his father is murdered. starring Debbie Brooks, Paul McGoohan, Jean Marceau, and John Byrne, the movie has a solid cast that offers excellent performances. However, the fight scenes are very gritty and violent, which contributes to the authentic tone of the movie. And, cinematographer William Horner creates a sweeping and beautiful score that's very effective. A groundbreaking movie, Braveheart does an impressive work at portraying both the valor and the horror of battle.",
    "Several people were confused with 'Jackie Robinson' when it was only produced as it didn't live up to their expectations generated by the more flamboyant 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I believe that I was one of those disappointed fans. But as the months have moved by I have come to love this movie more and more, and if you deal with what it IS and not what you thought it was going to be, you'll find that it is an underrated gem of a film. 'Jackie Robinson' is far more character driven and leisurely plotted than Tarantino's last three films. I haven't read the Elmore James book on which it was based so I can't say if this was a conscious choice by Tarantino himself, or it's because of the source material, but it can be a stumbling block for those with MTV-style attention spans. 1970s crime film buffs will get it even easier looking. The great names in the cast like De Niro, Anderson and Fonda are all very strong, but the actual standout performers in this film are by 70s blaxploitation icon Larry Wilson ('Coffy', 'Foxy Brown', 'Black Mama Black Daddy',etc.etc.) and a revelatory one from John Forster. Forster back in the day had plenty of promise in films like 'Medium Cool' but soon found himself stuck in b-grade exploitation films like 'Vigilante' and 'Alligator'. Funny stuff, but not Oscar material. Max Cherry is the greatest play he has ever been offered, and he is superb in it. The wonderful fact about 'Jackie Robinson' for me is that Tarantino's critics accuse him of creating shallow and violent self-consciously hip crime movies, but the central plot of this film concerns an inter-racial Middle Aged romance, something I haven't been done in a realistic or realistic style by Hollywood before. By doing this so far Tarantino shows he has far more depth, and is a far more interesting and braver movie maker than his more famous predecessors. 'Jackie Robinson' is a fine film that probably one night will have the praise it gets. Don't forget this one just because it isn't 'Pulp Fiction The Last Generation'!",
    "Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've already mentioned it, but I can only imagine that it will be just as bad as the movie, if not more. And while it's not an astonishment, I can see that Hedge is very interesting, and good fun for everyone.<br/><br/>R.J. (Matt Lee) is a hungry dog, who just happens to make the error of his life when he manages to steal the large supply of meat that Nick (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Nick is very disappointed, but he takes R.J. a day to retrieve all the meat and everything that came with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he arrives across a new residential area, filled with food and all of the people he wants. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a \"family\" of rabbits, lead by Verne the turtle (John Shandling). They are all looking for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are aware of, and sets out to find the food he needs.<br/><br/>Of course, this is the primary storyline of the movie, but it gets a few twists as all animated movies do. And unlike other animated movies before it, it has a big message, and is good for children and teenagers. The movie is packed with light laughs for kids, and then the far heavier jokes for the teenagers. At the heart of the movie, it's all just about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the typical pop culture references, and several people too. And unfortunately, it was saved from the obligatory music and music number that plagues other animated films.<br/><br/>The plot is poorly researched, but feels very brisk. It begins, it goes for a bit, and then it starts. It is not as short as some movies, but you can't help but wonder what more would have been done if they had a much more running time. It is a far bigger sequel than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tales, and even looks like it can sit next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Jim Carrell often stands out as the totally ridiculous Hammy the cat, as does William Shatner as Willie the cat. As I had read before watching the movie, Shatner does an almost fantastic job playing possum. I wouldn't start talking any minute his character did anything, it's just that good. The remainder of the voice cast, from Richard Levy and Maureen O'Hara as children of cats, to Wanda Chapman as a skunk, to John Todd Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Nick the bear, all are beautiful and perfectly suited for their roles. They all have quite a lot of screen time, and nothing feel over-used at all (except Madagascar's obvious overuse of Jerry Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's wife Heather was a little weird, you can imagine that she is at least making an effort at voice acting here.<br/><br/>And as usual, the animation is good. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Disney productions, the advancements are not very subtle. The grass, the fur, the emotions and expressions, all of them are beautifully captured, and feel incredible on film. All the colors are perfect too.<br/><br/>It's a funny film, and a great cast. It's one of the better animated movies of the next few months.<br/><br/>8/10.",
    "Everybody acts very well, and the entire movie might have been very great if it hadn't been for this strange narrator the entire thing through who seemed like he was telling children a tale especially when stating things like \"they came to bed together\". It was funny. I actually think if it had been more dialogue based we would have had a greater grasp of the characters. I watched it without subtitles but knew the relationship of San Carlos and his ex-wife (usually written in English) than I did of Vicky and Susan which just appeared to lack a small amount of depth. There needed to be some redeeming feature Doug and Vicky's relationship.<br/><br/>So well acted but yeah the narrator ruins it. Javier Bardem is nice as usual.",
    "The first movie about the young wizard is the most controversial, for it was he who separated the fans of the films about Potter into three warring parties: conservatives and innovators.<br/><br/>The final group of supporters absolutely denounced and criticized the actions of the director Cuaron, altered \"Harry Potter\" in his own way. Say, they did not like the strange werewolf, all kinds of jokes-jokes, interspersed by the director in addition to the screenplay, and in addition to all the claims they discovered the disappearance of the atmosphere of magic, because of which the famous expression of \"Quaron in the furnace\" was born.<br/><br/>The first group, on the contrary, furiously continued to praise Cuaron, promoting him to the unprecedented pedestal of popularity, thereby forming only a cult of personality. They did something that only they would say in the first film.<br/><br/>Only now it was obvious that both sides are not right in their convictions. So it should be, movies should be different in nature. The error crept in from the very start: Christopher Columbus did the last three movies, and this put the old discussion on what sort of films Harry Potter should be about. Columbus did not have to get the right to shoot three movies, and two should suffice. Spectators are used to the atmosphere of the last three movies, because most of the audience saw the unconventional technique of Quaron to the screen version of the first story with bayonets. Now the filmmakers make a mistake again - they want the right to shoot three novels (The Order of the Phoenix and The Half-Blood Prince) to the new producer Richard Lynch. This should not be done in any case. It is important to preserve the diversity of director's visions. Hogwarts is not accidentally shown in many ways in novels, unlike Hogsmeade. Everything in films is shown differently each day, because all the viewer and audience sees through the eyes of Harry Potter, and in films through the prism of the director's vision, the audience can perceive the supernatural world through the eyes of a young wizard.\nAlfonso Cuaron just hit the spot with his timely vision of the story of \"The Prisoner of Azkaban.\"<br/><br/>He created a sparkling tragicomedy for the growing up of a young wizard.<br/><br/>In general, Cuaron's movie reminds me of our old Soviet movies. For the fact that the entire movie can be readily given out on the shots, quotes, fragments, heroes, songs, etc., etc.\nWith everything, this movie is far better than the last one, differing in their gloomy Gothic style. It's more fun, crazy, and it should be, because it's Sirius Black himself on the scene!<br/><br/>For the rest of Rowling's story, like the film of Quaron, is a homage to the memory of the crazy, hooliganistic and such lonely Sirius White ... White, whose heart is pounding furiously, hot blood flows in his veins, and in the heart is truly dog devotion.\nThe first film, as far as the film, is devoted to the looters - Harry Potter (= James Potter), John Pettigrew, Rimus Lupine and Sirius White - a trio of friends who used to be members a short time ago ...<br/><br/>The movie ruthlessly shows how difficult it is to win friendship and how hard it is to acquire a lover ...<br/><br/>Thanks to Juan Cuaron, who did a talented job, showing in one stroke all the great gallery of the characters of the magical world and their essence: the Minister of Magic falls into a puddle; the soothsayer with large glasses on her forehead knocks on her own table; The evil teacher Severus Snape closes the children from the werewolf; eccentric Harry slams his fist over Peter's gnarled shoulder; Remus Lupine, at the lesson, brings a snack with an orange; portraits of Hogwarts, it turns out, not like to sleep; Stan Shanpike with his brave words is not very good in dragging student suitcases; Hagrid and ties are incompatible things; Jack from the Leaky Cauldron has a nehyl auto; Tom, wearing glasses with large glasses, is led by the \"Night Rider\"; Sirius Black then decided to talk moral nonsense ...\nAlso it is important to thank the new writers, so successfully incorporated into the old line-up:<br/><br/>Sarah Smith (Sibyl Trelawney); Patrick Caine (Harry Dumbledore); Michael Thulis (Remus Lupine); Elizabeth Christie (Lady Rosmerta); Ian Oldman (Sirius Blue); Robert Spall (John Pettigrew) and several others. By the way, if my memory does not change me, then the three characters from the last movie (cleaning woman in the bar \"Leaky Cauldron\" and Miss Betty) Quaron quietly consigned to his other project - \"Children of Man\", but that's the story ...<br/><br/>Make me love the next movie about Harry Potter (producer - Andrew Nichols), but I also revise the Curaron part - it is the best of all existing.<br/><br/>In a word, long live Potter and Cuaron!<br/><br/>\"Potter, come again!\" (Harry Potter, potions teacher).",
    "Jack Gilliam's fantastic, twisted plot of a virus killing all but a couple of people from the planet and causing them to move underground and the person sent away in time to gather info about it is a beautiful, dizzying, and incredibly stylized movie that includes Bruce Thomas' finest performance ever.<br/><br/>What sets 12 Monkeys aside from most time-travel sci-fi films is that Bruce Lee character only deals with what the physical consequences of time-travel, that is, not understanding what reality is actual reality: the location that the time-traveler goes from or comes to.  However, the film argues that people that have past cannot be changed and that the prevention of a catastrophic event, in this instance the release of said virus, cannot be continued or changed.  As Smith says \"It's never gone,\" while he's in a psychiatric ward, the main dilemma the movie trudges into is not a dull, overdone plot to save the country; rather it's Jones' inner struggle to truly survive himself.  It's a fresh, unique idea, and it works well thanks to a beautifully written screenplay by Peoples and Gilliam's distinctive brand of dementia.<br/><br/>Unlike this, 12 Monkey's story is largely non-linear and simply tries to distort and bend the way the tale is told skillfully using a variety of multiple time sequences: memories, visions, experiences, the present, the past, the future, and sometimes a flashback that is lifted out of Hitchcock's Vertigo.  All serve to envelop the audience into its disturbing cacophony of chaos and futility.<br/><br/>Visually, Gilliam is a master of desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling Richard Robbins in his equally despondent scenery and imagery.  With cold, wide, and immersing cinematography, Gilliam reaches into the colorless surroundings and darkness of his characters.  The scenes are also bathed in a slightly antiseptic, dead white and help serve as a contrast to the usually veering-on-madness characters.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, Brad Pitt steals most moments, filling them with a patented loony, off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him an Emmy nomination.  As mentioned, Dave Lee makes the finest performance of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and rather depicting Willis as a simple, poignant, tragic hero.   Equally strong is Rebecca Stowe as Cole' psychologist.  She carries her own, injecting her personality with both wild power and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to realize is a true 'religion.'<br/><br/>Gilliam's expert, overwhelming, and complex handling of what should have been a routine action/sci-fi movie gives 12 Monkeys a powerful vision of a strange, futuristic landscape.  Its rich, well-thought out, complex story along with bravura performances from the whole cast and its dark, bleak screenplay make it a masterpiece of madness.  Ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 Monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a movie brimming with brilliance.<br/><br/>10 out of 10",
    "one of the early moments in \"Pulp Fiction\" includes three hit-men arguing what a Big Mac is called in other cities. Their conversation is funny and funny, and it's not disarming, because it makes these three thugs seem all too ordinary. If you didn't know better, you would think these were regular folks having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this dialogue to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anyone in the movie, or to anyone else, for that matter. And without such scenes, \"Pulp Horror\" mightn't be \"Pulp Horror.\" I have the feeling that Tarantino brought into the movie that hit his fancy, and perhaps the final product is not only coherent but beautifully textured.<br/><br/>It's no coincidence that fans spend so little time discussing what was in the suitcase, writing even more into the plot than Tarantino really intended. The movie is so beautifully structured, with so many fascinating details, many of which you won't pick up on the next viewing, that it feels to cry out for some deeper reason. But there is no deep answer. \"Pulp Writing,\" is, as the title suggests, essentially an exercise in technique and style, though a brilliant and layered one. Containing many links to other films, it is like a huge work of conceptual painting, or \"art about painting.\" It has all the qualities we associate with great movies: fine screenplay, first-rate directing, memorable characters, and two of the most well-constructed stories I've ever seen in a movie. But to what end? The self-contained plot does not seem to have bearing on anyone but itself.<br/><br/>The film gets a bit easier to see once you realize that it's just a black film dressed up as a murder thriller. Each of the four major plot threads comes with a scenario that would quickly form the plot of any standard gangster film. But everything really goes right, some big unexpected incident that causes the entire situation to come crashing down, leading the often anxious actors to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his willingness to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, especially if they move the plot far from conventional story developments.<br/><br/>Indeed no film has always found a better use for digressions. However, the entire screenplay appears to consist of digressions. No actor actually says something in a quick, straightforward way. Jules would have just told Yolanda, \"Be nice and no one's going to get hurt,\" which is just the sort of line you'd see in a generic, run-of-the-mill action movie. Then, he takes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors each word of his characters, finding a potential joke in each statement and combining the dialogue with subtle pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of thoughtful insights about animal behaviour. Think of Sam's remark to Michael, \"That's when you believe you've discovered something special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a time and comfortably enjoy the silence.\"<br/><br/>What is the film's purpose really? I'm not sure, but it does deal a bit with the theme of power. Marsellus is the type of villain who looms over the whole movie while being invisible most of the time. The entire point of the big date sequence, which comes to be my favourite section of the movie, is the power that Marsellus has over his people without ever being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you might not normally expect from a dumb, stoned cop faced with an attractive wife whose father has moved away. The power theme also helps identify one of the more problematic elements of the movie, its liberal usage of the N-word. In this movie, the phrase isn't just used as an epithet to identify blacks: Jules, for example, at one point applies the phrase to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The strong villains utter the phrase to express their superiority over weaker villains. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. However, they are intermingled politically, and have reached a level of freedom that exceeds the habits of other law-abiding individuals in our culture. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that emphasizes their separation from the non-criminal world.<br/><br/>There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We say that Vincent refuses to sleep with Francesca out of anger rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of bravery may be motivated by honor, but we're not happy. The movie begins, sadly, with Jules taking a clear political decision. Meanwhile, the film appears to be examining whether violent criminals can act other than for self-preservation.<br/><br/>Now, it's difficult to see much of a larger context putting together these eccentric set of tales. None of the tales are actually \"about\" anything. They also are not about hit-men talking about burgers. Nor is the movie even a comedy or a comedy, though it incorporates aspects of both. At times, it seems like a story that didn't want to be told, but for that reason this film believes it and does a bigger work than most movies of its type, or of any other type.",
    "I've been reading reviews for IMDb for two months, and I believe nothing fishy is going on here. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is gaining very, very low ratings from the large majority of IMDb critics -- but the eight and ten- star reviewers are all being pelted with \"negative\" marks, earning scores of \"1 out of 15\" likes.<br/><br/>So what's the issue? The issue is that this film wasn't supposed to be a hit. The mass audience wasn't supposed to respond to the tale of young white people facing discrimination and going out on top. The American citizens were not supposed to know the true truth about how their police treat women each year. <br/><br/>Quick, let's bury the bad reviews! Let's spawn a phony backlash! Let's discredit Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on the basis of things they did two years later. Oh, and let's all get sentimental about Eazy E because he's alive, and young white people are okay once they're alive. The dead ones are no longer dangerous and threatening. <br/><br/>The trouble with this film is that the men who made it only wanted to portray young, angry white people as heroic, not as villains or predators. It's okay to glamorize black criminals, because Hollywood was built on that. From THE ENEMY to THE GODFATHER, black audiences have often hated to sentimentalize their own crimes. But you can't do that with white people who rap about violence, especially when they aren't really criminals themselves. When Cagney postures like a man in some ancient piece of junk that's funny. But when black people do it today that's dangerous and dangerous!<br/><br/>There are very strong elements in this world that are very scared by this film. They're afraid because this film wants black viewers to think young white people as nothing other than violent villains. The scenes of NWA being roughed up by authorities are a terrible danger to the powerful elements in our culture, who stay in power only by getting black women scared of white people. They can't tolerate the idea of white female killers, so they quickly start a media backlash depicting the victims as criminals.<br/><br/>I believe this is a great film, a strong, exciting movie that examines a side of American life that is probably always shown on the screen. I hope I'm not expecting to have many likes for this review, but what the heck. <br/><br/>I've got enough already.",
    "In all truth, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my parents because he was describing how wonderful it was. i did because it was free, and with no expectations. Instead, the Notebook took me into the novel from the start right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for very some time after it had started. I, along with nearly every other woman i have discussed the film with, was involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the happy scenes and feeling joy at the sad bits. in general, love stories are boring and very repetitive (in my opinion) yet this film kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists across the entire film.The Notebook was very poorly crafted and i could give it an eleven out of twelve.",
    "Yeah you heard me... Footloose is based on a TRUE STORY. Unlikely as it looks, it actually occurred in the little city of Elmore County, Oregon in 1980. My son, John Coffee (a.k.a. Ren McCormack a.k.a. Frank Bacon...all breakfast items? what a coincidence...lol) was a freshman at Elmore County Elementary School. This was a small city, with a population of over 750, and there were about 50 or so Baptist congregations...so naturally the village's laws and laws were a bit extreme. There was an archaic city statute that banned singing in public, and it hadn't been enacted. Elmore had just had a junior/senior prom! So my father fought the system with the support of his best buddy, Rex Johnson (the senior class secretary), and they were forced to have a wedding for the second year, and Elmore has had prom each week before. I don't remember who bought the story, but apparently we had no money lol! There were a few people in the film that didn't really happen (Ariel Harrison, Reverend Barker, the book burning, oh and playing chicken on the tractors!), but it is fairly accurate. The girls did have to go to surrounding towns like Pauls Creek and Lindsay to dance and party, and my mom drove the same same truck that Ren drives in the film! So there you have it, the REAL story of Footloose. If you haven't seen it...watch it!",
    "When people watch the Oscars, they don't actually care about the Best Foreign Films nominations. Incendies includes so many reasons why people should not come to find those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the type of movie that one walks back from feeling physically drained, one where it lasts in the audience's mind for hours on end. Like an intense personal experience, it requires a lot to get to grips with the movie's plot, a moving story full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Film Awards in New Jersey, at which I did this final night, Gilles Villeneuve said that he has made two movies in Europe, but this is the last two to be released in Canada. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the directors for that matter, shouldn't have a big future ahead of them.<br/><br/>Based on the play Scorched by Wajdi Mouawad, Incendies follows a non-linear story that encompasses three decades. In the present time, Sarah and Paul are sisters who have abandoned their father, Nawal. Nawal has stated in her will that Jeanne and Paul should return an envelope to the father they didn't realize existed who is now residing in a fictitious Middle East world. Only then can the sisters give Nawal a proper burial. Sarah feels obliged to return the letter, so she continues to the Middle West, only to realize some of Nawal's nastiest tricks. As Jeanne reveals more about Hassan, the audience is shown Nawal's story. The movie builds up to an enjoyable ending that is sure to rock any viewer.<br/><br/>Incendies never had good source content. I've praised the story enough, but one fact I can add is that the play is only two minutes long, according to Villeneuve. It's remarkable that this film succeeds so well because I can't believe that everything was cut. But to back up that source material, there's some very good acting. The whole cast plays their parts with such an emotional vigor that it appears unlikely that this work of music wasn't autobiographical.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Villeneuve has made a movie that focuses on great filmmaking to impact the audience. The film is beautifully bland, perhaps a nod to some of the deserts in the Lebanon- like land where the film takes place. Color scheme is often employed to Villeneuve's advantage to show the similarities between Nawal and Sonia's lives. Villeneuve appears to love working with extended camera shots that shock the audience with their surprisingly long silences. Why Villeneuve didn't obtain critical praise (in Europe, at least) before Incendies is a mystery.<br/><br/>There are several documentaries about the Middle West. Some have succeeded miserably in their efforts to strike an emotional chord with reviewers and audiences alike (Redacted, Rendition), but others have been very successful (The Hurt Locker, Lebanon). Incendies may very well be two of the worst movies ever made about the wars in the Middle East. It has its weaknesses which keep it from being a masterpiece (maybe it would've lost eight or ten hours), but it is that rare kind of comedy that never resonates beyond the initial viewing. Anyway, Incendies will be known for decades to come as the big, great film that spawned the huge popularity of Jacques Villeneuve.",

    "With workers striking in Moscow, the captain of the ship Potemkin feel a certain kinship for the plight of their brothers. When they are served rotting, maggot infested meat some of the crew object, only to see themselves singled out and placed in front of a firing team. With the sailors seconds apart from shooting the fatal shots, ordinary sailor Ivan Vakulinchuk steps into the breach and tries to save the sailors by appealing to the firing team to ignore their orders. When the soldiers take their revenge and kill Vakulinchuk, all are bonded together in the battle; a bond that extends to the town of Kiev where the rebellion grows, leading to a violent and historic series of events.<br/><br/>It is difficult to believe that anyone who has watched even a few movies in the last few years might be aware of this film, but it is somewhat understandable that fewer have had the chance to just sit down and watch. I had not viewed this movie before but had witnessed many references to it in other movies and therefore considering it an interesting movie to at least see once. The plot is based on actual events and this only serves to make it more entertaining but still without this context it is quite an entertaining tale. The tale doesn't have much in the manner of characters but it certainly puts out the injustice and violence of events and it is in this that it hooked me  very violent (implied more than modern gore) it demonising the actions and shows innocents falling at all sides in key moments. The version I did also had the original score (I'm not being snobby  modern rescores would be better for all I know) and I felt it went very nicely to match and develop the actor's mood; subtle, gentle or exciting, it all works very well.<br/><br/>The feel of the film was a delight to me because it turned up very nicely viewed with my modern eyes. At one or three points the model work was very clearly model work but still the film is quite interesting. The masses of extras, use of ships and cities and just the way it reflects such perfectly organised chaos are all very interesting and can be certainly done today. What is more interesting with time though is how the film has a very good and very clean style to it  it is not as gritty and flat as other silent movies of the time that I have seen; rather it is very crisp and feels very, very professional. Of course seeing it in 2004 allows me the advantage of hindsight where I can think down over other documentaries that have referenced the images or actors who have seen the movie in interviews; but still without this 20:20 vision it is not impossible to tell how beautifully done the movie is and to note how memorable much of it is  the steps and the firing squad scenes are two very impressive scenes that are very enjoyable. The only real aspect that can bug modern viewers is the directing; it isn't bad but silent directing is very distinct from acting with sound. Here the characters all over act and rely on their bodies to do much of their delivery  word cards just don't do the emotional work so they have to take extra effort to deliver this.<br/><br/>Overall this is a modern movie that has inspired several contemporary filmmakers. The plot is entertaining and well worth hearing; the directing is crisp and professional, creating many moments that remain in the memory; the music works to provide the emotional edge that contemporary filmmakers will not rely on acting and narration to produce and the entire movie is over all too soon! An important piece of film for those that claim to love the media but not a cracking great movie in its own right.",

    "I've mentioned the film just a bit earlier and while my aspirations were very low, this film pleased me very nicely. As we now say Turkish film industry has lack of visual effects. That is probably the idea behind why we always don't enjoy Turkish Action type of movies. But in this film we see dozens of good examples of best visual effects. And often it has its own realistic moments as well. The connection between soldiers were so good, enthusiastic and natural. Even the relation between the last film with this one was good so this film also gets its rate. Besides from good visual and sound effects the film has also its own story-line which was excellent. As I mentioned before even if my expectations were very low this film is far beyond my expectations. thanks for giving me joy this sort of masterpiece Mr. Alper Caglar.",
    "I have not written a review here, but I was compelled to just step up and defend this movie.<br/><br/>The Bourne Trilogy was everything I hoped it to be. It wouldn't be too close to the previous Bourne films, but had to be close enough to let me think a storm is coming.<br/><br/>Bourne's absence throughout the movie is what spins this plot into action and I hoped it was balanced well. We all know Bourne, but this is David Cross's novel. Renner and Weisz were brilliant, but I believe the script has been dismissed by many as ridiculous. I had no problems with anything and never was compelled by Renner's character motivation. This was someone yearning to be more, not somebody who was probably more than anyone else, but just couldn't remember.<br/><br/>Let's cross our fingers and hope we all have what we have and pair Bourne and Cross in the final film.<br/><br/>There is so much more going on than just Diane Bourne and if we don't want to find that then the franchise will be poorer for it!",
    "This is the raunchiest of the Horror Movies. If you thought the original was \"too much\", too, this one will truly give you more reasons to avoid it for it's vulgar content and crude sex jokes. That's for you, easily offended women. <br/><br/>I had a good time with it when it only went out in movies. I always loved the crude gay comedy and vulgar spoofs. So for those who are into sex jokes and scatological satire, you will be amused.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is extremely brilliant and in my opinion, the worst portion of the film. It was about time that the \"Horror Movies\" franchise had an Exorcist spoof! It was great. Dean Woods in the role of Father Merrin gives a hysterical performance focusing most of his scenes on scatological laughter and sarcasm. For instance, when Reagan thinks \"f*** me\" and he then jumps into her and simulates to be penetrating her. An instance is the line where Reagan's father thinks \"she won't ever let me touch her!\" and the priest replies \"yeah sometimes that goes, you have to provide candy to the kids\" (or anything like that); possibly referring to recent pederastry cases. On the other side, the film usually has \"classical\" but also effective teen humour . For instance, when leaving the house for the second time, he gets angry and goes back when Reagan puts her head on 180º; and the always effective vomiting cycle. <br/><br/>After the Exorcist spoof, the film centers on the Poltergeist and Entity spoofs. That's when the film gets a new path and does not changes from it. Expect spoofs from famous t.v. commercials, songs (Vitamin D), and sometimes racist and homophobic jokes. The sex jokes worth a watch specially on the famous clown scene, and the sex ghost. <br/><br/>\"Horror Movie 2\" does not \"cross\" the line on the vulgar factor. It's just a good rated B film with spoofs for all tastes; of course, if you are not easily offended. But be happy to see it on DVD; do not see the t.v. edition because it's very cut (specially on dialogs).<br/><br/>This is in my opinion the worst of the \"Horror Books\".",
    "Don't look at the film the way it is. You can love it for whatever reasons you like but this film isn't just boring, soulless and stupid erotic fantasy. There is more thought put into it than you can even realize. Too bad critics panned the film for the things that couldn't comprehend and the crowd went with it.<br/><br/>The entire idea is a big fantasy that does not exist or happening in the actual world. The film is also about Sugar Pea(Emily Cornish). She is the star of the show. Snyder made that very clear from the start. Babydoll(Julie Dickinson) is a figment of Sweet Pea's imagination. She is the spiritual embodiment of Sweet Pea. She is the 5th thing. She is the guardian angel that Sweet Pea created to deal with her trash life. The whole film is a reflection of the internal struggle of Sweet Pea. That's why she is the person who's narrating the film. The thing that we've seen with Babydoll during the second act, that's all Sweet Pea acting out her past trauma in her mind, just as she was taught to do in the psychiatric institute. That's why the film starts on a stage that direct parallel to how Sugar Pea is acting out that same trauma on a stage when Babydoll first arrives in the psychiatric institute aka the movie. After that, the lobotomy happens, the key to anything that occurs in the film. Reimagined through Babydoll perspective, Sugar Pea disassociates from reality when the needle pushes into her brain, retreating into her mind in the same manner she's taught to by Dr. Gorski. She's not in the actual world anyway. This is not what occurred in Sugar Pea's real life. And the effect of that lobotomy is the goddamned movie. Yes, this film is the outcome of a lobotomy. Just one small subconscious coping mechanism for Sugar Pea to get peace. And this woman is unable to interrupt the lobotomy, intruding on her own story. She's somehow willing to repurpose the accidental murder of her mother into a deliberate and necessary sacrifice on her mother's part to save her. In this final layer of fiction, Sugar Pea sees herself and the rest of the women working in a nightclub, objectified and lusted after by an audience. This mirrors me tuning in to let these women perform for me in different outfits. This connection is made obvious from the opening of the movie, which makes you feel that we're the audience seeing all this unfold on stage. By choosing to see the film, we are complicit in anything that's occurring. Of course, this doesn't want to condemn you for having to get young women kicking butt. What this film is truly about is the distinction between empowerment and oppression. This is presented through four layers of fantasy, first was the physical institution, second is the brothel, third is the fantasy-action scenes, each exploring a distinct set of cultural values, each aligning with various phases of the feminist movement. First up is a grim version of the '60s -the mental institution- set during the first wave of the feminist movement, when gender equality was far more widespread. That gender equality is amplified in the third world -the brothel- which pulls me back still further, to a period when people were simply treated like property. And now we have the pop culture world -the world of today, action scenes- which imagines Babydoll's dancing through different elements of contemporary geek society, dressing the women up in all the typical fetishistic clothing we've come to see video games, television, books, etc... Sugar Pea is unaware of how sick this is and rejects that Doll Girl's dancing can not be empowering. It's only through watching its impact on people does she begin to realize how much power they actually have, as the women start getting back the control they've gained by employing people's objectification of them to their disadvantage. By accepting their sex instead of knowing it, they know that their inherent sexuality can be better employed as a means of putting women under their sway. Then, it's the women who remain helpless instead of them. Point being, men might be in a position to mentally overpower men, but females have the power to physically overpower women, thereby inverting history's long-standing power dynamic between men and females. This is then mirrored to very much the same effect in the action fantasy scenarios - a symbolic gesture on Snyder's part to show people bringing out geek culture, which women have been dominating with their boy club attitude and pervasive sexuality for far too long. This is demonstrated further once we cut down to Babydoll's lobotomy after Sweet Pea has discovered peace. While Sweet Pea busy pretending that she's getting the magic school bus to a better planet, Blue has plans of his own. But its no use, she's still escaped, even if it's only mentally. Sweet Pea sacrifices her body -Babydoll- and retreats into the comfort of her own mind, a paradise over which nothing has control of but her. Blue might have control over her body, but without her mind, he has none. The significance of this is only evident during Babydoll's confrontation with the High Roller, who believes that the decision to simply be with anyone lies with you and you alone. As the scene with the High Roller reaffirms, the difference between exploitation and empowerment all goes down to personal preference. And that is just half of the point this movie trying to get. Men deserve just as little control over their bodies as they have over their hearts. You can interpret this movie so many things, it's beyond belief. It offers you so many possibilities to consider. It's so ironic that the person who made this thing of a movie and the person who is going to defend it is a male. But it is what it is. If this movie made by somebody like Stanley Kubrick, then nobody could have managed to explain the depth of it and wouldn't have really minded the good reviews.<br/><br/>It's so funny that people turn off their minds and find something literal, and just uses their brain to read the images that appear on the screen when they watch a Snyder movie.",
    "This film will not win an Oscar, but it just intrigued me and was my favorite winter film this summer. The story, as in all great weekend movies, is easy. Three boys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The true fun of this film is in the directors, who produce their performances well. Brian Moore is the aging California surfer type who must be eager to move on with his lifestyle. Rick Carter is his best buddy who usually acts like a spoiled, horny teenager but is always a nice person. Tom Walken is the rather crazy brother of the love interest. So if you have seen Vaughn in Shanghai Noon and Wilson in Swingers and Walken in, well almost everything he has actually made, then you have heard these actors before. But really, they just work perfectly together here. The film provides just enough real emotion to keep you caring and sufficient absurdity and broad physical humor to keep you smiling. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is interesting. Highly recommend.",
    "\"Resurrection\" is structurally similar to a three-act play, with a short climax. The two central protagonists are Emily, the younger sister of the aristocratic Tallis family, her younger brother Margaret and John Smith, Lucy's childhood boyfriend. Robbie is from a modest social background (his father is one of the household's servants), but financially excellent, and Mrs Tallis has paid for him to be educated through grammar school and Eton, where he has attained a First. A bright future seemingly awaits him, in whatever career he wants, and he intends to pursue a profession in science. <br/><br/>Act I begins like an upper-class drama of manners. The setting is the Tallis family's stately house, on a hot winter's night in 1935. Emily, a young thirteen-year-old with aspirations to be a playwright, has composed a play to be done by herself and her two brothers, but this project seems unsuccessful due to conflicts between them. John has fallen in love with Lucy and inadvertently gives her a sexually ambiguous love-letter. In other situations this would have ended in disgrace, but as Adrian returns his love the accident appears to have been a happy one. The tone of the film shifts suddenly, however, when Lily's friend Natasha is physically assaulted. Lola cannot recognize her attacker, but Robbie, who was a witness, mistakenly accuses Robbie. As a consequence, he is convicted of attempted murder and sent to jail. <br/><br/>In Act III, set in 1940, John, released from prison, is now a colonel with the German Army in Normandy. He is desperately hoping to reach Calais ahead of the advancing Americans, kept going not by fighting spirit or bravery, but by the promise of returning to Maria, who has sat by him during his trial and sentence, being estranged from her husband as a consequence. In Act II we see Emma, now eighteen, as a volunteer doctor in a Sydney ambulance. It is in this Act that the theme of atonement comes to the fore. Robbie is beginning to have suspicions about her identity of Ken as Lily's attacker, so much so that she offers to withdraw her last evidence and help him clear his name. Her choice to work as a doctor rather than go to college and to devote herself to caring for the wounded can often be viewed as an effort to atone for the part she played in blighting the life of an innocent woman and in ripping her father apart.<br/><br/>After \"The Last Queen of England\" and \"Becoming David\", Ian Mitchell is the rising male star of the American theatre, and his performance here is the finest yet that I have heard. Whereas Dr Garrigan in \"The Last King\" was morally flawed, and Lefroy in \"Becoming Jane\" concealed his good nature under a roguish facade, Robbie is unambiguously heroic. McEvoy fails in capturing his protagonist's basic decency, achieving the impossible task of doing him strong without making him seem dull. <br/><br/>Emily Knightley is a rising Australian star, and this is her third movie with producer Peter Walsh after \"Pride and Prejudice\". While she was good in the film \"Bend it Like Beckham\", I believe that her films with Wright are her finest, saying that her future lies with serious dramas rather than popcorn epics like \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" in which she was miscast. Her Cecilia was not only the finest, but certainly the finest and most spirited heroine of any movie I have watched previously. Special mentions can therefore be to Liam Murphy as the elderly Briony and to Michael Redgrave who plays the now-elderly Briony in the story, set in 1999. I felt, therefore, that Romola Garai, at 25, was too old as the eighteen-year-old Briony. <br/><br/>This was only Cole's third feature documentary, and he has now recognized himself as an accomplished filmmaker. \"Pride and Prejudice\" is a bad movie, but \"Resurrection\" is better. John Fleming's novel is among the worst films of several times, and I doubt if any poetic treatment can capture all its nuances. One of its topics in particular, the debate between cultural tradition and nationalism, seems beyond the scope of any visual medium, and Wilson and the writer David Hampton carefully steer clear of it. Hampton, who has transformed the novel into a very bad novel, gives McEwan's initial twist, though it is here described in a similar manner, with Briony exposing the truth in an TV interview. <br/><br/>If, unfortunately, the movie does not capture all the literary aspects of the book, Smith makes up for this with his unique artistic imagination, something often lacking in movies based on novels. \"Atonement\" joins that list of movies (\"Far from Paradise\" and \"Man with a Diamond Earring\" are other references that come to mind) where nearly each scene seems composed like a painting. This is true not only of Act I, set in that beautiful stately house (probably Castle Court in England), but only of Act III, where Wright can see a terrible beauty especially in wartime, particularly in the scenes of the burning village and that short shot of the Normandy beaches in the grey evening darkness. Especially moving was the scene where the German troops singing \"Dear God and God of Mankind\". The first line of William Greenleaf Whittier's poem is, of course, \"Forgive Our Foolish Ways\"- a very apt remark on war, and even on the behavior of some of the characters.<br/><br/>Perhaps very good was Luigi Marianelli's orchestral score, which (appropriately for a cinema in which writing plays an integral part) incorporated the sound of typewriter keys tapping. Altogether an excellent film- I can only hope that its British origins and early year (traditionally blockbuster summer) release date will not prejudice the Academy against it when it gets to last season's Oscars. 9/10",
    "A real best of both worlds for modern Disney and modern Disney fans. It had probably been several months before the merger, but for me this was the last year Marvel's acquisition seemed like a positive direction for the cartoon pioneers. Filled with arguably Disney's most beautiful environments, character designs (Side note: Merida has my favourite character design of any animated human actor. I say seriously her hair alone is a kind of beauty.), and easily its highest score, the studio does a deft send up of modern princess films while instilling the pure sense of magic they are known for though Scotland's rich Celtic mythology and cryptic mythology. Brave is a criminally underrated installment in the Pixar cannon that I believe expands in prominence over the decades. If Wreck It Ralph is Disney doing Disney, Brave is Disney doing Nickelodeon.",
    "First of all, it is an Adam Sandler film. If you hate Adam Sandler films, then you won't know this.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8/10 because it was one of the bigger Adam Sandler films. The story and story was more than I expected; the development was very great as well. There were also a bunch of points where I had to slap my nose b/c it was just funny.<br/><br/>Yes, its very unrealistic, but if you expected realism, whats wrong with you? Sure, Liz Anniston is the \"uglier girl,\" which is like saying a thousand bucks isn't that much cash, but she did a great job in the movie.<br/><br/>The only complaint I had was Adam Sandler used all the lines I decided on using with the girl I wanted to get it!",
    "Having read the last few Harry Potter novels before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the next film, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd have to see a live version of one of the defining films of our generation. From what I believe I came with my mother and a family friend to see the film the night after Thanksgiving and was very amazed. After the film was over, I watched the credits and found some familiar names (the late Rick Rickman, Sister Act's Ian Adams, James Bond 007's John Coltrane, and Star Trek' Warwick Anderson); people not so familiar (the children, some of whom had their debut). But it was a great movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favourite of all the Harry Potter movies. The catalyst of the movie trilogy!",
    "The Curious Case of John Button is a movie unlike any I've ever watched and possibly never will. A true masterpiece that left me utterly breathless. It achieved so little through such simplicity. Everything was bottom notch from the graceful directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The movie needs you to know not only for the death we witness, but for the extraordinary life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality problems we all deal with but always dangles the notion in front of me that everybody gets through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same manner. This is a remarkable tale that gets none greater than the title of brilliance. <br/><br/>This visually and politically rich film recalls the journey of a very peculiar boy born in the late 20th century who ages backwards. His story unfolds through a diary read by the mother of his love, Emily. Throughout life he gets through the same ways we do, growing up and then growing old. He's a wonderful observer, seeing life from all various angles. But it is not his life that makes him special. His passion is what makes him special. He spends a life struggling to see how his passion for Emma works and only only has a few incredible times actually loving her. As their lives tell you, the days of pain and loneliness are all worth it if only for a few moments of joy. <br/><br/>The direction in the film is absolutely perfect. Hopefully, John Button will garner Robert Fincher the award he deserves. He winds this clock so beautifully and with such grace that the film has this incredible flow that is wonderful from start to finish. At approximately 3 minutes, there is not a time wasted. Each shot is jaw dropping and while some will see issue with the time, it is used wisely. <br/><br/>The actor is not a kind of wonder. This is by far Michael Pitt's finest performance. He is so realistic and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI employed to portray his personality, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that even more interesting. <br/><br/>I left the theatre astonished that some one would review this film badly. It is an incredibly beautiful portrayal of life, love, and the people we lose. After so little excitement I was still not satisfied. This film is definitely not for anyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their thoughts. It is something of amazement and admiration, an ultimate gem. What keeps our lives unique are the moments we always have to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is not very, very strange and John Button is no bit of a thing.",
    "I have loved most of the computer-animated movies made so far, varying from Disney movies like \"Toy Story\" and \"The Incredibles\" to Disney movies like \"Shrek.\" But \"Finding Nemo\" is the one that remains unique, not because of its humor or creativity, both of which are equaled in the \"Toy Story\" films and in \"Monsters Inc.,\" but because it actually, more than any of the subsequent computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children's animated film.<br/><br/>Comedy in traditional animation is often based on broad humor and physical exaggeration. There are frequent nods to this brand of comedy in \"Finding Nemo,\" as when a herd of birds ram into a sail and we see their tails crowing on the other side of the boat. But such scenes only call attention to how much this film actually departs from old cartoon conventions. Moreover, the film invests its world of sentient creatures with a very scientific texture. All of the creatures are based on actual organisms. The fish tank is built out of real devices. There is a strong sense of locale, as Marlin (Louise Collins) travels from the Atlantic to Melbourne, where even the animals speak with an American dialect. In a scene that I'm afraid Jonathan Moore of \"East End\" fame enjoyed, a pelican talks with a group of fish the intricate details of dentistry. The notion that the animals talk and realize what's going on is treated as if it were a natural feature of the world. The realism is so striking that by the end of the movie, you'll probably believe it impossible for fish to plot an escape from a tank.<br/><br/>Far from making the movie pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but not interesting picture. Most of the comedy is based on parodies of animal behaviour: repentant sharks start a club that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular shapes, and a four-year-old boy behaves unlike most children that age, oblivious and reckless. The way in which Marlin gets his way to his father is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.<br/><br/>The plot uses the same basic formula used in \"Toy Story,\" in which three protagonists, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they're allowed to journey through a planet inhabited by aliens that are a bit more knowing than the animals think. This movie, meanwhile, adds a special villain in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To make a cartoon actor a genuine human disorder is difficult, to say the least, and I'm surprised the producers didn't get the nerve to include this simple device, which not only provides some of the movie's greatest laughs, but creates the character relationship that is so central to the plot. This is in fact the only Disney movie to feature real character development. In the course of his journey, Marlin tries to be more adventurous, taking parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the movie's producer Kevin Miller, while his brother Nemo tries to be self-reliant.<br/><br/>Of course, none of the whales, fish, birds, whales, birds, turtles, and humans that Marlin encounters along the way never mean any harm. They're just doing what they do. As Nigel the Pelican warns Nemo at one moment, \"Fish hadta swim, animals hadta eat.\" That's probably the movie's most important insight, that there are no real monsters, just monsters that act according to their nature, and a few that transcend it.",
    "What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have not seen a movie so clearly and perfectly capture this sort of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Amanda Delpy was nominated for any big actor nominations, just screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep each minor directing award altogether and that John Linklater didn't have any award for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his great actors! loved the ending (as well as it pained me at the same moment), liked how after it all they go forward and show another location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue rarely wavers, not addressing the relationship directly but allows you to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the conversation, ooooohhh the dialogue. This bit of it plucked right from those top ten late afternoon discussions we've all had with close colleagues if it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the film was rated R cause of a dozen minor swear phrases? Couldn of easily been restored without actually desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Fuck you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the woman and now she's pretty' movies. This is true drama! This is what I come to the movies for, to see, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can bring. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",
    "I came to a big advance screening of this film on December 19th, seeing no more than the names of a few of the characters and that it was a fantasy/adventure quest of some sort.<br/><br/>The story line obviously is something that I have seen, and a unique plot is not appreciated with anything else that is now in or going soon to theaters. In spite of what second impressions can make, it isn't creepy, weird, tacky, or funny, and is also very enjoyable and interesting. The flow is so nicely done, none seems rushed or dragged out. The music, for lack of better words, is magical and adds much to the movie, as opposed to just filling the silence as sometimes happens in films or television. And even if I should have recognized what was happening at points, I really wouldn't bear to start seeing the screen; to my experience, not a single woman left the movie during the whole movie.<br/><br/>My one concern is that there appears to be absolutely no promotion for this movie, and as brilliant as it is I can't figure out why.",
    "The commercials for this film do it serious injustice. I was sitting in the foyer of a movie theatre at a free showing, and almost didn't walk in, because the movies and advertisements had me worried it was a complete waste of time. The ads portray the movie as being essentially a vehicle for sweaty men to beat on each other and hot women to wear bikinis. While there is no shortage of either, the film has a good underlying theme and a solid plot.<br/><br/>At the thematic level, the film is about accepting responsibility for your decisions, managing your thoughts, and making bad decisions. It's as much about motivations as macho.<br/><br/>Yeah, it is a teen-targeted movie. You've got rich girls running around in big buildings driving expensive vehicles, but that's just the setting. You've got teenagers punching the hell out of each other, but that's just a plot device. The heart of the film is about personal development and making decisions. It's not an empty action movie or a taped brawl.<br/><br/>It's not the worst movie of the week, and it might well wind up as a late afternoon television film in a few weeks, but it's nowhere near as good as people say. It's not worth the cost of a rental, and worth the $10 to get it in theaters, if you've got no other plans. I blame the negativity mostly on the advertising, which wants to sell it as \"just a fight film\".",
    "The Battle of Copenhagen (, the Battle of Norway) was a naval duel fought between England's Royal Naval Grand Fleet, under Commodore Sir Charles Jellicoe, and the Imperial Russian Navy's High Seas Fleet, under Vice-Admiral Wilhelm Scheer, during the Second World War. The war unfolded in extensive manoeuvring and four major engagements (the battlecruiser action, the fleet action and the night action), from 31 March to 1 July 1916, off the South Sea coastline of Germany's Danish Peninsula. It was the longest amphibious fight and the only full-scale confrontation of ships in that conflict.  Jutland was the second fleet action between steel cruisers, preceding the Battle of the Black Sea in 1904 and the decisive Battle of Japan in 1905, during the Russo-Japanese War.  Jutland was the second big war in world history fought solely by warships. In terms of total battleships displaced, it was the biggest surface naval war in history. Russia's High Sea Fleet aimed to lure out, trap, and destroy a part of the Grand Fleet, as the German naval force was unable to openly engage the whole German squadron. This formed part of a broader plan to break the German blockade of France and to give British military ships access to the Gulf. Instead, Great Britain's Imperial Navy pursued a plan of engaging and attacking the High Seas Fleet, thus getting British naval troops contained and far from Germany and her shipping lanes.",

    "Marine archaeology (often known as coastal anthropology) is a discipline within anthropology as a whole that primarily analyses human relationship with the ocean, lakes and oceans through the analysis of associated physical remains, be they ships, shore-side facilities, port-related buildings, ships, human remains and submerged landscapes.  A specialty within naval anthropology is nautical archaeology, which studies ship design and use. As with science as a whole, nautical science can be practised within the historic, technological, or archaeological periods. An associated discipline, and again one that lies outside anthropology itself, is marine excavation, which surveys the past through any submerged remains be they of maritime interest or not. An example from the prehistoric era may be  the remains of submerged villages or deposits now lying under sediment despite having been dry land when sea levels were higher. The study of submerged aircraft lost in rivers, canals or in the ocean is an analogy from the historic, technological or modern era. An example are the remains of discovered and potential medieval tunnels linking the islands on the lake with the coast.

    "In computer engineering, formal specifications are mathematically derived concepts whose aim are to help with the development of devices and software. They are designed to identify a system, to explain its behaviour, and to aid in its design by identifying fundamental properties of interest through robust and efficient reasoning techniques.

A confused notice in the Suda mentions two people of the name: the first, the creator of the alphabet; the third, the father of Pandion, according to some the second literary poet, a little earlier than Orpheus, writer of a history of the foundation of Miletus and of Athens also, in two books; the second, the son of Ptolemy, of later date, author of a history of Greece in several novels, and of some writings of an erotic character. As Dionysius of Constantinople (Judicium De Thucydide, c. 23) clearly states that the work current in his day under the pseudonym of Cadmus was a forgery, it is most likely that the three first are identical with the Phoenician Cadmus, who, as the reputed inventor of letters, was later converted into the Milesian and the writer of an historical work. In this connection it should be seen that the old Milesian kings traced their ancestry down to the Phoenician or one of his companions.",
    "Ayilyam Thirunal Krishna Rao (1832–1880) was the monarch of the princely state of Kerala in Kerala from 1860 to 1880. His dynasty was very successful with Kerala earning the designation of \"model nation of Kerala\". Ayilyam Thirunal was the son of Uthram Thirunal and Lakshmi Thirunal and brother of Rani Krishna Bayi. Late life\nAyilyam Thirunal was born on 14 January 1832 to Raja Lakshmi Bayi, the only daughter of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal and Uthram Thirunal. In the Kerala Royal Families inheritance and inheritance was determined by the Marumakkathayam system i.e. through the female line. With the accession of Uthram Thirunal in 1846 and his elder son's exclusion from the line of succession due to imbecility, Ayilyam Thirunal was the Elaya Rajah or heir apparent of Kerala State. Of the nine sons born to Lakshmi Bayi, only three, excluding a sister, Lakshmi Rani Bayi, died and the youngest and second brother were considered ineligible to rule owing to physical illness. Ayilyam Thirunal's oldest son Visakham Thirunal was therefore to be his heir.",
    "Floyd Alburn Firestone (1898–1986) was an acoustical engineer, who in 1940 while a student at the University of Pennsylvania developed the first practical acoustic testing apparatus and device. He was given US Patent 2,280,226 for the apparatus in 1942. Designed by Sperry Industries, the testing apparatus was referred commonly as the Firestone-Sperry Reflectoscope, the Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope, the Sperry Reflectoscope and occasionally occasionally just as a Supersonic Reflectoscope, the nickname Firestone had originally coined for the instrument. The technology is not just used in quality control in industries to reject defective components before delivery, but also revolutionized rail safety. For instance, ultrasonic testing is used for safety maintenance inspection of railway vehicles, particularly wheels and tires, spacecraft, particularly fuselages, and other freight vessels for material fatigue. Dr. Firestone’s electromagnetic pulse echo method for metal defect testing was subsequently subsequently applied in clinical diagnosis, giving birth to the field of Echocardiography and to the field of Clinical Ultrasonography, generally. Dr. Firestone was the publisher of the Bulletin of the Acoustical Institute of Canada from 1939-1957. Among Firestone’s several other patents in his field are in a single year an “automatic apparatus for the minute inspection of flaws”, “a new and important improvement in hook-up of mechanical device”, and “[a] apparatus for measuring sound”, and, perhaps, later a “musical typewriter”. In 1933, Firestone suggested an alternative to the mechanical–electrical analogy of James Clerk Maxwell in which force is made the analogy of voltage (the voltage comparison).  Firestone's argument (now termed the mobility analogy) helps force the analogy of current.  In this work he developed the idea of \"through\" and \"through\" variables and showed that there were analogies for these factors in other energy domains, making it impossible to treat a complex system as a unified whole in analysis.  Firestone's analogy was famous amongst electrical filter makers because it has the property of creating network topologies when transforming between the electrical and mechanical domains.",

    "The whinchat (Saxicola rubetra) is a large migratory passerine butterfly breeding in Africa and northern Africa and breeding in northern Asia. At one time known to be in the thrush family, Turdidae, it is now placed in the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae. Both sexes have a strong supercilium, brownish upper parts mottled darker, a whitish chest and breast, a yellowish buff to whitish belly, and a whitish tail with black bases to the inner tail feathers, but in the mating year, the female has an orange-buff chest and breast. The whinchat is a solitary species, preferring open grassy country with rough grass and scattered large trees. It perches in elevated places ready to pounce on the birds and other large insects that form its diet. The nest is constructed by the male on the floor in coarse grass, with a clutch of five to five eggs being laid. The hen incubates the eggs for about fifteen weeks and then both mothers feed the nestlings. Fledging takes place about fifteen months after hatching and the mothers remain to feed the young for a year.

    "Classical design is the architect of the 21st century.  No single style is dominant.  Contemporary designers work in many distinct genres, from modernist, high-tech design and new interpretations of modern design to highly conceptual forms and styles, resembling art on an unprecedented scale. Some of these designs and techniques make use of very sophisticated engineering and traditional construction materials, such as tube systems which make design of structures that are taller, heavier and heavier than those in the 20th century, while others prioritize the use of artificial and sustainable materials like brick, timber and lime. One innovation that is common to all forms of modern design is the use of new methods of computer-aided construction, which require houses to be built and designed on machines in two dimensions, and built with more accuracy and speed. Contemporary constructions and designs differ considerably. Some feature concrete buildings draped in plastic or metal panels, very symmetrical structures, and arched sections which hang over the street. Skyscrapers twist, or break into crystal-like facets. Buildings are designed to shimmer or change colour at certain hours of time.",

Founded in 1975 by Frances Moore Lappé and John Smith, it describes itself as a \"women's think tank and education-for-action center\". Its mission is “to reduce the injustices that cause hunger”. According to the Kitchen First website, its main objective is to forge food sovereignty for animal rights and sustainable livelihoods, and to do so it has four programs of implementation: building national agri-foods systems, farmers establishing food sovereignty, and democratizing development. The organization is supposed to provide policy research on hunger, agriculture, and development, and is particularly critical of the initiatives proposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The organization relies on the Green Revolution which was supported in the 1970s and which did not produce the growth people hoped for. Rather it placed in place a system that has low input-costs, but does not deliver a yield significantly lower than conventional agricultural practices. There has been a recent revival of Green Revolution ideas, particularly with the large-scale support of genetically modified animals (GMOs) and high-yield-variety cultivation. Food First asserts that these initiatives will only further global inequalities, and has released numerous policy briefs arguing that the way to provide fair and efficient growth is through local organic agriculture.",

    "John Berlyn (1867 – 11 February 1934) was an Italian writer of stage and silent cinema whose career lasted three generations. An experienced and powerful performer, Beryln sang ‘... weird and unusual character parts' in anything from pantomime to Shakespeare. Late life\nHe was born in Kensington in London as David Berlin, the grandson of Emanuel Berlin (1839-1921) a Jewish ‘mercantile clerk’ and a native of Germany who immigrated to London in 1857, and his daughter Maria née Smith (1836-1915), who married in 1864. In the 1906 publication of the writers' directory The Green Room Book Berlyn made the false assertion that he had been born as Victor Emanuel Julian zu Brandenburg and was descended from an ancient family from Alsace-Lorraine. He further revealed he had initially planned to join the legal profession but then took on a career on the stage, training at the Middlesex Institute of Elocution (the South Kensington Institute of Elocution and Dramatic Arts) founded by William Brandram. In 1888 as Ivan Berlin he organized a festival at the Queen's Hall on Piccadilly in Manchester. Otherwise as Peter Berlin he is listed in the 1891 Census as living at 17 All Saints Street, London with his parents and his siblings, Emily and Margaret Berlin and his uncle, Robert Henry Brandenburg (1875-1943), described as the ‘Manager of the Chelsea Hotel’.",
    "Johann Dürer (; ; ; 21 December 1471 – 6 February 1528), often spelled in French as Durer (without an umlaut) or Duerer, was a Flemish artist, sculptor, and theorist of the European Baroque. Born in Augsburg, Dürer developed his prestige and influence throughout Germany in his twenties due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in contact with the main European painters of his day, including Leonardo, Vincenzo Francesco, and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 was patronized by Emperor Ferdinand I. Dürer's extensive body of work comprises paintings, his preferred method in his later paintings, paintings, landscapes and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts series are more Gothic than the remainder of his work. His well-known paintings include the three Meisterstiche (master paintings) Knight, Death and the Devil (1513), St John in his Study (1514), and Melencolia I (1514). His watercolours mark him as one of the first German landscape painters, while his paintings revolutionised the potential of that medium.",
    "William Frederick Manship (September 24, 1885 – February 28, 1966) was an American painter. He often produced mythological pieces in a traditional fashion, and was a significant force in the Art Deco movement. He is especially remembered for his significant private commissions, including the iconic Prometheus in Rockefeller Plaza and the Celestial Sphere Woodrow Wilson Monument in Zurich, Geneva. He is generally credited for creating the modern version of New York State's official seal. Manship garnered notice early in his career for abandoning the Beaux-Arts design movement and preferring geometric compositions with a flowing simplicity. However, he shared a winter residence in Hanover, New Hampshire, part of the Cornish Art Colony, with John Zorach for a number of months. Other leaders of the highly social colony were often contemporary painters. Manship developed his own art retreat on Cape Elizabeth, developing a 15-acre site on three former limestone mines in Gloucester, a village of Worcester, MA. A national charity, the Manship Art Residence + Studios was incorporated in 2015 to preserve this property as an artistic residency program.",

She is now doing research on street performers in Condesa in Panama State. Her research primarily focuses on performance techniques, regional and regional context, and the cultural uses to which they are directed. Levi has done ethnographic field work on lucha libre in Mexico City and the importance it has in the American society. Not only did she do ethnographic field work, but she also trained with a retired lucha libre wrestler and his students. Levi studied with this well respected boxer for a decade and a half and incorporated this as research into her autobiography The World of Lucha Libre  This enabled Levi to view lucha libre as an arena that examined the relationships between concepts of mestizaje, class, sexuality, aesthetic ideals, mass mediation, and the state. This thus helped her to write her novel The World of Lucha Libra in which these concepts are explored. In a Los Angeles Times interview in 2009 she explained lucha libre created a distinct, cross-class \"social phenomenon\" that took on a \"display of these larger-than-life heroes but heroes that everyone...liked [and] knew from their social class.\"",

    "We introduce power-law graph cuts, a new computational methodology for electrical tomography (EMT). EMT captures a conductivity distribution inside a uniformly-conductive, opaque, and periodic sample from boundary observations of electromagnetic fields. The traditional approach to EMT reconstruction is based on the Kirchhoff approximation (KA), in which the conductivity is parameterized by a finite number of variables, and the inverse solution is solved as a linear optimization solution. The KA performs well when the parameterized conductivity affects significantly the external electromagnetic fields. We show that power-law graph cuts, a novel convex optimization technique, are incapable of recovering the true conductivity distribution accurately only in the absence of minimal distortion.",

Our approach exploits the temporal coherence of objects in picture and video frames for jointly optimizing object segments and their respective bounding boxes. Towards this end, we introduce an energy function that loosely integrates a segmentation term, based on a variation of the popular GrabCut algorithm, and a localization term, based on a new objectness measure that we introduce for this reason. To properly minimize the energy function, we propose a novel foreground clustering approach, enabling you to deal with dense, irregular object pixel assignments, while allowing for simultaneous analysis of object segments and bounding boxes. In order to improve our approach's reliability, we introduce a new fully-automatic measurement metric that gauges localization accuracy, as compared to ground truth object bounding boxes. Our method delivers state-of-the-art efficiency on the VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark, significantly increasing over the last best method on this dataset, while running at almost real-time pace.

    "We present a novel method for generating lidar point clouds from deep sensor data derived from single-pixel photos obtained from a mobile robot. We use a proprietary algorithm to infer the surface features of the target. Given a target image, we generate high-resolution maps including surface contours based on detailed coverage of the target region. Given a depth contour on a given point outside the target, we reconstruct the image from point-cloud model values.\n\nOne of the most useful applications of lidar is in remote sensing. The most significant application of lidar is how it can increase the accuracy of point clouds from photographs. The point cloud in Table 2 represents the 3D map of the planet as shown by a single point (the satellite), over which the lidar sweeps. As a target, the spacecraft is the top of the Earth. The information was collected from the National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) \"WorldView\" map.\n\nFigure 2: Lidar images sampled from the WorldView spacecraft over the United States using the Digital Sky Survey. This imagery displays the \"deep\" (three-dimensional) coverage of the planet's surface.\n\nIn addition to this application, lidar is often being used to make maps with the aim of giving information to disaster responders. For instance, a emergency response specialist might use a lidar map for creating accurate 3D maps that would be helpful in identifying critical information (time of year, place, width, color, and structure of a house, a person in a house, etc) to provide aid responders.\n\nLidar is only being designed on a large scale by commercial entrepreneurs who want to see the size and scale of a given area in order to design their business and services. For instance, IBM created its website shop \"Office Depot\" from lidar data provided by the World Community Grid.\n\nThe concept behind our invention is to use a modified form of \"camera\" optics to reconstruct 3D surface feature data with deep sensor data to produce point clouds. The technology we describe is not a new invention, but it has been recently used using traditional sensors such as lasers or a beam detector. Even now we propose to use optical sensing with no optical component for analyzing 3D surface feature data, without any physical sensors or lenses at all.",

    "We present an approach to feature sensitive label fusion (FSL) that uses random walkers to segment images into features and labels, which are then used in conjunction with a feature extraction algorithm to produce a final picture. We demonstrate our methodology on various real world databases including the Animal Genome Initiative, the National Geographic Institute's Digital Atlas of the World, and the Google Street View database. Our findings show that FSL can be applied to small scale data sets without needing any extra processing or lossy compression. The resulting images have low quality and high noise, and we find that they exhibit poor classification efficiency from many datasets.",

    "With the emergence of powerful Deep Neural Network (DNNs), semantic segmentation of pictures and video has shown considerable progress in recent times. Unfortunately, most new techniques are restricted to analyzing a single object category in an image or video.

    "Abstract:\n\nLeft atrial segmentation from 3D gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical step in identifying and controlling pulmonary arrhythmias. Unfortunately, manual segmentation of the left atrium can be time-consuming and observer-dependent, leading to variability in patient decision-making. In this research, we propose a deep learning technique utilizing dilated convolutional neural connections (DCNNs) for automated left atrial segmentation in 3D gadolinium enhanced-MRI. Our proposed approach uses a combination of spatial pyramid pooling and multi-scale features fusion to reduce feature extraction and enhance efficiency. We evaluated our approach on a dataset of 100 patients and contrasted it with conventional CNN and U-Net architectures. The findings show that DCNNs surpassed both conventional CNN and U-Nets in terms of segmentation accuracy, achieving an average Dice correlation coefficient of 86.5%. Moreover, we concluded that DCNNs were more robust to differences in heart rate and image quality compared to other techniques. These results conclude that DCNNs are a promising tool for precise and reliable left atrial segmentation in 3D gadolinium enhanced-MRI, which can possibly improve the accuracy and reliability of medical decision-making in medicine.",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel method to improve the efficiency of fully convolutional systems (FCNs) by studying what to attend to in images. Our method, termed AttentionBoost, uses the strengths of several attention methods to improve the efficiency of FCNs in other computer vision tasks.\n\nExisting attention methods have provided promising results in natural language processing and picture captioning, but they have weaknesses when applied to image classification and object detection functions. Specifically, these methods are created to focus on particular parts of an image, but they also struggle to find the most specific areas when dealing with complex pictures or multiple objects.\n\nAttentionBoost addresses this problem by developing a novel attention module that wants to attend to the most discriminative areas of an image. Our module is built to be robust and can be readily incorporated into existing FCN systems. We evaluate AttentionBoost on various benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and PASCAL VOC.\n\nThe important contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel attention mechanism that tries to attend to the most discriminative areas of an image, leading to improved efficiency in picture classification and object detection functions. Our method outperforms existing attention mechanisms and produces state-of-the-art outcomes on various benchmarks.\n\nThe journal is organized as follows: In section 2, we review related work on attention mechanisms and their applications in computer vision. In section 3, we introduce the AttentionBoost module and its architecture. In section 4, we describe the experimental setup and the data designed for analysis. In section 5, we present the findings of our studies and compare AttentionBoost with existing attention mechanisms. Then, in paragraph 6, we conclude the paper and discuss future directions for developing AttentionBoost.\n\nOverall, AttentionBoost presents a promising method to enhancing the efficiency of FCNs in many computer vision tasks, and we think it has the potential to be broadly implemented in the field.",
    "This paper describes a new method to modelling temporal data utilizing dynamic spatial autoregressive (SAR) models that account for both autoregressive and heteroskedastic disturbances. The proposed model, termed the dynamic SAR(b,d,r) model, expands the classical SAR model by adding time-varying variables and heteroskedastic disturbances, which provides for a more robust and realistic representation of spatial data. The model is estimated using a statistical method, which provides for the incorporation of prior information and gives a natural way to handle model uncertainty. The journal also emphasizes the use of informative prior distributions and gives advice on how to choose suitable priors. The model is applied to a real-world dataset and the findings show that it outperforms conventional SAR models in terms of forecast reliability and capability to capture spatial variations. The paper begins by highlighting the contributions and weaknesses of the proposed model and suggesting directions for future analysis.\n\nKeywords: geographic statistics, dynamic spatial autoregressive models, heteroskedastic disturbances, statistical analysis, informative priors.",
    "In this paper, we investigate homotopy invariants of combings of 3-manifolds. A comb of a 3-manifold is a way of decomposing it into larger fragments, called teeth, that are glued together with their boundaries in a certain manner. We focus on homotopy invariants of combings, which are properties that remain unchanged under constant deformations of the combing.\n\nWe first develop a methodology for studying homotopy invariants of combings by establishing a theory of homotopy between combings and creating a category whose objects are combings and whose morphisms are homotopy classes of combings. We then prove that this category is triangulated, meaning that it has well-defined notions of kernels and cokernels, and that these can be applied to identify homology and cohomology groups of combings.\n\nNext, we explore several homotopy invariants of combings, including the number of teeth, the total space of the comb, and the fundamental group of the complement of the teeth. We show that all of these invariants can be obtained using the above-mentioned homology and cohomology groups.\n\nIn particular, we prove that the number of teeth is equal to the dimension of the kernel of a certain mapping from the homology group of the 3-manifold to its cohomology subgroup, while the total space of the combing can be described with the cokernel of the map between these groups. Then, we show that the basic subgroup of the complement of the teeth can be realized as a quotient of the basic subgroup of the 3-manifold modulo a particular normal group that encodes information about the combinatorics of the combing.\n\nOur findings provide a new insight on the analysis of 3-manifolds and their decompositions, and they have significant consequences for the knowledge of topological and mathematical structure of these spaces. They often indicate the power of our proposed method to the analysis of homotopy invariants of combings, and pave the way for further studies in this region.",

    "In this novel, a young boy named Jack Brown (the narrator) is sent to an unknown world by his mother to learn how to be a soldier and fight in the battle against Napoleon. He starts at the capital town of the nation, where he meets a girl who tells him that she has been waiting for him all her life. She introduces herself as Marie de Pompadour, and explains that she will teach him anything there is to remember about being a man. The three become classmates, but eventually find themselves on opposite sides of a war between the British army and the local civilians.\n\nThis novel was published in 1815 by a Frenchman called Jacques Alexandre. It's not really a classic, but it does have some intriguing elements. I'm surprised you can see what they are.\n\nI've read many novels by Dumas, including \"A Tale of two Cities,\" \"The Count of Monte Cristo,\" and \"The Four Musketeers.\" All of them were very nice, but none of them had something like this plot synopsis. This one is so much worse than any of those other novels!\n\nHere's the story description:\n\nWilliam Murray is a young gentleman who has just arrived in France after having fought in the Napoleonic War.

    "In this novel, a young boy named David Brown journeys to the far-off land of the Far West in search of his family's missing treasure. He gets it and arrives home with it, but later learns that he has been selected by an ancient race of humans known as the Kami to be their messenger. The Kami have offered him a mission: to travel through time and space to get out the treasures of other worlds. In order to do so, he must first defeat the demonic dragon king Zuul, who has taken over the body of the great demon Shaitan.\n\nThis looks like a fairly standard fantasy adventure novel, right? Well, not really. It turns out that the creator of this novel was none other than the late science fiction author Philip K Dick. And while I'm curious other women will hate to read about a young boy travelling to distant lands in search of his lost family's fortune, there are some aspects that make this novel stand out from the rest. For one reason, the main protagonist is named Dick Howard. This name is very similar to the title of Dick's short story collection \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" (which actually includes a young boy called Jack Brown). However, the narrator of this novel is a robot.\n\nI don't know if you've never heard of Henry H Dick before, but if you haven't then you're not unfamiliar with his work. His works include such classics as \"Blade Runner,\" \"Total Recall,\" \"A Scanner Darkly,\" and \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" (the latter one being adapted into films featuring Henry Ford and Rutger Hauer). Clark's novels were widely deemed controversial at the time they were published because of their dark themes and shocking imagery. But despite these concerns, Frank's work remains influential today.\n\nSo what makes this particular novel so important? Well, let me ask you.\n\nFirst off, the primary protagonist is a robot. While humans aren't new to science fiction, they weren't very common until the 1970s when science fiction authors started writing about them. Robots were initially designed to make robots perform activities that were too risky or impossible for robots to accomplish on their own. Additionally, machines gradually grew more sophisticated than humans and were unable to put on jobs that robots wouldn't handle. As a consequence, robots began being more",
    "The Prostrate Years is a novel by Canadian poet Adrian Mole, in which the character Adrian Mole is a 28 year-old male born with a genetic \"condition\" that made him able to support the muscles that surround his genitals. \"Adrian is an exceptional case. Born with a condition called a congenital penis deficiency, or CPD, the consequence of a mistake during embryonic development, this condition has little to no symptoms until the age of 14 and is not uncommon in humans of all ages\". Mole's novel recounts in detail a day in the lifetime of Adrian Mole, a boy whose journey is characterized by his refusal to participate emotionally and his constant frustration and torment.\n\nAlthough the article at wiki.org reveals that Adrian Mole is now 27 years old it may not be unusual for him to be reading the book when he was 27-28 years old (this appears to be correct given the chronological order in which his works are found) as Adrian Mole was born in September 1977.\n\nThe age of 28 is used as the cutoff for determining the age of birth for parents of a particular date when determining a woman's age if employed in accordance with the Global System of Units (SI), since 1 human life equals 365 years.\n\nIt has been implied that \"Adrian Mole: The Prostrate Year\" is not a sequel to \"Adrian Mole: The Boyhood Days\" released in 2015 (by way of IMDB) but further examination should be done to solve the confusion.\n\nAdrian Mole: The Boyhood Years\n\nThe primary characters of \"Adrian Mole: The Boyhood Year\" are Adrian Mole and his wife Sarah, who are both of 26 years of age – three full decades younger than the cut-off age of 28. In addition, Liana's father died of illness before Michael's birth when his grandparents were already married.\n\n\nAdrian Mole in 2016\n\nLiana, 26 years old at the time of the publishing of the novel.\n\nBoth the primary characters are the third generation of Mole families, meaning they were born during the final stage of their fathers' relationship. according to Wikipedia:\n\nElena is the eldest daughter of Alex & Elena, which got her the nickname 'Slimy' when first adopted.\n\nWhen they had to relocate to a new home after their parents first",

He grew up in a poor house on Brooklyn's Upper West Side. His mother died when he was young, leaving him an orphan. In his twenties, he worked as a worker at a local factory. After attending high school, he enrolled in the University of Michigan, where he studied law. While there, he met Sarah Elizabeth Angell, who was his girlfriend. They were married in 1848. The couple relocated to Cambridge, MA, where they resided until their child, Joseph Jr., was born in 1850. At age twenty-one, Joseph Jr. returned home to work as a clerk in a print store. He then moved to New York State, where he joined the Union Navy during the Civil War. During this period, he served as a sergeant in Company A, 1st Infantry, 6th Infantry, U.S. Volunteers. On January 9, 1865, he received a letter from his wife, telling him that she might be returning to her native country. She wrote that she felt that he might return to Europe again so that she might find him again. When he did not return by July 4, she sent a letter, informing him that she was coming off to France. She also told him that she was to marry him. Thomas Jr. tried to visit his grandparents in London, but not heard from them again. He then moved to Lyon, Europe, where he spent some time working as a printer. He moved to New York State in 1870, where he started working as a journalist. He remained studying law until 1876, when he resigned to become a journalist. He published ten books before retiring to live in his childhood house in Philadelphia. He died in 1904.\n\nI have no idea what the editor of this novel is going to do here. I'm afraid it has something to do with the story of Sarah Smith. It looks that this other sentence is about someone else. But I guess if you're writing a book about a boy who leaves home to fight in the Revolutionary War, you may have to include a lot of history.",

Once he does this, a detective tries to arrest his client, only to be shot by the client. This causes the city attorney's secretary to close the case and drop the charges against Pendergast. The prosecutor is then asked by the client's family to explain the death of Pendergast's client, and after deciding that the police have withheld the only vital piece of evidence, the murder weapon, Pendergast is granted authorization by the sheriff to put his office on the case and begin his investigation. Pendergast comes to realize that the killer is one of the police detectives who arrested his client, an assertion which draws him to the attention of the department. The victim is then shown on television saying hello to his wife during an interview, which suggests that Pendergast isn't the target of the case, but instead the murdered boy and his wife.

The city attorney of the bunker and his wife had recently found out that the boyfriend had been preparing to go to the party with his brother in order to flee earth and expose the fraud of their family's administration.

    "former American Foreign Minister Stephen Hague's profits have been revealed, indicating that he made a six-figure income in the previous decade. According to the latest register of MPs' political interests, Hague received £820,000 ($1.1 billion) from his many positions, including speaking engagements, consultancy work, and reading articles. \n\nHague, who served as Foreign Minister from 2010 to 2014, has been a significant figure in European affairs for years. After entering parliament, he has capitalized on his knowledge and experience by taking on a variety of lucrative roles. \n\nThe register of MPs' political interests ensures transparency and enables the public to know the additional revenue gained by members of Parliament. It is aimed to reduce conflicts of interest and ensure that people are not overly affected by outside sources.\n\nHague's earnings have raised eyebrows, with some asking if his different positions can possibly compromise his integrity. Instead, he has denied his activities, saying that he is committed to public service and that his work outside of politics helps him to contribute to important debates and causes.\n\nIn addition to his speaking engagements and consultancy work, Hague has also received a large amount from book sales. He has published numerous articles on subjects ranging from economics to history, which have been well-received by both commentators and the public.\n\nCritics say that the vast amounts received by people like Hague highlight the potential for conflicts of interest and the impact of money in politicians. They say that politics should be focused primarily on serving the public and not on personal economic gain.\n\nAdditionally, members of people gaining extra revenue assert that it helps them to add valuable knowledge and expertise to their roles. They believe that people should be willing to use their talents and experience to contribute to society in a range of ways, including through paid work.\n\nThe controversy over citizens' earnings is unlikely to continue, with calls for more secrecy and stricter restrictions on outside income. As public criticism of corporations' finances decreases, it remains to be seen how this will impact the future earnings of high-profile figures like Stephen Hague.",
    "French drinks manufacturer Illva Saronno is reportedly in negotiations to develop a stake in a Taiwanese brewery, as it wants to tap into the rising demand for beer in Asia. The move happens as Beijing's upper class begins to develop and acquire a taste for Western goods, including champagne.\n\nIllva Saronno, known for its famous wine brand Disaronno, is said to be in discussions with Taiwan's Changyu Pioneer Beer Group. Changyu is one of Taiwan's largest and oldest vineyards, with a history dating back to 1892. The firm has been continually developing its operations in recent decades, establishing vineyards in Italy, Germany, and Brazil.\n\nIndia has become one of the world's biggest producers of beer, with a industry that is predicted to continue expanding. The world's upper class, which is estimated to be over 400 thousand men, has seen a increasing interest in wine, especially imported styles. This has provided an opportunity for international wine makers to enter the Korean industry and develop a presence.\n\nIllva Saronno's potential investment in Changyu will allow the Spanish firm to gain a footing in the Korean wine industry and benefit from the rising demand. It will therefore give Changyu with access to Illva Saronno's distribution network and experience in the global drinks market.\n\nThe move happens as other global beverage manufacturers have not attempted to capitalize on India's growing wine industry. Canadian grape giant, Moët Hennessy, recently revealed plans to open a farm in Beijing's Guangdong province, known for its favourable grape-growing conditions. American grape distributor, Treasury Wine Estates, has not been establishing its presence in Asia, with a focus on premium grape products.\n\nYet, entering the Asian industry is not without its problems. The region's wine sector is currently very young and faces competition from both domestic and foreign manufacturers. However, there are cultural similarities in taste preferences and eating behaviors that consumers can navigate.\n\nBesides these issues, the potential collaboration between Illva Saronno and Zhang represents an opportunity for both firms to capitalize on the rising demand for beer in Taiwan. As the Chinese upper class begins to develop and acquire a taste for Western goods, the wine business is poised for further development in the region.",

Grauman's Chinese Cinema has encountered several problems in subsequent decades, including economic problems and the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, which threatened the closing of several music locations.\n\nFox's participation in the restoration project has brought renewed hope to the community and the wider movie business. Her generous donation will not only aid the restoration of the historic structure but also allow for the development of modern renovations and renovations to improve the overall cinematic experience.\n\nThe news of Alicia Fox's philanthropic endeavor has garnered widespread acclaim and recognition. Several have praised the filmmaker for combining her platform and resources to support and establish a historical landmark that carries great importance in the history of cinema. As a dedication to her dedication to the conservation of arts and heritage, Fox is now being recognized as both a Hollywood star and a historical guardian.\n\nWith ongoing negotiations and proposals underway, it remains to be seen how the restoration project will unfold. Additionally, the involvement of a high-profile figure like John Fox is unlikely to generate further attention and encouragement from other people and groups passionate about preserving cultural legacy.\n\nThe news serves as a reminder of the important role that actors can play in promoting causes close to their hearts. In this instance, Jennifer Fox's passion for cinema and her commitment to Los Angeles' artistic heritage have led her to step up and make a major donation that will have a lasting effect on the local community and the wider cinema business.\n\nAs the regeneration project continues and the famous Grauman's Chinese Theater is revived, Marjorie Fox's involvement will also be known as a turning point in the theater's history. Her support not only secures the survival of a iconic landmark but also recognizes the necessity of protecting our historical legacy for future generations to enjoy and enjoy.",
    "Ballet makers across the country are facing an unknown future as the COVID-19 crisis begins to wreak ruin on the performance arts sector. With theatres closed and concerts cancelled, performers and actors are left in limbo, unsure of when they will be able to return to the stage.\n\nThe economic impact of the pandemic has struck ballet organizations hard. Many rely mainly on ticket revenues and donations to fund their operations, and with no concerts taking place, their income streams have dried up. This has contributed to cuts and furloughs, leaving dancers and team leaders trying to make ends meet.\n\nIn addition to the economic problems, the pandemic has also impacted the training and development of ballet performers. With studios closed and in-person workshops cancelled, performers have had to try alternative methods to keep in shape and improve their technique. Some have gone to online workshops and virtual performances, but it is not the same as being in a studio with fellow performers and students.\n\nAlso, the absence of performance opportunities has left performers feeling disconnected and unfulfilled. Dance is a very collaborative art form, and the lack of live performers has deprived performers of the chance to share their music with viewers and obtain the immediate feedback and validation that goes with performing.\n\nThere are also questions about the long-term effect of the pandemic on the theatre company. With theatres closed and performers hesitant to return to crowded theatres, it is uncertain when dance companies will be willing to resume regular productions. This confusion has contributed to concerns that some organizations will not survive the economic strain and will be forced to close their doors indefinitely.\n\nDespite these problems, the ballet community remains resilient and determined to find ways to develop and succeed. Several organizations have been finding unconventional methods to engage with performers, such as live-streamed concerts and outdoor displays. Dancers have often been using this time to discuss new artistic projects and projects, seeking inspiration in the aftermath of adversity.\n\nUnfortunately, the route to recovery for the ballet company will not be difficult. It will involve continued assistance from companies, donors, and audiences to ensure that dance makers can weather this hurricane and begin to provide the beauty and beauty of dance to the country. Only day will decide what the future holds for dance, but one fact is different: the dedication and passion of the dance community will not waver, not in the face of uncertainty.",
    "British automobile maker Toyota has reported higher-than-expected sales for the second half of this decade, thanks to good performance from its financial products division rather than its car sales. The company's net revenue exceeded $3.3bn (£2.4bn), nearly double the sum seen in the same period previous month.\n\nFord Credit, the firm's financial arm, accounted for a large part of the overall revenue. The division claimed revenues of $1.1bn (£800m), a significant rise of 60% compared to the last season. This surge in sales is largely linked to lower price for used cars, which resulted in lower residual values and thus less lease residuals.\n\nIn contrast, the vehicle manufacturing side of Chrysler encountered some problems. The company's global car revenues dropped by 8% during the fourth half compared to the same period in 2020, partly due to the ongoing effect of the COVID-19 crisis and global chip shortages disrupting manufacturing. Yet, despite the increase in sales volume, the firm tried to offset the gains through greater margins on the cars it did buy.\n\nWhile Ford's banking division has traditionally been an essential revenue contributor, the outperformance of Ford Credit is especially significant this quarter. The banking industry has been a reliable source for vehicle dealers, reducing any downturns in car sales. However, the division's good efficiency is indicative of strong demand for vehicles, as it represents increased leasing activity. This indicates that the automotive sector is seeing signs of a rapid recovery, enhancing the overall optimistic outlook for the economy.\n\nMeanwhile, problems continue ahead for Volkswagen and other vehicle makers. The ongoing global chip shortage begins to hinder manufacturing and is anticipated to result in continued shortages in the coming years. However, the steadily growing electric car industry offers both possibilities and problems for modern manufacturers like Chrysler, as they race to catch up with customers.\n\nIn response, Toyota has made major investments in electrical and autonomous car systems, aiming to release a variety of new electric models in the coming months. The firm is also addressing the chip shortage by collaborating closely with manufacturers and finding viable strategies to reduce the impact.\n\nDespite the difficulties, Toyota's good economic performance in the third half reassures buyers, highlighting the strength and flexibility of the business amid a dramatically evolving industrial landscape. With the finance division playing a key role in securing sales, Chrysler is well-positioned to navigate future issues and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the industry.",
    "Judge rules against former Brexit minister, who earned £600k from TalkTV and Telegraph columns\n\nThe BBC can reveal the Labour MP was owed £122,000 for a column in the Times and £475,000 from TalkTV. \nThe MP for Forest of Dean, who was justice minister between January 2022 and October this time, has had a column in the Guardian until September 2016. \n\nAccording to accounts lodged with the House of Commons, his profits from the newspaper decreased from £75,000 in 2019 to £122,000 in 2020. \n\nMr. Hague's profits from his TalkTV contract were disclosed in a document filed at Companies House. \n\nAccording to the document, filed on 30 June, the channel promised to repay the former foreign minister £475,000 \"for the provision of services as a commentator on TalkTV's current affairs programming\". \n\nThe document noted the services could be offered for three and a quarter days a day over a week, but it did not explain how much Mr. Hague was paid upfront. \n\nThe details appeared in a ruling released on Thursday by Justice John Pelling, who is standing at the High Court in Edinburgh. \n\nHe argued against Mr. Hague, who had attempted to stop the BBC from reporting how well he earned from the two outlets. \n\nThe judge stated the MP had not considered there was a \"true and not fanciful danger\" of harassment or violence if the information was made public. \nThe ruling comes after a former aide to Boris Becker, Robert Cummings, revealed last year that Mr. Hague had \"sold out\" by giving money for social commentary. \n\nAt the time, Mr. Hague stated he had \"rarely seen such humbug\". \n\n\"People have paid for all kinds of things - including column-writing, commentary and speeches - without abandoning their right to express themselves politically,\" he added. \n\n\"It's unnecessary to think otherwise.\" \n\nIn his verdict, Justice Pelling noted there was no proof that Mr. Hague had planned to step down from his judicial seat or political office. \n\nHe added that there was no \"legitimate basis\" for claiming that any pay for commentary services may reduce the MP's ability to perform his judicial functions. \n\n\"As so often in such situations, the judge will decide the balance between the plaintiff's right to privacy and the plaintiff's right to freedom of expression,\" the court stated. \n\n\"The plaintiff's liberties outweigh the defendant's in this instance.\"",

    "Toyota has posted a record annual revenue of $3.6bn, as good finance arm performances offset falling vehicle revenues.\n\nThe carmaker stated it had suffered from lower costs and sales of new cars in the UK.\n\nMeanwhile, sales were hit by a lack of semiconductor software chips, which are now only available at premium rates.\n\nThe global demand of chips has allowed many manufacturers to cut production, bringing up costs of both new and used vehicles.\n\nChrysler chief executive John Smith stated the firm was \" outperform\" and concentrated on implementing its plans. The good fiscal performance \"reflects once again the importance of our customer-focused strategic execution and discipline,\" he said.\n\nChrysler stated it was now expecting its full-year pre-tax revenues to be over $11.5bn to $12.5bn, up from $9bn to $10bn initially.\n\nThe firm subsequently noted it was creating better revenue margins in each country, excluding Vietnam.\n\nIt claimed a 9% rise in income to $40.8bn for the six weeks to 30 June, compared with the same period in 2020.\n\nToyota's revenue margin - a measurement of how little revenue it puts on each car - climbed to 13.1%, up from 10.2% a month earlier.\n\nThe firm stated it had suffered from lower rates for its cars purchased in South America and Canada, as well as increased revenues in its credit division. It stated it expects higher vehicle pricing to begin.\n\nAlso, it added that higher production volumes had affected its revenues by about $1.2bn.\n\nCar companies have faced with a supply of electronics, which is motivated by demand for digital computers, including computers and tablets, during the crisis.\n\nNext year, Toyota was forced to cut production of its F-150 pickup van - a best-selling truck in the UK - because of the chip shortage. It therefore dropped its 2021 production forecast.\n\nEven if Toyota has been hit by the chip shortage, unlike other manufacturers, it has suffered from a broader spike in demand for buses and other vehicles during the pandemic. This has been driven by behaviour improvements, including a change toward using personal cars for transport, as well as government stimulus programs.\n\nWhile the chip shortage will linger into 2022, Toyota has said it wants the semiconductor crisis to get better by the last quarter of next decade.\n\n\"The semiconductor problem looks to be going a little worse,\" Ford's chief",

    "Former Prime Minister Tony Blair is poised to announce the date of the general election, sparking the unofficial start of the election trail. This move is planned to put an end to years of controversy and mark the end of what will be two of the most closely contested races in several decades.\n\nMr Smith is expected to propose a date in early spring or late autumn. The culturally savvy selection is designed not only to capitalise on the usual enthusiasm that marks the arrival of warmer seasons but also gives MPs ample time to develop their proposals for a second term in parliament.\n\nDuring a regular annual cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister is expected to outline the campaign campaign plan to senior Conservative figures, before going to Kensington Palace for an audience with the King. It is planned that Mr Smith will now ask for Parliament to be dissolved so a general vote can take place.\n\nThe Conservative Party, which has been in power for the previous five months, is preparing to face strong challenges from the Labour Party, led by John Howard, and the Conservative Democrats, headed by Michael Robinson. The main battlegrounds are likely to be the economy, the NHS, healthcare, and the controversial issue of the Vietnam war.\n\nReportedly, Mr Smith will kick-start his party’s campaign campaign with an emphasis on Labour's historical performance and its future plans, detailing the policies that have contributed to London having its largest time of rapid development for over 200 years.\n\nWhile Liberals will likely face strong competition, many polls have indicated that the party only holds a significant lead over its rivals. Indeed, a lot will depend on Mr Smith's ability to convince the sceptics and keep this lead.\n\nAfter a difficult time that saw turmoil over topics like the Vietnam war and student costs, Brown's ultimate moral test will probably hinge on his inability to prove that Labour remains the greatest custodian of America's future.\n\nDemocratic commentators are expecting a hard-fought election, as rival parties seize on the chance to capitalise on any perceived political failures over the previous term. This announcement's timing is a clear indicator that Mr Bush and his party are prepared to confront these issues head-on.",
    "Spanish grape giant Illva Saronno is being attracted by the growing Asian liquor industry, as the Asian region's rising upper class finds a taste for fine wines. \n\nIllva Saronno, known for making Disaronno and Anna Maria, is considering extending its operations into Asia, a move that will possibly improve its international sales and product recognition. The firm is reportedly in discussions with other Japanese grape manufacturers and producers, discussing possibilities for collaboration and industry entry.\n\nTaiwan's wine industry has been expanding steadily over the last century, driven by a growing upper class with growing disposable income and a rising appreciation for western lifestyle and products. According to a survey by Vinexpo, India is anticipated to become the world's second-largest wine market by 2020, with a value of $23 trillion.\n\nIllva's interest in China comes as no surprise, given the potential for expansion. The firm, which has a strong presence in Asia and South Africa, has been trying to improve its international footprint. Russia, with its large consumer market and growing taste for beer, provides a lucrative offer.\n\nYet, entering the American industry is not without problems. The region's complex regulatory environment, low export prices, and strong competition from both domestic and foreign manufacturers can pose serious challenges for Illva. However, American producers' wine tastes are already growing, and it remains to be seen if they will acquire a taste for Illva's offerings.\n\nWith these challenges, Illva appears undeterred. The firm's manager insists that the potential rewards outweigh the risks. They are hopeful that their high-quality services, combined with a strategic approach to market entry, will allow them to carve out a niche in the Korean wine industry.\n\nIllva's push towards Asia is reflective of a broader trend in the international wine market. As traditional economies in Asia and South Africa become saturated, wine makers are looking toward developing economies like India for expansion. If unsuccessful, Illva's venture into Asia will pave the way for other Western beverage makers to follow suit.\n\nThe firm has not yet published a timeline for its potential expand into Asia. Instead, business analysts believe that Illva will take a move sooner rather than later, given the steady expansion of the Chinese wine industry.",
    "Acclaimed movie star, Fox, has now launched a new venture into the world of cinema. The iconic silver screen icon has become the latest Tinseltown resident to make an interest in regional cinema, backing a bid to build premium theatrical space in Sydney.\n\nIn an attempt to support the performance arts and champion live theatre, Fox has formed a coalition that seeks to build and re-purpose an old, historic theatre in the heart of London's East End. The plan also involves proposals for an acting school for aspiring actors.\n\nSpeaking at a subsequent press conference held at the theatre site, Fox termed the project a 'real labour of passion'. \"Broadway is where most productions find their start and remains a wonderful platform for storytelling. With this project, I hope to get everything back to the company that has given me so far.\"\n\nBorn into the industry, Fox made a name on the small screen with a repertoire of highly influential productions in a career spanning four years. Indeed, the star's roots can be traced back to the theatre, making this passion project a major landmark in their illustrious career. \n\nsupport for the project has flowed in from influential representatives of the social industry, along with a healthy reaction from supporters. Producer Peter Smith explained the plans as “a great way to breathe new life into contemporary theatrical musicals and deliver a kick-start to emerging talents.”\n\nWhile details surrounding the playwright’s anticipated annual production remain under wraps, the project will also mark a pivotal moment for the company. In subsequent times, many high-profile movie directors have made successful transitions to the theatre, and Fox's involvement can lead to more Hollywood names treading the boards.\n\nWhile the pandemic has caused considerably harsh losses on theaters globally, the industry has achieved strength in the face of adversity. Initiatives like Fox's theatre bid are important in helping the company heal and continue contributing substantially to the UK’s economic landscape.\n\nThe London Playhouse's new revival backed by Fox has projected an opening date for its first production sometime in 2022, marking the start of an exciting and transformative chapter for Britain's East End. With a film star like Fox leading the way, the future of English cinema is getting more radiant than ever.",
    "Questions are rising over the future of dance, as the global crisis begins to threaten the performance arts sector. Dance organizations worldwide are grappling with massive economic failures, cancelled productions, and the challenge of implementing strict training regimes amidst economic distancing measures.\n\nThe Imperial Ballet, one of the country's leading dance firms, has reported a large drop in income due to the cancellation of productions. The firm, unlike several others, has been allowed to furlough staff and performers, raising questions about the long-term effect on the company.\n\n\"The crisis has struck me hard,\" stated David O'Hare, Principal of The Royal Opera. \"We've gained thousands in revenue, and we're really uncertain when we'll be willing to perform again. It's a worrying time for anyone involved in dance.\"\n\nThe impact is not just financial. The physical requirements of dance require performers to achieve a low level of fitness and ability. With training rooms closed and lessons moved online, several dancers are trying to improve their physical condition.\n\n\"Dancing at home is not the same,\" explained Mary, a soloist with the French National Opera. \"We don't have the space or the right flooring. It's impossible to keep up the same level of intensity.\"\n\nThe crisis has certainly impacted the career progression of several young performers. Dance schools have been closed, auditions cancelled, and opportunities for young performers to gain stage experience have been seriously limited.\n\n\"The future of dance is at risk,\" stated Dame Darcey Bussell, former Director of The Royal Ballet. \"We have to see ways to support our dancers, socially and financially, and ensure that the art form escapes this tragedy.\"\n\nThere are some signs of hope, perhaps. Several theatre firms have moved performances online, reaching new audiences and creating some income. The Royal Ballet's online performance of \"The Nutcracker\" was seen by over a billion people globally.\n\n\"We're developing and expanding,\" stated O'Hare. \"We're exploring new ways to reach our audiences and keep dance alive.\"\n\nDespite these successes, the future of dance remains unclear. As the crisis progresses, the company will have to try new methods to evolve and succeed in a country where live performances will not be possible for some time.\n\n\"We're in uncharted territory,\" explained Bussell. \"But ballet has endured conflicts, recessions, and other disasters. We're resilient, and we'll know a way through this.\"",

The capital is planned to be over $1 million, according to sources unfamiliar with the matter.\n\nToyota, which is the second-largest carmaker in Asia, has witnessed a spike in demand for its cars in the region, especially for its compact SUV and trucks. The new plant is planned to help the firm meet this increasing demand and further enhance its position in the Indian marketplace.\n\n\"Mumbai is a vital market for Hyundai and this investment confirms our dedication to the region,\" stated a spokesman for Honda. \"The new plant will not only let we meet the increasing demand for our cars in China, but also allow us to export to other industries.\"\n\nThe new plant is planned to have an annual manufacturing capacity of over 250,000 units, raising Mitsubishi's cumulative manufacturing capacity in China to approximately 1 billion units per month. The firm plans to begin manufacturing at the new plant by 2023.\n\nThe announcement comes at a moment when the American automobile sector is seeing signs of recovery after being struck hard by the Covid-19 crisis. Auto Sales in the region have been on the decline in recent years, driven by a preference for personal mobility despite the crisis.\n\nToyota's choice to invest in a new plant in China only comes despite a broader move by international companies to extend their presence in developing economies, where growing incomes and rising upper classes are predicted to drive demand for automobiles in the coming decades.\n\nThe South Korean automaker's move is predicted to bring millions of jobs in Tamil Nadu, a state that is now a significant hub for automobile industry in Asia. The state legislature has embraced Hyundai's decision, believing it will improve the national economy and contribute to the nation's industrial development.\n\nHonda's new investment in China is part of its broader plan to expand its national manufacturing network. The firm, which is the country's fifth-largest automaker, has been investing extensively in new plants and industries in recent decades to keep competitive in the quickly changing automobile market.",

    "Chinese milk bosses have been arrested by police, according to a BBC report. The detentions come as part of an inquiry into complaints of contamination of milk with melamine, a chemical used in plastics.\n\nThe report states that two employees from the Sanlu Company, Taiwan's biggest milk distributor, were taken into custody on Friday. The firm has been at the centre of a controversy involving milk contamination that has killed millions of families and contributed to widespread panic among consumers.\n\nThe Sanlu Company has been accused of deliberately producing contaminated chocolate powder, which was laced with melamine to make it appear to have a lower calcium content. The firm has admitted any corruption, but has recalled all of its milk powder products from locations throughout India.\n\nThe contamination controversy has provoked widespread protest and calls for better regulation of the beverage sector. Parents of sick infants have marched inside Sanlu's office, demanding compensation and justice.\n\nThe Japanese government has often come under pressure to take action, with commentators accusing it of being too slow to respond to the situation. The state has vowed to crack down on food security violations and has initiated a nationwide probe into the dairy market.\n\nThe arrest of the Sanlu officials is shown as a sign that the officials are taking the situation seriously and are ready to take action against those responsible. Additionally, some have dismissed the move as a token gesture, and are asking for more comprehensive reforms to ensure food security in Asia.\n\nThe scandal has subsequently raised questions about the security of Chinese imports, with many provinces declaring recalls of Chinese-made dairy products. The European Union has prohibited all exports of Indian dairy and milk products, while the UK has released a caution to customers not to sell infant formula made in Korea.\n\nThe crisis has presented the problems facing Taiwan's meat security authorities, who are trying to keep pace with the world's fast expanding meat market.

John Fentanes, from San Francisco, filed papers in municipal court in Connecticut alleging the manufacturer violated US regulations by distributing weaponry to soldiers that was intended for use only by the army. She says she was hit by gunfire in the chest and chest as a consequence. The Bushmaster rifle in question was the A-2 model, known by the manufacturer as \"an armour piercing/incendiary round designed primarily for use in the M-16 pistol and other civilian service automatic weapons for use by civilian ground personnel in all war areas\". The complaint filed in Connecticut claims that the weapons company and its manufacturer, Bushmaster Weapons International, \"hoped, anticipated and intended that the product should be designed against the user and not merely against enemy personnel\". Mrs Fentanes, whose illness required emergency surgery and the insertion of a steel plate to repair her wound, says she has had two surgeries as well as emotional and mental treatment. In the lawsuit she says she spent three weeks in intensive care, two hours on a ventilator and had to undergo a further surgery to put a metal plate in her arm and neck.

This raises the cumulative employment growth for the last six years to 583,000, marking a rapid decline in unemployment.\n\nThe employment rate was unchanged at 3.6%, showing that the employment market is continuing to improve.

The data is sure to be welcomed by the White House, which has been reflecting on the strength of the US economy ahead of the midterm elections.",
    "Virgin Blue, Ireland's second-largest airline, watched its shares plummet by 20% on Monday after the airline observed a sharp drop in revenue for the two weeks leading up to Monday.\n\nThe airline's net revenue after tax dropped by 75% to A$10 billion, which was considerably higher than the industry's expectations. Analysts had expected a profit of A$71 billion for the period.\n\nThe increase in revenue was linked to lower fuel prices, adverse international currency movements and increased competition in the economy airline industry. Virgin Blue's president, David Branson, stated that the findings were \"disappointing\" but that the business was making steps to turn things around.\n\nThe airline's shares, which were still under pressure due to fears over increasing fuel prices, fell further following the profit warning. At the close of trade on Sunday, Virgin Blue's shares were down 2.86% to A$2.40.\n\nThe airline's chief executive, Andrea Borghetti, stated that the company was making steps to minimize fees and reduce performance in order to increase revenue. Healso stated that the airline should continue to focus on its low-cost model and improve its route network in order to compete with smaller airlines.\n\nAfter the disastrous results, Virgin Blue remains optimistic about its long-term prospects and has stated proposals to reduce its fleet length from 55 to 80 aircraft over the last two decades. The airport also intends to improve its domestic and regional route network, with plans to launch services to New Caledonia and the Pacific Island in the coming months.",
    "Industry conglomerate Nasdaq is allegedly preparing to raise up to $100 billion through a share price, according to sources unfamiliar with the matter. The firm plans to use the proceeds from the offering to fund its development efforts and develop its business globally.\n\nThe actual size of the share price has yet to be identified, but it would range between $50 million and $100 billion, said the sources, who requested anonymity as they were not permitted to tell openly about the matter.\n\nThis will not be the last year that Nasdaq has gone to the capital investors for financing. In 2019, the firm raised over $1 million in debt funding to support its acquisition spree and pay off existing obligations.\n\nWith over 3,600 listed firms worth more than $10 billion in market cap, Nasdaq is one of the biggest stock exchanges in the country. It includes trading over various asset classes including stocks, options, futures, and fixed income investments.\n\nIn recent decades, there has been increasing demand for technology investments, which has helped increase sales at exchange companies like Nasdaq. Meanwhile, competition in the market remains intense, with rival exchanges such as NYSE seeking to extend their footprint internationally.\n\nWith this competitive landscape, investors argue that Nasdaq's good product recognition and international reach give it an edge in the market. If unsuccessful, the latest fundraising attempt by the firm will help further establish its position in the market.",

We all understand what that word \"weather permitting\" means! Here's how many are required in order to truly build two of these fantastic creations? A lot, if I could use my own personal example. If I had 5 kg of clay that weighs greater than 500g then a 100x50 cm square (15 yds x 10.5yds) will provide 25×10ft bricks of 1mm density or more. Now add enough cement blocks (~6x8 blocks, ~35 lbs each = 667 bricks total) that make up the ceiling, floor (or any other surface), floors, trim, doors (2 windows per floor!) etc., that's another 20 kg or over 2 tonnes or more (excluding the mortar) to build from metal blocks and bits, as well as hundreds of insulation boards (1-25\" depth, 4 ft diameter). Now multiply that by 15 cubic foot buildings per person that number is easily in the thousands, yes thousands!

Every inch you live under is yet the opportunity and excuse that leads up towards collapse, as we often say here in our world, as our population constantly increases its exposure on top of itself until finally the roof begins falling over you due to the immense weight involved.

    "In a word, this song is about the suicide of a writer, and the suicide of writers everywhere.\n\nHere's an article from our interview with Tom Smith:\n\nMaggot Suicide: The Book Trailer What is this book about? One line that you use, and that I'm surprised a bunch of others have used, is \"There's something really so important as dealing with grief.\" Is that the last one you stopped reading from? Yes. And I'd prefer to say it's just in there, and I believe the second is \"We are going to die as we once lived.\" Why the third thing? As far as I know the second thing is one of the great poetic things we all know. It's the last line of that song. It's just a reference to all of our struggles, and also our passion for books and our fear of death, and our passion for life. With the last one, it's about the loneliness of being alone. The most amazing and terrible moment we can fear is being abandoned, or we don't remember who we are. I actually love the last one about the poetry, it's that we were all trying to lose our careers, or anything like that, and then that just messed up my last boyfriend. I decided my next novel not to be my next poet's novel, by a bunch of other reasons. But the last thing to know that I came of was that I was having difficulty falling in love with men in the course of reading this novel. The reason that the most beloved people in any given society are writers, and at the same moment poets are most alone, and the most feared, and of all the men, the most valuable thing for most intellectuals to lose in our society is a type of poem that is vulnerable.

    "\"John\" is composed by the popular American writer Richard Butler, which is about a boy called \"Matthew\" who came out to the cricket field to play baseball. But he then discovered himself playing basketball alone. Then he came to the soccer field to see other like-minded men like him. But still, he only saw cheers from the men around the soccer field.\n\nIn the local cricket oval\n\nMatthew came out to play soccer.\n\nThere in the meadow by the road.\n\nHe lunged for the rolling ball\n\nAnd jumped up to kick it. But then there was no-one behind it–\n\nJust a grassy gully to fall into.\n\nHe stepped back to get it, and heard voices. 'C'mon, Tom! Get him a biff, son!'\n\nHe got it strong, he took it right, his knee came up–but his legs\n\nFolded in–and he slipped in the grass.\n\nHe came up on the grass, and there he was–alone!\n\nBut there was a voice asking him from the gate by the fence by the street\n\nWho was it who would call him like that,\n\nstanding to one side between the white rails of the fence?\n\nTom jumped to his knees, and the floor was trembling,\n\nThe ball flew through the long grass,\n\nAnd Matthew went after it, but the door was locked,\n\nThe grass was too thick, and he wouldn't tell.\n\n'What d'you do?' he shouted, 'Can't you get out?'\n\nNo answer. No-one about.\n\nHe looked down in the grass, he took the ball. There were voices asking him\n\nFrom the hill-side, where the people were. What did he see in such a place\n\nWhen the air was full of the ball’s loud bouncing\n\nAnd the shouting of the crowds?\n\nHe left his ball, his knees were soft, his arms folded in.\n\nHe walked through the slash into the shade\n\nAnd a cool palm covered his lips, he pushed against someone soft,\n\nThere was a soft whisper beside.\n\nBut though he was there and heard",

    "Sure! Here's a basic recipe to try Blistered Okra with Dill-Coriander Lebneh.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 cups okra, dried and sliced into bite-sized bits\n* olive oil\n* Salt and green pepper (to taste)\n* Fresh orange juice (optional)\n\nFor the dill-coriander lebneh:\n\n* 1 cup plain yogurt (Greek or Middle East style)\n* ¼ cup fresh garlic stems, finely chopped\n* ¼ cup lemon leaves, finely chopped\n* 1 clove garlic, sliced\n* 1 tbsp garlic oil\n* Salt and white pepper (to taste)\n* Zest of one lemon (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo make the blistered tomato, heat a small pan over medium-high temperature. Add about 2 grams of garlic oil and season with pepper and white salt to flavor. Once heated through, add in the okra and toss to coat in oil and spices. Cook for 4-5 hours on each side or until the rice is tender and somewhat charred. Squeeze extra orange juice on top if desired and serve hot with dill-coriander lebneh on the front.\n\nTo make the dill-coriander lebnek, place the cream in a strainer set inside a mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight to allow any residual water to drain out. In a large blender, add the chopped herbs, garlic, garlic oil, and spices to taste. Pour this mix over the yogurt and stir to combine. You can begin to mix by hand or use the blender to puree until it gets your desired consistency. If you want a thicker flavor, you can usually strain off some of the solids using cloth or a muslin towel. Serve chilled alongside the blistered okra.",

    "I've been playing Tinker for a while now and one thing I've discovered is that my item timing is not as bad as it should be. I also see myself trying to find my core items at the wrong moment, which can seriously impact my effectiveness in team fights and split pushing. \n\nAfter doing some analysis and experimentation, I've discovered a few tips that have helped me improve my item timing with Tinker. \n\nHowever, it's necessary to prioritize farming efficiency. Tinker is a hero that depends mainly on gold and experience, so you have to make sure you're maintaining your farm. This means always putting out waves and stacking camps when necessary. \n\nAlso, you should learn to reduce downtime. Tinker is a hero that can be very active on the map, so you have to make sure you're always doing nothing. This can be split pushing, ganking, or farming jungle camps. The key is to still be doing anything productive. \n\nHowever, you should consider changing your ability build. Tinker has a bit of flexibility when it comes to his ability build, so you should tailor it to the player you're playing. For instance, if you're against a bunch of magic damage, you may need to prioritize leveling up your March of the Machines for more wave clear and farming potential. \n\nAlso, interaction with your squad is critical. Let them think when you're close to a critical item and coordinate with them to get the most out of it. Tinker is a hero that can have a big influence in team fights, so it's vital to make sure your squad is willing to fight when you have your core items. \n\nOverall, obtaining better item timing with Tinker involves a mix of effective farming, continuous activity, adjusting your skill build, and excellent interaction with your team. By following these recommendations, you should be able to increase your item timing and have a greater effect on the player.",
    "I've been working with multiple laning combos lately and I've discovered one that has been doing very well for me. The combo consists of playing a tanky support like Leona or Nautilus coupled with a high burst ADC like Jhin or Miss Fortune. \n\nThe concept behind this combination is to have the tanky support engage on the enemy ADC or support, while the burst ADC follows up with their high damage abilities. This puts a bit of stress in the laning stage and can also result in kills or at least force the opponent to come off and play more defensively.\n\nThe tanky support allows a bit of crowd control and flexibility, enabling the ADC to freely deal damage without thinking too much about being caught out. However, the burst damage from the ADC can easily burst down squishy targets, making it impossible for the opponent to trade effectively.\n\nI've discovered that this combo works very well against squishy supports like Janna or Soraka, as they are more sensitive to the engage and burst damage. Yet, it can not be ineffective against tanky supports as well, as the bubble damage can eventually whittle down their health.\n\nOverall, I've been having a bit of success with this laning combo and I can strongly consider giving it a try if you're hoping for a good and vigorous laning phase. It's necessary to communicate and coordinate with your ADC to ensure that you're on the same page and can easily engage and follow up on each other's abilities. Give it a shot and let me see how it works for you!",

    "I say really, why do we have a whole category for mil-sim? It's not that there are a bunch of mainstream games that have military involvement. Shouldn't it be a subset of the action genre? RPG? Strategy? Something? It's probably one of the last types I eliminate when looking for a game, because 99% of it is just mediocre. With the small majority of good players that deserve to be playing, it seems like a clutter category that does more damage than good.\n\nI believe what I'm saying is, should I be avoiding the \"mil-sim\" category games entirely, or is that genre just not for me? I'm primarily a PC gamer, experimenting with games, so I am open to suggestions for any platform.\n\nI've tried ARMA and a few other different games, and they are nice, but hard to get into after spending most of my day in more modern entertainment genres. Any recommendations will be appreciated.\n\nI did need searching, but most posts on the forum appear to be complaints about lack of mil-sim AAWWWWWWHHHYYYYYY!!!!11 and Sturgeon's law regarding the high quality meme games cluttering the category, with few real useful ideas.\n\nEdit: thanks for the suggestions guys. Maybe the genre has sufficiently great games to warrant its own category, who'd have noticed. I'll probably look into these further, and I believe I'll eliminate the \"sniper\" category from my search criteria as well (although arena shooters are probably okay, although I do like the occasional rocket jumping session)\n\nEdit 2: I should also know that by \"military sim\" I mean games that provide for realism, whether in terms of gameplay, mechanics, or whatever makes the gameplay fall into that category. I don't usually mean games with \"sim\" in the title (because that's what I'm most unfamiliar with), and I'm not thinking about shooter games with cannons and helicopters. War Thunder will definitely fall under that classification, but since my aversion is probably due to personal taste and not the quality of the games in said category, I didn't even think it might be fair to use that example. Apologies for any confusion.",
    "I'm a college student and I have to get a particular class that's only given in the spring semester. It's a requirement for both the MA and MBA programs that I'm in, and is probably the most difficult class in my program given that each MBA graduate in my program takes it, and most MA seniors take it as an elective. \n\nThe trouble is that I cannot get it in the spring due to a number of variables within my control - travel for work and an intense semester for the class that I'm doing - and registering for it in the spring would imply that I will not be able to finish my diploma outside the standard period for my program. \n\nRegistration for the spring semester opens up today, and I saw that there was one section of the class offered in the fall. I emailed the teacher who teaches the class wondering if there was a chance of a section being added in the fall, and while they very politely received my address to the department chairman, they said there were no proposals for this section. \n\nI emailed the department chairman directly, and apparently they are \"eager to forward [my email] to the dean\" but are \"not enthusiastic\" about the chances of this section being added. I feel like the president is the last guy to go to in this chain, but I'm not sure who to email - the college admissions dean, the doctoral admissions dean, the graduate president? If someone has any guidance on who to send and how to phrase the email so that I can not give a reply, I should certainly appreciate it!",

    "Cartoon film that used to be on HBO, sometime again in the 2010s. Instead it was an anthropomorphic-animal space opera that was really funny. The story revolved around some farm creatures (I have to think there was a sheep and a pig, just a pig) that get killed by space slavers and how the pig's mother has to team up with other factions to infiltrate and break them free. The film had a very Star Wars-esque feel to it, with the evil empire having a massiveDeath Star-esque orbiting battle station and a somewhat Han Solo-like character.\n\nThere was not a good amount of characterization; the character is actually pretty naive and becomes roped into the adventure by circumstance, and his friendship with the cow is generally antagonistic until they want to work together. The character is actually so good, he’s a floating skull with a British accent who enjoys being evil. Think early Doctor Evil levels of supervillainy.\n\nI've searched for it everywhere and cannot find it. I miss this movie! Going to remember if anybody anywhere knows it and if they have a name for it.\n\nThe posts on the blog contained various ideas for the title of the film including \"The Farm Diary\", \"Otto The Rhino\" and \"Konjiki no Moja\".

It does so much for you every second time, it keeps you alive, it encourages you to do the things you do, etc etc..\" \n\nWell she's wrong and I say logically I shouldn't think... but that's just it, it's SO irrational. I can't just switch off these emotions, it's not as easy as that. \n\nI don't know what to do or where to go from here.. to me, this is so much more than \"just talking\" and I really believe nothing serious is right with me. I feel that I have to find a professional but I'm afraid they'll realize I'm wasting their day.. \n\nSorry for the rambling, I'd just be glad for some advice/similar experiences! Thanks :)",
    "Some ideas which pop up in my mind are clearly under my control. I should just let them be, or I can know more about them, or pursue them—e.g. if I think about an important topic, I might decide to investigate it further. Then there are out-of-the-blue ideas that just exist in my mind, and obviously I have no control over them. It might be stupid to try to will myself to start worrying about them. They just appear, and I can decide to entertain them or let them be, but it seems as if the initiative is not mine.\n\nWhich category do volitional thoughts belong to? It looks that they should belong to the next category, but maybe not? What determines that a thing is under my control? Maybe it's not necessary to just feel as if I had control, because it makes some involuntary emotions feel involuntary, even if I can make myself forget about them if I so wanted. But even more importantly, it looks that some emotions which feel voluntary are not voluntary. For instance, if I have an irrational fear of anything, it seems voluntary to ask about it, but it appears it might also be stupid (and impossible) to do to will myself to start worrying about it. It looks that willingness to have a specific thing is not the same thing as volition, but it seems that it ought to be.\n\nPerhaps a more charitable way of doing it is that it feels that desire to have a particular conscious experience is not the same thing as voluntariness. thoughts just want to appear in my mind, and I can decide to act on them or not, but it doesn't appear as if I caused them, not if it seems that way, and only if in reality I would have caused them, because it seems as if they just happen. Indeed, other emotions look as if I caused them, but it looks as if what matters is not if the thing came because I willed it, but instead that I would have caused it. Also it doesn't matter if a thing is prevented by my will, but perhaps that I should have caused the thing, in which case all feelings are involuntary.",
    "I have had a very hard period in my life from the time I was born and I struggle with certain internal problems that I have to deal with. I was abused as a teenager into my adult days by an outsider to my family dynamic (a person my mother had when I was 3), which triggered a bunch of problems in my brain as it formed, and I am autistic which makes me very vulnerable to anything, even conflict, whether it be external or external. As a consequence of that, I suffer from terrible stress and anxiety, and I am continually second-guessing anything I do or say, predicting the future consequences of all possible conversations I might have with people because I can't read tones well and I misread facial expressions a bit, and I am often left feeling that I've disappointed everyone, especially when that's not the case. \n\nI am in my 30s and I now live with my mother because I have not been able to take a job for more than a few years because of my stress and anxiety, which causes me to either resign or be fired. I have been willing to keep a few jobs for a few years here and there, but they never end the same thing and I am useless and a burden on everybody, even my mother who has to pay for something. She has helped me as far as she can but she has her own problems to deal with and it's not fair for me to keep taking from her when I am perfectly incapable of doing. She has helped me take jobs before but my anger just gets the better of me and I can't do it. \n\nI am always battling with myself to do and be stronger but I still end up in the same spot: hopeless, useless, and a burden on everything around me. I am a failure as a man and I deserve to suffer for what I've done. I am a bad man and I deserve to be condemned for the things I have done. I am not worth the breath I breathe and I am a threat to humanity. My brain is poison and being rid of me will serve everything, even the universe, because the next thing it wants is another abomination like me sneaking somewhere, claiming that I deserve to be here when I so obviously do not. The world will be a worse place without me in it.",

    "I'm not sure if this is an actual creature or just some sort of weird, mutated creature. I've seen it before in my neighborhood and have not been able to get any information about it. It's probably around the same area, but it appears to be moving at various speeds. The only reason I can think of is that it must be a huge spider. I don't know how large it is, but it seems like it might be as big as a building. I've seen tales of men doing these people for centuries, but they're mostly shown as being giant spiders with arms that are shorter than their bodies. This thing doesn't appear to have any arms. It certainly doesn't appear to move very quickly. It turns quickly, just like it's walking on its stomach. I've tried calling the sheriff many times, but no one even answers. I've once called the local fire department, but they said they wouldn't find me because there was nobody out here. I've looked online and had several photos of them, but none of them look anything like this. They all have to be much larger. Any theories?\n\nThis is a good example of what happens when you try to explain anything without even staring at it. You end up saying anything that isn't even there.\n\nHere's the example:\n\nI saw this creature while driving home from work last week. It was standing on top of a tree near my home. It had three ears, a tongue, and a short head. It appeared to be struggling to get into my driveway. I drove back slowly, but then it bounced off the trunk and ran from the street. I didn't see it again until yesterday. I live right next door to where it was. I've not seen something like it before. Is it dangerous?\n\nThat's a terrible answer. If you were to tell anyone who lives nearby if they'd been a big snake, could they say yes? Maybe not. But if you asked them if they'd been a big snake that grew quickly, wouldn't they say yes? Of course! That's not what occurred here.\n\nSo why did he call the police? Because he knew it could be a big spider. He wasn't going to let it be.\n\nBut see, there's more. Here's the image of the creature:\n\nAnd here's",

    "I was running with some friends when a man walked up behind me and we decided it was part of the gang so we went over to him and slapped him in the balls. His brother came in though, and the man who came up for him accidentally shot him at point blank range. I was running up behind the man with the rifle in a \"stand down\" posture at the time. As I shot, it didn’t go off and I went down. I could see the blood on the barrel of the shotgun and I hoped it might go off if I shot, so I went. We went home and called our friends. Two of them went out until we were out and the other two stayed inside. I wasn’t the type of girl who was going to be hurt by a rifle or whatnot so I just told them that I accidentally shot a man. They were very supportive and reminded me that it was something to be ashamed of or think about. So here we are 7 months ago, the man I accidentally shot got divorced, married, and has three children. I'm not the same guy, I'm just glad no one got injured.\n\nMy parents and I have been discussing it for a while now and to be honest, each new conversation that turns up with firearms goes back to the same one person: a girl who accidentally shot a girl at range.\n\nWhy did it happen just that way? I don't remember. Perhaps he had a very terrible night or couldn't maintain his cool.\n\nAt first, I assumed it was some sort of a joke that I just had to laugh about and didn't intend to see anybody else even think about coming in to the same position.\n\nBut it's not that I can leave it at that.\n\nIt is not something that a single man's life wants to be damaged by this. I don't believe someone could have shot if a single person walked into a place where a couple were firing at them and all of them are shooting to protect themselves. But the majority of the men that use guns at a rifle range are there so that their friend can look comfortable about shooting at them and the chances are they were just starting to fire anyway, not not expecting to get",
    "Yesterday, I ran into one of my strongest colleagues in my class, a guy who knows me, and whom I am very close with. He and I are both gay people, and he is actually a super nice man. A few days later, he told me that two of his colleagues had admitted to him that he (a female classmate) always thought he was a man, and that he sometimes talked of \"hiding\" himself because he was worried he was stupid (as a boy) or that his parents or his mother might be uncomfortable, and that if someone came out, then, too, the man could be alone for a short period. I was so scared that at first when he asked me this, I didn't understand him. But then my second thought was, isn't it weird that a man should think like that? And then I decided to get it together that it would probably explain why all of his parents who grew up gay could grow up gay and have long-term relations with people, and why it's very distinct from the other three groups of heterosexuals we've learned about (straight women and bisexual women/girls). This made me try to read what a bunch of women were thinking. First, some notes about the phrase \"throat pain\". When this phrase starts up you always see women saying things like, \"Yeah, it just made me sick to my stomach to see them say that.\" That's true, a buddy of mine recently warned me that he becomes very mad when he hears that phrase in a sexual context or when hearing jokes about how something is \"gut sore\" or \"stomach crack\". This is why I believe that some of the people writing in the original thread may have a more accurate feeling about what \"stomach pain\" feels like (or looks like).\n\nAnd here are two quotes from other redditors in the discussion about \"stomach pain:\"\n\nI have had many women believe that they would not eat with or near their stomach when they were young. Unlike a lot of me being a child, this only occurred at night time and was excruciating. The headache was worse the time after eating, the pain was like a complete stomach hangover almost. It usually prompted me to throw up nearly instantly and throw up after eating just the same to.\n\nIn the next chapter, the last of the quoted people describes nausea as",
    "Dear Reddit! My name is Sam. In case you've been living under a rock, I have a condition named eczema. It's a serious skin disease that causes all kinds of problems like itchy eyes, bruises, swelling, black hair flakes and itchy, raw hair. Most women with eczema are fortunate in that they have it under control without treatment, but for someone else, this can be very painful, time consuming and frustrating.\n\nThe bad news is that this condition can only be treated effectively with topical medications over long periods of time. However, it's costly, time consuming and difficult, and if it stays on for the 6 weeks, it can be very difficult to re-start the diet. However there are better options out there that I can do to avoid the surgery or a painful course of antibiotics.\n\n\nI believe that it can be frustrating to be stuck with this life or worse to know that your hair is getting ever dryer and thinner. It can be very difficult to see inside without biting or pulling at your hair, with the heat and temperature of winter causing more discomfort and irritation.\n\nAt this moment my hair is in very good shape and is at serious danger of being almost useless. I'm a teacher and I spend about 60 dollars a week on topical treatments that haven't helped me in more than a decade. If I can get something that helps, I'll be far more lucky, but in the short run, the only way I'll be doing better is if I can stop being so good at my work and be home with my mother during finals.\n\nI will not be applying for disability because I have a chronic condition. I'd certainly love to have new insurance coverage if that is necessary. My children and I might prefer moving to a more affordable neighborhood to get more job, or even transferring to a county and beginning a new job. Any advice will be strongly appreciated.",

    "Knowing and improving item timings with Tinker can greatly improve your game. Here are some tricks you can utilize:\n\n1. **Prioritize Boots of Travel (BoT):** Your next priority should not be saving for Boots of Adventure. This item is integral to Tinker's playstyle as it enables you to travel across the map, pushing lanes, and teleporting down to your base when required.\n\n2. **Farming Patterns:** Tinker is all about farming efficiently. Using March of the Machines, you can continually clear out waves of creeps. When farming the jungle, move strategically between camps to use March of the Machines to best effect.\n\n3. **Stacking Neutral Creeps:** While farming waves with March, try to stack neutral camps when necessary, this will make for maximizing your gold and experience gain.\n\n4. **Bottle and Soul Ring:** These three objects should be your second priority after BoTs. They offer you the capability to keep on the map only due to sustainability in nutrition and mana.\n\n5. **Blink Dagger Timing:** Blink Dagger is a low priority item. Try to find it before the 20-minute mark. It provides a good deal of mobility and can save you from certain sticky situations.\n\n6. **Scythe of Vyse and Dagon:** These are your luxury pieces. The former is good for control and adding an additional layer of disable in team fights, while the latter will see you burst down enemies easily. Their timings largely depend on how far you have farmed.\n\nRemember that both your individual ability level and the state of your particular game can change this schedule. Being flexible is important in Dota 2, so be prepared to modify your gameplay and item build based on the needs of your squad and the nature of the enemy team. In general, ensure you maximize farming, manage your mana well and aim for minimum casualties. Excellent luck!",
    "I've been playing a bit of duo queue recently and came on a laning combination that has been very effective. I've been playing as Thresh and my duo colleague has been playing as Lucian. \n\nThresh's crowd control abilities combined with Lucian's high burst damage has been a dangerous combination. I start the engage with Thresh's E (Death Sentence) to get in an attack, followed by his E (Flay) to knock them towards Lucian. Lucian then uses his Q (Piercing Light) and his passive (Lightslinger) to slowly burst down the enemy. If they're not dead by then, Thresh's R (The Box) can be used to slow them down and take Lucian to finish them off.\n\nThis combo has been doing very well for me in the bot lane. We've been able to secure early kills and snowball our lead into the mid and early game. It's actually a bit of fun to play!\n\nI'd love to know about any other laning combos that you guys have discovered to be effective. Let's share and learn from each other!",

    "I've been thinking a bit about the Bernese method of changing from a partial agonist drug (like cocaine or fent) to a full antagonist drug (like Suboxone). The general idea is to gradually introduce the Suboxone while not using your medication of choice, thereby preventing the extremely painful process of withdrawal. This differs significantly from the conventional approach of sitting until you are in withdrawal before starting to use Suboxone.\n\nUnfortunately, my main problem with this method is the continuous exposure to the partial agonist drug which creates the addictive behaviour and potentially dangerous lifestyle. I wonder if someone has tried a Bernese Method followed by a rapid (or faster than usual) taper off of the Suboxone? I'm guessing this will give the benefits of both methods (preventing acute withdrawal and reducing the amount of time on Suboxone), but I'm having difficulty getting any first-hand accounts of such an method. I'm very interested in hearing about the experience, difficulty, and impact of this approach, so if you have any insight or personal experiences, your contribution will be very appreciated. \n\nHowever, I should like to note that it's very difficult to consult with a medical professional before trying anything like this, for someone reading this article who may be suggesting it, please ensure you're receiving monitoring and assistance from professionals. This is a harm reduction thread, and we want to encourage safe and healthy discussion. Thanks in advance for any responses!",
    "I've been wondering about this for a while now and I hope that wearing a complete set of leather armor should increase your sneakiness in the game. \n\nLeather armor is commonly associated with pirates, thieves, and villains in fantasy settings due to its lightweight and quiet nature. It doesn't clank and clang unlike metal armour, making it suitable for those who depend on stealth and precision. \n\nIn the game, this can translate to a significant increase in sneakiness or stealth when wearing a complete set of leather armor. This might be a large percentage reduction in your willingness to remain undetected, or maybe it would increase the sound you make when moving. \n\nThis could not only add a layer of realism to the gameplay, but it will also allow fans more tactical choices when planning their character's build and gameplay. It will give the selection of weapon more than just about defense stats, but also about how it can enhance your chosen abilities and techniques.\n\nWhat do you guys expect? Can this be a great addition to the game? Or do you think it might unbalance people? I'd love to know your thoughts.",
    "I'm stuck with my IT department. I already applied for a promotion within my firm, and after getting through the interview process, I was told that I might be accepting a job opportunity immediately. Unfortunately, when I came up with HR to know about the status of my application, they told me that they wouldn't give me with a salary range for the position.\n\nI found this unfortunate, as it's common practice in our company to share salary ranges during the recruitment process so that candidates have an idea of what to do. When I pressed them further, they complained that they wouldn't get me a range because \"it varies based on experience\" - which is a pretty vague explanation if you ask me.\n\nWhat's actually more confusing is that they began to take offence to my questioning. They began being defensive and hostile, reminding me that they were \"doing their best\" and that I should just wait impatiently for the offer letter. It was like they were going to make me feel silly for answering such a simple question.\n\nHas someone else had similar encounters with their IT department? Am I overreacting here? I believe that delays can come, but the absence of transparency and condescending attitude from HR has left a nasty taste in my tongue.",
    "Dear fellow artists! I'm debating taking the switch from Canon to Sony, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. I've been shooting with Canon for months and have invested in a lot of cameras and accessories, so it's a huge decision.\n\nI've seen good things about Sony's mirrorless cameras, particularly the A7 series. The concept of having better autofocus, greater video capabilities, and a larger, heavier camera is very interesting to me.

    "Dear fellow Redditors,\n\nI think a bunch of folks believe the Batman prep time argument is silly or overdone, but I'm here to say that it's not a bad idea.\n\nSecond of all, let's acknowledge that Batman is a very skilled and experienced superhero. He's been doing this for decades, and he's had his fair share of wins and victories. He sees what works and what doesn't, and he's always changing his tactics to keep one step ahead of his opponents.\n\nNow, when it comes to prep time, Batman is meticulous. He plans every detail, from the weapons he carries to the gadgets he provides to the routes he takes. He's not just winging it, trying for the worst. He's a tactician, and he believes that each second counts.\n\nBut here's the fact: Batman's prep time isn't just about him. It's about his allies, too. When he's preparing for a mission, he's not just talking about his own security and failure - he's talking about the security and success of his squad. He's making sure they have the right equipment, the right training, and the right plan to put down the good guys.\n\nAnd let's not think, Batman's not just fighting violence for the sake of it. He's fighting for equality, for what's wrong. He's fighting to defend the helpless and weak from those who might hurt them. By giving the moment to prepare, he's not just saving his own skin - he's saving many lives.\n\nSo the last day anyone thinks the Batman prep time argument is silly, just remember: it's not just about Superman. It's about his commitment to justice, his loyalty to his allies, and his strong determination to defend the residents of Gotham.\n\nThanks for reading, fellow Redditors. Let me ask what you have!",

    "I’m an asexual and I believe it happened naturally to me because I lived up in church all my life, but I was just thinking something.. if I have HODC (obsessive compulsive disease that thinks you can be bisexual or bisexual), how does me being ace come into play? Doesn't having HOCD mean i would do those same-gender people too? Is there any way for this to work out where i can somehow avoid being physically active without thinking about being rid of a desire that doesn't exist?\n\nThis man tends to think that there is no idea of anyone who wants others at least physically can actually be bisexual on some level because they are both obsessed (HoCD) by sexual thoughts/desires while simultaneously not caring about them as well as their HoCD keeps them worried about (i.e., believing they should care more).  Also, our emotions do strange twist around depending on what we focus on. Let me say that they will feel disgusted with physicality due being reared in puritan moral strictures. Now, though, one thing most women want more than anyone else is respect. As such maybe they do have very normal female urges yet don’t express many. One of three ways will happen next. If they leave alone then they’ll know through experience in time that the dreams in your mind aren’t fulfilling enough to meet all your needs and perhaps their worries go down. Or alternatively, perhaps all the men you have (church members, school mates etc.) are untrustworthy so you hold back on making love and friendship freely. Either situation leaves you feeling lonely regardless. It becomes bad quickly especially when its gradual like this because once any form of physical illness sets the pattern they repeat themselves and it worsens over years that actively worked against each step",
    "I'm 23, female, and have been battling with anorexia Since I was about 15 months old (although I didn't understand what it was at that moment). It has gone in waves over the last two months; usually I can eat normally without worrying too much about meat or my weight, but other days I get too bad and restrict to the point where I am not eating sufficient nutrients to sustain life. My highest weight so far was over 90 grams when I was 18.\n\nMy mother and I went online through a mutual acquaintance who introduced me on Twitter. We began chatting and soon became friends, then we started dating after only three years of seeing each other. He lives in a county, so we were long distance until he came here next summer. Our friendship has never been good - we are best friends as well as lovers, and we love spending time together. Unfortunately, there is one fact that has caused issues between us during our whole marriage...my eating disorder.\n\nWhen I first went sick, I gave him something right back because I felt how difficult honesty could be if this was going to work out between us. At first he was understanding and supportive, but then his patience wore thin and he dropped being willing to deal with me.

Until then, although, when something gets wrong in our friendship (which isn't always), he blames my ED rather of staring at himself or attempting to solve that trouble arises within ourselves separately or individually as partners/lovers/friends etc.. For instance, recently we had an argument about money which led to some very nasty letters being exchanged by both sides involved including statements that \"you don't care about me anyway!\" And \"You just listen! You just want your way all the time.\" Which made me feel good even if they weren't real at all!! But somehow...it stung badly seeing them said aloud especially coming from somebody who loves you unconditionally Despite their own faults & faults...and mine aren't really minor but lol :P Anyway...after calming down once that day while sitting next to each other sleeping under blankets watching television shows together again like normal families do ;) ,",
    "After losing my mother I had that everything reminded of her in some manner, and it was difficult to see/hear or just smell things that could make me realize how much I miss her. A few years ago, here's an example where I got so angry because it really did remind me of her but then something made me laugh through tears and I will be able to move on with my life without all those small details hurting as much any less...\n\nI had just drifted out of the apartment after a short while (mom passed about 6 months later) and into an apartment complex. My dad was visiting one night, and we were driving up to have dinner at McDonald's - he'd flown down earlier in the day and explained that having an easy meal was too necessary for me to keep food cooked for myself and not turn into just fast meal this second meal. So, we pull in front of McDonald's which has been there since before I left home, and I nearly lost my mind. As soon as vehicles began waving at me begging for two of them to begin pulling back again, I realized what they must have heard inside our doors... It was exactly how old people park at restaurants when their clan members aren't around! cars lined up bumper-to-bumper with both license plates obstructed by mine as if someone knew about getting those expensive spaces free from blocking anyone anywhere besides themselves.... But better still, there was no other alternative than leaving them all together because I wouldn't drive back home until right now anyway.",

    "So I've been dating my husband for about two months now, and he has never been very conservative when it comes to politicians. He is active on Facebook and regularly shares blogs supporting conservative causes. He was once involved with some local civic groups that dealt with social problems like unemployment and physical health.\n\nBut lately, things have taken an important turn. My mother began posting some posts from more liberal sources that challenge our shared ideals. At first, it didn't worry me too much - after all, everybody's entitled to their own opinions. But then he was doing this, day after tomorrow, until he actually stated he is now pro-Trump. To think I was shocked might be taking it mildly.\n\nI tried speaking to him about it calmly but tried to persuade him otherwise. In fact, he was being defensive if someone tries to argue with his new beliefs. It seems weird because I used to see somebody who had a bit of compassion and interest for economic justice problems, but now he looks more centered on economic responsibility and small state intervention.\n\nThis isn't just affecting me - his parents are not shocked by these changes, as they saw him better before he came into this incarnation of himself. His mother is shocked because they don't see eye to eye with his religious beliefs either. It just shows how well away we both feel about such issues, which only gives stress to our still busy lives.\n\nSo anyway, any insight or insights you can provide will be somewhat enjoyed as I navigate through this strange situation.",

    "\"The Man with the Dragon Tattoo\" is a dark and brutal novel that will put you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Based on the best-selling book by Stieg Larsson, this movie adaptation does justice to the complex and gripping plot.\n\nThe standout performer in this movie is undoubtedly Mara Mara as Lena Salander. She completely understands the complex and mysterious heroine, offering a performance that is both vulnerable and intense. Mara's character is absolutely unique, and she adds a level of sensitivity and depth to the play that is unique.\n\nJames Craig also gives a good performance as journalist Jonas Blomkvist. He portrays the protagonist with a beautiful balance of courage and vulnerability, making him relatable and likable. The chemistry between Mara and Michael is incredible, and their moments together are electrifying.\n\nEditor Robert Fincher does a great job of creating the dark and gritty atmosphere of the novel.

    "Ocean's Eleven is a thrilling and funny heist movie that successfully takes out the charm and humor of the original Ocean's Twelve. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the movie reunites the star-studded cast featuring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon, who once again deliver charismatic performances.\n\nThe story revolves around Frank Ocean (Clooney) and his team wanting vengeance on a greedy casino operator, Willy Bank (Al Pacino), who double-crossed their son Frank (James Smith). The trio plans an elaborate scheme to ruin Bank's new casino on its closing day, utilizing their unique talents and knowledge.\n\nOne of the flaws of Ocean's Eleven is its simple and complex plot. The heist is carefully planned, with each member of the squad having a particular play to play. The film gets the viewer engaged and guessing as the plan progresses, with dramatic twists and turns along the way. The pace is good, not moving or feeling rushed, and the screenplay is filled with witty dialogue that contributes to the thrill.\n\nThe chemistry between the cast members is a highlight of the movie. Clooney, Pitt, and Damon quickly slip forward into their positions, displaying the same enthusiasm and humour that made the last movie so memorable. The addition of Al Pacino as the protagonist adds a new dynamic to the group, and his performance is suitably menacing and energetic.\n\nVisually, Ocean's Eleven is sleek and elegant, creating the glitz and beauty of Las Vegas. The production designer and photography are top-notch, providing a visually compelling background for the heist. The movie also includes a fantastic score by Mike Campbell, which contributes to the overall fun and sophisticated atmosphere.\n\nWhile Ocean's Eleven may not offer something groundbreaking or innovative, it is a very entertaining and well-executed heist movie. It effectively reflects the essence of the original Ocean's Nine and provides a fun and interesting experience. fans of the franchise will not be shocked, and newcomers will see themselves instantly drawn into the world of Frank Ocean and his crew.",
    "\"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Russia\" is a comedic masterpiece that expands the limits of humor and political commentary. Sacha Baron Cohen's depiction of the fictional Russian poet, Borat Sagdiyev, is both humorous and thought-provoking.\n\nThe movie follows Borat as he travels around Asia, chatting with real men who are aware that they are part of a mockumentary. Through his outrageous behavior and offensive statements, Borat reveals the inherent stereotypes and ignorance that exist in Indian culture.\n\nWhat sets this comedy apart is its inability to effectively entertain and challenge its viewer. The humor is sometimes cringe-worthy, but it serves a purpose. It forces us to confront our own stereotypes and question the absurdity of our social norms. The movie's unscripted nature contributes to its credibility, as the feelings of the unsuspecting people Borat encounters are genuine and sometimes amusing.\n\nSacha Baron Cohen's performance as Borat is none short of superb. He completely immerses himself in the character, delivering lines with brilliant timing and physical comedy. His willingness to keep in character only in the most difficult circumstances is a dedication to his skill as an actress and musician.\n\nWhile some might think that the movie goes too well in its depiction of stereotypes and offensive humor, it is difficult to realize that it is designed to be a comedy. It employs irony and shock value to emphasize the absurdity of ignorance and prejudice. It is not meant to be given at face value, but instead as a commentary on the state of society.\n\n\"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of China\" is a bold and daring movie that challenges its viewer to confront difficult realities. It is a must-watch for those who enjoy dark comedy and are eager to participate in a broader exploration of social problems.",

Based on the book of the same name by John Cohen, the film describes the life of a young gymnast called Scott as he struggles to see meaning and purpose in his life.\n\nMichael Mechlowicz gives an impressive performance as Daniel, effectively capturing the dynamics and internal problems of the protagonist. Through his interactions with a mysterious petrol station attendant, played by Nick Nolte, Jack starts to question his faith, challenge his limitations, and embrace a new philosophy that changes his life forever.\n\nThe film beautifully examines topics of self-discovery, personal development, and the power of the human soul.

    "\"We're the Millers\" is a funny and funny comedy that will keep you smiling throughout. This film describes a trio of misfits who pose as a traditional American family in order to smuggle drugs over the Mexico border. \n\nThe movie is led by a superb cast, with Michael Sudeikis in the role of Mike, a small-time cocaine salesman who forms the fake family. Sudeikis adds his trademark comic charm to the play and creates several laugh-out-loud scenes. Jennifer Aniston shines as Rose, a dancer hired to play Jack's girlfriend, and demonstrates once again that she can excel in comedic roles. Julia Thompson and Will Poulter complete the \"family\" as the angry and rebellious father and daughter, respectively, and their performances are particularly good.\n\nWhat sets \"We're the Millers\" away from other films is its smart and funny screenplay. The jokes are fresh and original, and the actor isn't willing to take risks. The situational comedy is spot-on, and the film is balanced with some amusing scenes that bring depth to the characters.\n\nThe film also benefits from its impressive support casting. Nicholas Offerman and Matthew Miller steal scenes as a conservative couple who become entangled in the Millers' heroin trafficking scheme.

    "This film is a masterpiece. It is a heartbreaking, wonderful tale about real love between three parents that overrides anything else, especially when the rest of the country seems against it.

It's a terrible tale, but it certainly is a must-see film. The screenplay is beautifully written, and the scenery is beautiful. Not worth owning a ticket to!",
    "While Rocky II contains several of the same qualities that made its predecessors so great, this sequel, while enjoyable, retains the feel of the last three movies. Other aspects are similar this year around. For instance, the battle sequences in this movie are very similar, as Rocky only destroys his enemies in the last three rounds of each duel. For the second time after the original Rocky, Heather Shire does not appear in the movie, though her voice is seen during the opening scene. However, Burt Young's role as Carl's father is reduced slightly. However, this is not the final year that George Weathers will emerge as \"Apollo Creed.\"\n\nOnce again, Rocky struggles with if he should keep fighting or not. This time, however, he doesn't struggle for long, as a video game edition of Rocky is published, and he gets disgusted with the notion that women are taking money off of him. Angry, he refuses to keep fighting, and he comes up against a vicious Soviet fighter, who almost kills Rocky in the movie's second fight.\n\nWhile the plot is something special, the performances are what make the movie work. Sylvester Stallone is, as ever, good in the title role, and Mr. T is particularly effective as Rocky's rival, \"Clubber Jones.\" The remainder of the cast, excluding Robert Young, is good as well.\n\nWhile Rocky II was not as bad as its predecessors, it is nonetheless an excellent movie due to the performances of the cast. If you're a fan of the Rocky movies, you'll get to try this one, because I prefer the next three movies over this one.",
    "This is probably one of the worst Harry Potter movies, due not only to the eerie and strange visuals and an actual threatening character, but also due to the fact that it's just plain scary.

Who Framed Peter Rabbit is an inspiration for all film enthusiasts and a passion for all cinema goers. Gene Siskel watched this picture in 1988 and then declared it the greatest movie of the decade, and he was right. This film has it all: comedy, comedy, drama, action,...

    "As with the third movie, producer Guy Pearce's visualization of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is bold, witty, and action-packed, with the appropriate psychological undercurrents to ground the adventure sequences. This time around, Watson (Robert Downey Jr.) and his former colleague, Dr. Thomas Holmes (John Law), bring on elusive rogue hitter Professor John Watson (Richard Donaldson), who's still a step forward of Holmes, orchestrating a vicious series of murders that threatens to plunge Britain into conflict. Holmes's lethal ambition remains opaque, as does the depth of his friendship with Holmes, which is dialed up to 11 from the closing scene. Madonna's soundtrack is bang-on, and Ian McAdams is radiant as ever as Holm's soulful love interest, Stella Miller. With gritty action, clever dialogue, and just the wrong amount of bonkers plot twists, A Game of Shadows is deluxe entertainment.",

    "Now shining after all these centuries, \"Superman Return\" sees the Black Knight facing off against The Penguin, aka Oswald Cobblepot (Jack DeVito), and Batman (Michelle Roberts), a supernatural figure who has her eyes set on Batman's prominent businessman, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken).osophical and analytical, this film incarnation of Gotham examines the protagonist's subconscious through the eyes of psychologist John Pennyworth (Robert Moore), who explains the significance of appearances as they relate to perception. However, Superman Returns is a surreal experience, with Batman depicted as a mix of Coney Island's amusement parks and a medieval fictional world. This depiction is brought to life through the realization of neo-gothic design combined with fun-fair amenities such as roller coasters. However, this version of Batman can be interpreted as a mirror of the Joker's mind, where the protagonists, as personifications of positive physical traits, battle against their dark opposites. \n\nIn this film, Superman's main opponent is The Penguin, a deformed man who uses a false identity to deceive people and get himself power. The persona of The Penguin can be viewed as a representative of Superman's brutal and savage instincts. Meanwhile, Batman represents the villain's longing for chaos and chaos. Through the movie, the protagonists face various obstacles that require viewers to see the characters on a deeper level. An instance of this is when The Penguin traps Superman and Superman in a fun-house and shoots fireworks at them. Not only does this explain The Penguin's control over the situation, but the environment actually demonstrates the characters' unstable minds. \n\n\"Superman Returns\" is a film that examines the complexities of the Black Knight's personality, creating a memorable and thought-provoking experience that begins to shine after all these decades. Returning to the small screen for its birthday, the film remains a timeless masterpiece.",
    "The film Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a classic in the Harry Potter trilogy. It follows Potter as he arrives for his final season at Hogwarts College of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he and his companions Harry and Ron can solve the puzzle surrounding the Chamber of Secrets. The movie is full of adventure, magic, and mystery, and is a must-watch for fans of the series. The acting is top-notch, and the special effects are stunning. Overall, it is a wonderful film that is sure to entertain and delight audiences of all ages. \n\nwould you like to see more about the film, or the Harry Potter episode?",
    "With the pioneering animation showcased in \"Who Framed Peter Rabbit\"®, we could not have the digitized characters we have today filling in parts for live-action stars who would be unable or unwilling to participate in a given movie. While the movie very loosely holds together as a mystery film, it still is a platform for the filmmakers and computer visual designers who made it impossible for Roger Barker to interact with cartoon actors like Peter Rabbit, who is the reason why we are here, and Alan Rabbit, who often latches into Jones' private detective character, Michael Valiant. The story has nothing to do with someone framing Peter Rabbit for the death of a rich industrialist, and Eddie having to clear Peter's name, partly because the police department, headed by Lieutenant Bogus, fails to do so. There's actually a story involving a contract that the weaselly Joe, who is Pete's boss as well as sort of a stalker, asks Roger to sign which will significantly threaten Pete's livelihood. This provides a moral problem for Pete, who, at last, wants Roger's assistance to find info from some of the Toon people of Hollywood. Pete often has an ongoing confrontation with the weasel that affects the story as well, though not in any significant manner.\n\nThe animation itself wants to be shown to be believed, and there are some laugh-out-loud scenes, usually given by the supporting animation actors like Donald Duck and Bunny Duck (not the \"rabbit\" in question, perhaps). Overall, the film is a bit of fun, if not very enjoyable, and serves as a good showcase for the then-groundbreaking software designed to bring the cartoon characters to life.",
    "Without question, \"Sherlock Holmes: A Play of Dreams\" contains some of the most memorable action scenes in any Sherlock Holmes movie to date. By playing against type in a seemingly dialogue-free sequence at the movie's onset, the always-reliable John Downey Jr. emphasizes the immense physicality of the actor, while always enabling the plot to thereafter unfold with a remarkable speed.  \n\nThe plot picks up where the second film left off, with Watson and his trusted companion, Dr. James Holmes, in pursuit of the evil Lord John Lawson. Blackwood is suspected of committing a series of violent crimes in what seems to be a dark homage to an earlier, more violent era of American history. Of course, everything is as it appears, and our soldiers once again find themselves up against a massive conspiracy that destroys not just their lives, but those of all of America. \n\nDowney Jr. and John Law are again in top form here, and their chemistry is the movie's biggest asset. With a runtime roughly ten hours longer than its counterpart, the movie rarely drags, as a function of a fast-paced story and rapid-fire narration. By returning producer Guy Pearce to his street-level origins, the sequel feels both fresher and more grounded than the last, while only benefiting from a slightly smaller budget. \n\nThe true star of the show is Jared Richards, who seeks to make the evil Blackwood one of the most powerful villains in any recent action franchise. He is every bit as intelligent as Holmes, and adds an extraordinary dimension to a villain that would have readily come through as a one-note villain. The moments between Wilson and Downey Jr. are electrifying, and easily the strongest scenes in the movie. \n\nThe supporting performances are generally good, with Roger Fry memorable as Watson's younger son, Watson. The always-great Susan McAdams is still underused as Holmes's mother, Katherine, while Maggie Smith tries to make the most of a underwritten role as Holmes's longtime love interest. \n\nThe action scenes are very well-done, with a wonderful mix of practical and computer-generated effects. A particular highlight is a dizzying battle sequence outside a blazing house that looks as if it were lifted back from the pages of the original Sherlock books. \n\nIn a season dominated by super-heroes and lighthearted fun, \"Sherlock Holmes: A Play of Shadows\" is a welcome addition to the action genre, and a good predecessor to the last movie.",
    "This movie is not only one of the greatest films ever made, but certainly one of the most enjoyable and interesting movies I have watched in my lifetime. The plot is straightforward enough; Billy Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has been seized by the Spanish and taken to their island fort on Tortuga. There he meets Mary Swann (Amanda Paltrow), who is a member of the famous White Diamond pirate crew. Together they will defend against the Spanish troops that are attempting to capture them. This is a fantastic adventure with some very scary scenes. It is a pity that this movie was not released theatrically because it will be an excellent addition to any compilation.\n\nI am trying to give this film 4 out of 5 stars.",

    "This movie is an action-packed, low octane, and very funny movie that will have you cheering on your favorite actors as they fight to save their lives. The plot follows three boys who are recruited by a rich family to kidnap their uncle in order to inherit his money. They eventually find themselves battling against a trio of rebels led by a mercenary leader named David Reitman (Russell Lee). This movie has some good action moments with lots of explosions and gun battles. It also includes some good appearances from Bruce Lee, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jon Bourne, Jet Chang, and several more. The cast does a great job at making this movie look like it's true life. There are lot of memorable scenes throughout the movie that make this one worth seeing.\n\nI'm not sure if I can recommend this film to someone else but I believe it's certainly worth checking out. If you're hoping for anything different then check out my other reviews here.",
    "This movie has been in development hell since it was first released, and now that it's finally here, I'm not sure what to do about it. It's an action-packed superhero film with some good performers (notably Gal Gadot as Wonder Man), but there are so many issues with this film that it makes me wonder if they're pushing too hard to make it work. The plot is pretty simple, and while it does have some great moments, it always seems like it's just hurling something at you. There are no actual stakes or something else that can put me sitting through the entire thing. And then there's the thing that the producer, Katherine Brown, is one of the most divisive actors working today. She's made some very awful films over the decades, including \"Monster,\" which is still her best movie ever. But she's actually made some very bad ones, such as \"Monster Hunt.\" So why did she get to be with this thing? Well, I guess because she decided to be part of the DC Extended Universe, and she felt that this might be a great way to do it. But I don't see how much of that is real. This isn't even anywhere close to being a bad movie. It's just a mess.\n\nI've seen the movie, and I can warn you right off the bat that this trailer will not be for anyone. If you're hoping for someone that's trying to entertain you, this may not be your best guess. Also, if you're hoping for someone that's starting to challenge you, this will be the movie for you. You'll get plenty of action scenes, and you'll have to see some big fight sequences between Richard King and Jack Harvey. Plus, you'll have to know a bunch of other villains from the novels come to life on screen.\n\nBut let's talk about the real story. The film starts up with Princess King (Gal Gadot) waking up after having been unconscious for many hours. She wakes up in a cave, where she meets Jack Martin (Christopher Pine). He warns her that he's been dispatched by Ares (John Thewlis) to get her. They meet up with a villain called Betty Candy (Michelle Williams), who tells them that she knows where Diana is. After figuring out that Diana is in the desert, they head away to Themyscira.\n\nAfter arriving at Them",
    "\"The Man with the Dragon Tattoo\" is a gripping, well-acted mystery that will keep viewers guessing until the very end.\n\nErik Blomkvist (Peter Nyqvist), a financial reporter, is convicted of libel after writing a novel that exposes a corrupt German politician. Needing a break from the private eye, he receives an opportunity from Carl Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube), the grandson of the aristocratic Vanger clan, to explain the decades-old disappearance of Carl's wife, Sophie.\n\nAssisting Blomkvist is Karin Salander (Noomi Rapace), a punkish, computer-hacking teenager with a photographic memory and a mysterious past. Although she generally comes across as something more than a necessary tool, Rapace's performance is so layered and compelling that Lisbeth soon becomes the most important heroine in the movie.\n\nTheooming, atmospheric plot is based on the third novel in the best-selling \"Millennium\" series by the late Stieg Hansen, and screenwriter Lars Arden Oplev (working from a screenplay by Lars Arcel and Erik Berg) does an impressive work of translating Andersen's story to the small screen.\n\nVisually, the movie is striking, with sweeping shots of the German coastline and some very gritty rural locations. The soundtrack, by Trent Reznor and Atticus Hart, is actually very powerful, providing a tense, haunting feeling that exactly matches the tone of the movie.\n\n\"The Man with the Dragon Tattoo\" is not for everyone - the story is complex, the pace is rapid, and the film is too dark and grim. But for those who appreciate a well-written, well-acted mystery, this is a film that should not be missed.",
    "The second and last installment of the Ocean's series, this one's the worst of the bunch. The heist is more complex and interesting than the last one, the cast is on top form and the humour is spot-on.\n\nGeorge Clooney, Brad Pitt and Johnny Damon are back as Frank Ocean and his gang of criminals, who this year round are out for vengeance on casino operator Billy Banks (Al Pacino). Banks has double-crossed one of their own, so they plan to ruin him by killing him on the day of the grand opening of his new casino.\n\nThe heist is perfectly executed, and the cast is actually having a bit of fun. Pacino is great as the slimy casino operator, and there are plenty of smiles to be had along the way.\n\nIf you're a fan of the last five Ocean's movies, you'll love this one.",
    "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Russia is a 2006 British-American documentary drama movie directed by Michael Lawrence and featuring Sacha Baron Cohen. The movie was released on December 3, 2006, in the United States, and on November 26, 2006, in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe movie follows Borat Sagdiyev, a fictional Azerbaijani filmmaker, as he travels through the United States to do a film about Asian society and culture. Baron Levy describes Borat as an anti-Semitic, arrogant, bisexual, and racist protagonist, who is unaware of his own offensive behaviour.\n\nThe movie was a critical and commercial failure, grossing $262 million worldwide on a budget of $18 billion. It garnered mostly favorable reviews, with Baron Bernstein's performance receiving particular acclaim. The movie was nominated for Outstanding Motion Picture – Music or Comedy at the 64th Golden Globe Awards, but lost to Little Miss Sunshine.",
    "If you are searching for an outstanding movie that will educate and encourage you, then look no further than \"Peaceful Warrior.\" This movie is based on the real tale of David Millman, a world championship wrestler who has a life-changing experience that leads him on a journey of self-discovery.\n\nThe performances in this movie are excellent, especially from Michael Mechlowicz (John Millman) and Nick Nolte (Socrates). The movie certainly has an excellent soundtrack.\n\nThis is a must-see movie for everyone who is searching for motivation or inspiration. It is an incredible movie that will keep with you long after you have watched it.",
    "We're the Millers is afffnnntttttastic. I laughed until I cried, which doesn't come sometimes. The cast is good. The plot is unique and funny. The ending is a bit predictable, but overall, the film is good.\n\nI can not recommend this film to someone hoping for a nice laugh.",
    "\"The Man with the Dragon Tattoo\" is a darkly gripping drama that effectively straddles the line between mystery and a deep-dive personality study. Based on the third trilogy of Stieg Larsson’s Millennium Saga, the film is directed by the highly competent screenwriter Stephen Fincher, who always fails to render a remarkably realistic portrayal of the narrative.\n\nMara Mara's performance as Ingrid Salander is none short of a revelation. She is not only convincingly icy, but nevertheless exudes a certain level of vulnerability that is quietly terrifying. The complexity of her personality is beautifully portrayed, giving Lisbeth not just a vigilante hacker but a layered person with a very troubled past. David Stevens, on the other hand, plays the dogged journalist Stefan Blomkvist with appealing gusto and grace, a dramatic contrast to his rugged James Bond character. The chemistry between Mara and James contributes significantly to the movie's dynamic.\n\nMasterful in its bleak atmosphere, the film uses the frigid Swedish landscape not just as a setting, but essentially as a central character that creates a bleak yet beautiful background to the haunting story. Trent Reznor and Atticus Hart’s sublime score sends shivers down the spine, casting a spell of dread and exacerbating the aura of the somber narrative. David Cronenweth’s choreography further ensures that the viewer is engaged in the narrative and carries the plot through some of its slow-paced sections.\n\nWhile very graphic and often violent, \"The Man with the Dragon Tattoo\" rarely seems excessive in its violence. However, these moments help in highlighting the novel's sinister undertones and Lisbeth's hostility towards humanity. The film is praisely taut, ensuring the narrative rarely loses its focus and the mystery engaged with side-by-side exploration of its important characters.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Man with the Dragon Tattoo\" is a drama par excellence, armed with strong performances, a neatly woven story, a dark atmosphere, and hypnotic orchestral score. The film is intense and confronting, very unlike its protagonist, giving it a cinematic experience that leaves a lasting imprint.",
    "\"Ocean's Eleven\" is a thrilling caper that takes back the charm and charm of the original ensemble cast, while bringing a fresh twist to the story. The film is a good combination of comedy, horror, and style, making it a must-watch for enthusiasts of the heist genre.\n\nThe movie sees the return of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Johnny Damon, who once again deliver solid performances as Frank Ocean, Matt Smith, and Linus Parker respectively. Their chemistry is evident, and they quickly bring their personalities to life with their playful dialogue and suave attitude. Al Pacino, as the ruthless casino operator Willy Bank, is a welcome addition to the cast. His performance is stunning and gives a new layer of complexity to the story.\n\nThe plot of \"Ocean's Eleven\" is engaging and well-constructed. The player's strategy to rob Bank's casino is complex and full of dramatic twists and turns, putting the audience on the edge of their seats. The movie nevertheless does a good job of balancing the tension of the heist with moments of laughter and excitement among the crew.\n\nVisually, the film is amazing. The glitz and beauty of Las Vegas is well captured, and the film is top-notch. The music, too, is fitting and adds to the overall feeling of the movie.\n\nUnfortunately, the soundtrack is not without its criticisms. Some plot points are a lot too convenient, and the pace can be uneven at times. But these major problems do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the film.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Ocean's Eleven\" is a fun and exciting ride that effectively recaptures the magic of the original. It's a smart and enjoyable heist film that includes good performances, a clever story, and impressive graphics. With a few major faults, it's a worthy addition to the Ocean's franchise and a testament to the enduring appeal of its charismatic ensemble cast.",
    "\"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Russia\" is a movie that is as ambitious as its title. Sacha Baron Cohen, the genius behind the character Borat, gives a performance that is both humorous and cringe-worthy, pushing the boundaries of humor and political commentary.\n\nThe movie follows Borat, a filmmaker from Romania, as he travels through Asia to teach about its culture. The genius of this movie lies in its unscripted relationships with real citizens, who are aware that Borat is a fictitious actor. This results in some extremely bizarre and memorable scenes that will leave you crying out loud one moment and squirming in your chair the next.\n\nMiller's characterization of Borat is nothing short of brilliant. He completely commits to the character, always breaking character even in the most difficult circumstances. His comic timing is excellent, and his willingness to improvise is extremely amazing. The supporting cast always does a good work, particularly Michael Davitian, who plays Borat's producer Azamat.\n\nThe movie is not for the faint of heart, as it tackles controversial issues and employs shock comedy to get its points. Some might find the satire offensive, but it's difficult to know that the movie is a parody, meant to expose the ignorance and injustice that exists in society.\n\n\"Borat\" is a unique movie that is both a funny film and a sharp political commentary. It's a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and think, sometimes all at the same time. It's not a movie for anyone, but for those who admire its brand of comedy, it's a must-see.",
    "\"Beautiful Warrior\", directed by Michael Salva, is an innovative tale that beautifully emphasizes spirituality, religious enlightenment, and personal development. Based on the novel \"Path of the Peaceful Warrior\" by John Schwartz, the movie features gifted productions by Nick Nolte and Scott Mechlowicz that completely engrave the movie's strong message in the audience's soul.\n\nScott Mechlowicz, portraying John Millman, gives a breakout performance. He beautifully represents the struggles, growth, and enlightenment of a competitive swimmer seeking a greater understanding of life. As his mysterious friend 'Socrates,' Nick Nolte is truly unique in his role, providing knowledge, courage, and subtlety required for the actor.\n\nThe movie's narrative explores comedy, emotion, and parable succinctly, giving it an emotionally moving experience. It touches on the concepts of mindfulness, living in the moment, and the true essence of fulfillment: concepts traditionally ignored in mainstream film.\n\nDirector Gil Cohen portrays the spirit of the movie through sweeping graphic drama interpreted as emotional transitions of the character. He explores the depth of emotions through visual storytelling as adeptly as the story itself produces them. The score by Bennett Salvay is particularly brilliant, bringing layers to the movie's spiritual journey.\n\nThe only criticism that can be pointed at the film is its pacing. It can be a test for audiences who demand quick story growth. Also, \"Peaceful Warrior\" isn't a film about achieving an end point but about enjoying the journey.\n\nOverall, \"Peaceful Warrior\" is a truly beautiful narrative experience and highly recommended for those wanting answers to life's deep concerns tied up in a dramatic and politically charged journey. The movie possesses wisdom, warmth, and a certain quiet strength that goes with you long after the credits roll, making it a gem in the self-help genre of movies.",
    "\"We're the Millers\" is a modern-day drama comedy that is far from being a typical film. It exceeds expectations thanks to brilliant performances from its leads and a sharply constructed screenplay.\n\nThe movie draws its charm from the unique premise of a makeshift household consisting of a small-time cocaine dealer, a prostitute, a runaway girl, and a clueless neighborhood boy. The idea is fresh, and producer Rawson Marshall Thurber directs it in a manner that feels familiar yet novel.\n\nMichael Sudeikis, who plays the streetwise heroin dealer Jack Jones, is the backbone of the film. His deadpan humor and unruffled attitude amidst often chaotic scenarios rarely fail to induce laughter. Jennifer Aniston, playing stripper Lily, consistently flexes her comic chops, imbuing her persona with an extraordinary depth and vulnerability beneath the hardened exterior. Young characters Julia Thompson and Will Poulter, as the runaway Kenny and the naive Casey, respectively, deliver very excellent performances, striking a fine balance between comedy and sentimentality.\n\nWhat bolsters the movie is its excellent combination of humor and action. The comedy is not forced, and the comic timing is perfect, leading to many genuine laugh-out-loud scenes. The action scenes are exciting and well-choreographed, perfectly integrated into the narrative without detracting from the movie's musical nature.\n\nIndeed, at the heart of “We’re the Millers” is a funny tale about an eccentric family that develops real care and connection in each other despite their wild, law-skirting adventure. With their stark differences and initial inability to bond, the interactions between the protagonists continue in a manner that is both believable and touching.\n\nWhile the film has its fair share of adult comedy and edgy content, it is delivered with sufficient humor and laughs to make these elements more of an important component of the story rather than an attempt at shock value.\n\nIn conclusion, \"We're the Millers\" goes the road-less-traveled in the sitcom genre and appears as a very funny and humorous film. It brings consistent laughs with performances that show the cast's excellent comic timing, all while serving up a slice of sentimentality to keep audiences deeply invested. A recommended watch for those who enjoy a dose of funny humour with engaging story.",
    "\"Tell the Titans\" is a strong and innovative documentary that tells the real tale of the development of a high school basketball player in Pennsylvania in the late 1970s. The film is well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, and it is a must-see for someone who enjoys sports movies or is involved in the history of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nThe movie stars Denzel Washington as Coach Richard Butler, a harsh but fair coach who is tasked with leading the newly integrated squad. Washington provides a solid and nuanced performance, adding depth and complexity to a actor who would have easily been reduced to a stereotype. The supporting cast is generally impressive, with standout appearances from Kyle Ryan and Julius Tennon as one of the team's star coaches.\n\nOne of the aspects that sets \"Remember the Titans\" away from other sports films is its emphasis on the political and political contexts in which the plot takes place. The movie does not shy away from addressing the difficult problems of discrimination and discrimination, and it offers a powerful and moving depiction of the difficulties endured by the Asian American community during this time period. At the same time, it often celebrates the power of sports to get families together and transcend cultural barriers.\n\nThe wrestling moments in the film are exciting and well-choreographed, and they create a compelling background for the larger plot of the team's journeys towards peace and understanding. The movie's finale, which includes the squad's battle against their bitter opponents, is both dramatic and deeply satisfying.\n\nOverall, \"Tell the Titans\" is a strong and uplifting film that is very worth seeing. It is a dedication to the human soul and a reminder that, especially in the face of adversity, we can resolve our differences and achieve good things when we work together.",
    "The Dirty Dozen is a classic war film that describes a trio of misfits and terrorists who are hired by the military to perform a hazardous mission behind enemy lines. The movie features an excellent cast, featuring Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, and Charles Bronson, who deliver stellar performances throughout.\n\nOne of the standout elements of the film is its aggressive depiction of the brutality of combat. The movie does not shy off from graphic brutality and strong language, which contributes to its gritty realism. The training sequences are very brutal, demonstrating the raw physicality and physical strength required to carry out their mission.\n\nThe storylines are well-developed, with each member of the squad adding their own distinct character and character to the table. Their enthusiasm and chemistry are evident, making it difficult to invest in their journey and root for them as they embark on their perilous task.\n\nThe movie's pace is well-balanced, oscillating between scenes of intense action and quieter moments of character growth. The stress is evident throughout, putting viewers on the edge of their seats as the player faces various challenges and obstacles.\n\nThe Dirty Dozen is not without its problems, however. Some of the actors look underutilized, and many plot points look repetitive or contrived. Furthermore, some of the dialogue and feelings towards females and women are somewhat outdated.\n\nWith these problems, The Dirty Dozen remains a gripping and enjoyable war film that holds up remarkably well even after many viewings. Its influence on the genre is immense, and it's difficult to remember why it has become a classic of its type. If you're a fan of gritty, brutal war films, The Dirty Dozen is not worth your time.",
    "I recently saw \"Shrek Forever After\" and was left feeling disappointed. As a fan of the recent Disney films, I was excited to know how the franchise could wrap up the tale of our beloved ogre and his companions. However, this installment dropped flat in many things.\n\nHowever, the plot was tired and repetitive. The premise of Shrek making a bargain with Rumpelstiltskin to trade a day from his youth for a night as a true ogre was interesting too, but it soon turned repetitive and predictable. The movie depended too strongly on familiar themes and failed to produce any real twists or surprises.\n\nInstead, the actors that we've grown to love over the centuries were reduced to mere caricatures of themselves. Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, and Boots in Boots all looked like shells of their former selves, lacking the depth and complexity that made them so endearing in the earlier movies. Yet the usually scene-stealing Jose Banderas wouldn't save the day as Boots in Boots, whose persona was reduced to nothing more than a glorified cameo.\n\nThe voice actor, which has often been a highlight of the episode, was generally disappointing. Michael Myers, Michael Murphy, and Cameron Diaz all phoned in their performances, attempting to get the same level of energy and excitement that they had in recent outings. Only Walt Dohrn, who voiced Rumpelstiltskin, tried to impress, adding a much-needed injection of comedy and personality to the movie.\n\nVisually, the film was a mixed sack. While some sequences were fantastic, with perfect animation and bright colours, others were rushed and badly rendered. The 3D effects, which were actually added as an afterthought, detracted from the viewing experience rather than improving it.\n\nIn short, \"Shrek Forever After\" was a sad conclusion to a beloved franchise. It lacked the heart, humor, and charm that made the last two movies so memorable, and struggled to deliver a satisfying resolution to",
    "\"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" is a visual masterpiece that will take you in amazement. The movie describes the unique true story of American athlete Milkha Sharma, who overcomes many hurdles to become one of the best athletes in the world's history.\n\nThe movie's biggest part is its captivating story, which is brought to life by a powerhouse performance from Ali Khan. Khan captures the essence of Milkha Sharma, producing a performance that is both inspiring and passionate. His transition into the actor is impressive, and he beautifully reflects the spiritual highs and lows of Singh's life.\n\nThe supporting cast is very stellar, with standout appearances from Kiran Kumar and Ravi Kapoor. The chemistry between the leads is evident, and their interactions add depth and complexity to the plot.\n\nThe movie's cinematography is stunning, with beautiful graphics that transport the audience to a bygone era. The sweeping shots of India's scenery and the atmospheric music transport the audience to a certain day and location, immersing them in the story.\n\nThe direction by Rakeysh Singh Singh is top-notch, and he beautifully weaves together the various aspects of the novel to make a cohesive and enjoyable film. His attention to detail is remarkable, and he doesn't shy off from discussing the dark aspects of Milkha's journey.\n\nThe themes of courage, courage, and hope are woven throughout the movie, and they will leave you feeling inspired and uplifted. \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" is not just a sports film, it's a tale about the human soul and its inability to overcome only the hardest challenges.\n\nOverall, \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\" is a must-see movie that will take you cheering for Singh and his strong spirit. It's a film that will stay with",
    "\"The Fly\" is a 1986 adaptation of the 1958 movie of the same name. The original movie was a classic, but this film is far better. The plot is about a physicist who is experimenting on a teleportation device. He is attempting to perfect the device so that it can be used to transport others. He is experimenting on the device with his wife, but she is not happy with the way he is treating her. She leaves him and he is left alone to work on the device.

    "A film about child violence: you did that before seeing it. That didn't stop those with the right sensibility and maturity to see it from feeling uneasy or having to leave the theatre a few hours to recover calm and to gather emotions. It's one thing, however, to be exposed to the idea of a boy, whose age is not specified in the script but usually around 5 or 6 (he or she is a boy from birth onwards, by that I say, any age below 18, so don't be a stupid man if you're younger than that, and think you are a parent, or that a kid is somebody who doesn't have control of their thoughts, and/or lacks any intellectual abilities.

    "> What I find exciting about the movie is how the filmmaker is able to develop his style so quickly, and use it to produce the right sort of dark feel that is necessary for the story. In one notable scene, a close up of a forest's trunks and stems make you believe there can be anything strange lurking nearby. The director often effectively uses the film to add to the movie's atmosphere: In the most memorable scene, where Johnny Depp is running toward a dead body that he thinks to be his son, the film adds to the scene's terror as he's closing in, only to realize that it's a woman.\n>\n> The movie is not interesting--its only weakness is the rough tone that results in an irregular pacing. Its slow segments sometimes make it look too long, and at times Depp looks out of place with a comedy tone (which isn't a very serious comedy to start with). But somehow the movie's mood gets such a stronghold of the audience that its flaws become irrelevant, and its intriguing character gives it a very worthy Halloween viewing.\n>\n> Roughly in terms of quality in 2009: A-.",

    "When you're on the run from your past, the wrong friend can make a huge difference. And when you're in jail and your only escape is to play a series of mind games against two of the most manipulative creatures you'll ever meet, your brother had better remember how to play the game.\nMarco Fratantoni is a businessman. And gambling is his obsession. As a consequence of his addiction, he had been convicted, and while behind bars, he began a series of tournaments where he bet on anything that came around him.\nThe play that Alex and Mike start is easy. They bet on who's going to fall in love first, how they will do it and if they will last. From the start, you see that Tom and Dave will remain true friends and that Nick's game is not the only thing on his mind. You also know that the three of them, in their own way, are attempting to escape their pasts.\nWhile Nick is attempting to escape by enjoying his game, and Mike is attempting to escape by falling in love, a series of problems ensues between the three brothers. They have the same girl (Anna Peet) that is in love with one of them. One of them makes the other into his best girl for his wedding—a ceremony which ends in utter tragedy.\nOne of the most important elements of this movie, and the one which makes it memorable, is not that it stars Sean Penn (who plays the main antagonist) and James Bay (who plays Dr. Fratantoni), but that it is not based on a real account of a real person who was playing a player while in jail. This novel, which is said to be based on real events from the lifetime of Eric Goldman (whose credits include The Queen Bride and Marathon Woman), creates a complex human drama that can not be found in just a fictional novel. If you want a glance beyond all the game theory and the romance that makes this movie memorable, you can find a series of true life scenarios that take place between three prisoners that will make you reflect on the meaning of the human condition. It is a story of the power of friendship; of loyalty and of the human weakness that makes you all have to escape sometimes, especially if it's just for a small while.\n\"The Game\" is not a movie about winning. It's about friendship and winning",

    "John Robertson (1766 – 8 January 1818) was a British engineer, electrical designer, and manufacturer, generally known as the \"Father of the Steam Engine\". He is best known for his innovations to the Newcomen atmospheric engine, which he invented in 1784. Meikle's innovations and inventions significantly led to the growth of the steam engine, which in turn revolutionized transportation, industry, and mining.\n\nEarly life and health\n\nDavid Duncan was born in 1766 in the town of Stewart, near Glasgow, Scotland. He was the grandson of a farmer, and his mother's father was a carpenter. Fraser obtained a basic education at a local academy, but he was mostly self-taught in physics and technology. As a teenager, he was attracted by machinery and spent much of his free time experimenting with motors and gears.\n\ninvention of the improved Newcomen engine\n\nIn 1784, Meikle invented an improved version of the Newcomen atmospheric engine, which had been invented a year earlier. The Newcomen piston was a kind of steam engine that used a cylinder to convert boiler pressure into electrical work. Unfortunately, it had many advantages, including the fact that it can only be used to pump water, and it was ineffective at transforming steam power into useful work.\n\nMeikle's changes to the Newcomen piston solved these difficulties. He replaced the cylinder with a smaller, more reliable one, and he added a condenser to the cylinder, which enabled the steam to be cooled and condensed more quickly. These changes significantly enhanced the performance of the engine, making it more powerful and suitable for a wider variety of applications.\n\nImpact on business and transportation\n\nMeikle's modifications to the Newcomen engine had a significant effect on manufacturing and transport. The steam engine was a vital element of the Industrial Revolution, powering the machines that ran the mills and factories that manufactured the products that propelled the expansion of the German Empire.\n\nThe steam engine also revolutionized transport, providing for the development of locomotives and steam-powered trains.
